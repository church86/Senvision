Follow TechnoBuffalo Keeping track of airfares can be a difficult task. One day they’re down and the next, boom, they’ve doubled in price. Most of us just check daily, hoping that we’re getting the best deal when we finally give in and book. Now Google is making that task a bit easier. Google Flights, the company’s flight-search tool, will now let you know when it expects prices to jump. Google didn’t say how it works, but we assume it’s tapping into historical data that it’s uncovered by serving up flight results for multiple airlines and routes. In one example in the gallery above, you can see how Google shows a notification alerting the user that a price is likely to increase by $87 in about 8 hours. There’s no guarantee the price will actually increase, that’s the gamble you’re taking. Whether or not you want to put your trust in Google is up to you. Google also provides other insights, like information about alternate airports or dates that might be cheaper. Even better, you can choose to receive email notifications about specific routes. Google Flights to the rescue this season We’re about to enter the busiest travel season of the year, with Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Eve coming up. You’re bound to find yourself or loved ones looking for flights. We haven’t tested the new app for ourselves, but it certainly sounds like it’s going to make things a lot less stressful.

A recent weekday began like any other, with announcements and the Pledge of Allegiance. Then, things got interesting as they pulled out their Google Chromebooks and plugged into Google Classroom, a web-based, virtual learning platform. The assignment of the day was to type up a cinquain poem, using a template Nerland crafted in Google Document. “I think Google Docs has changed education and how teachers can teach now,” said Lynda Van Winkle, who spent the morning helping the second-graders navigate their online assignment. “And Google Classroom is just an added bonus.” Along with literature, the students are learning side lessons on word processing (for example, increasing the font size of their poem’s title) and keyboarding (Van Winkle sometimes marks each student’s finger with the home row keys for accuracy). Van Winkle is Aquarian’s technology inclusion specialist. In that role, one of her jobs is to figure out the best ways to integrate technology into the classroom “as a tool and not just a one-off, ‘We’re going to use a computer today with no real purpose,'” she explains. After two years of using Google Classroom, Van Winkle calls it revolutionary. “Teachers are able to give the feedback more immediately,” she said. “They can grade it all on a computer instead of carrying a bunch of papers home.” And the tech tools the students are learning will keep them ahead of the curve, she adds. “Those jobs they are going to have, these second-graders, some of them don’t even exist yet,” said Van Winkle. “So teaching students to use technology as a tool and not just a plaything is really important.” She says perhaps the only downside for the students is in how this changes “playing hooky.” Even if students aren’t physically in class, they can complete assignments anywhere they have access to the internet. “The skipping of school is not as fun as it used to be,” she laughed. “Because you can still be held accountable for things.” Contact Sierra Starks at sstarks@ktva.com and on Facebook and Twitter, @SStarksKTVA Related Stories News ‘Movember Makeover’ highlights importance of early cancer detection by Sierra Starks on Dec 02, 14:35 A recent assembly at the Aquarian Charter School brought a showdown of the best beards and mustaches, all grown during the month of November.

This feature does exactly what you’d think, it shows traffic jams, accidents, or anything else that might delay your ride, in the nearby area. This was added in the latest beta version of Google Maps for Android, and now offers an extra perk, a homescreen shortcut (via Android Police). Without the shortcut, you need to open Google Maps, look up directions, and tap to see nearby traffic. With the shortcut, however, you can immediately jump into those results. Adding the shortcut is simple, either add it from the widgets picker of your launcher, or add it from the Google Maps app in the traffic nearby section. To try out this feature for yourself, sign up for the Google Maps beta through the Google Play store. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

The built-in Google Flights tool easily gives me a quick overview of what’s out there and helps me find a good deal. However, that tool has just gotten way more useful. Today Google has announced, just in time for holiday flights, the addition of price notifications for flights you’re getting ready to book. When searching for a flight, Google will now show information about upcoming price changes, whether they’re going up or down. The information is all based on past flight data and won’t be accurate every time, but it should help you time your purchase in order to get the best deal. Better yet, if you find a flight but aren’t ready to purchase, Google will send you email notifications about price changes. Google has also revamped the interface for Google Flights on mobile but kept the tool on the web only instead of breaking it out into its own mobile app. Hotel searches also get an update, adding the ability to filter hotels by whether or not a deal is available. All of these changes are available now and should make planning trips even easier, especially combined with the recently announced Google Trips app… Guides Google View THe Guide Google Flights View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

To help make that traveling easier, Google is improving its Google Flights offering. Google Flights will now show you when prices for flights are expected to increase and how much it’s expected that they’ll go up. After you select a specific flight, you may see a notification that’ll tell you when the current fare is expected to end and how much it’ll likely go up. You can also get fare change notifications for multiple flights. When you’re looking at a route with many different flights, you might see a notification that’ll tell you how to get the best price, including tips for alternate routes and dates as well as when fares are expected to increase. If you’re not ready to buy right away, you can track a specific flight or route and have Google Flights email you when prices are expected to change. Google is also making it easier to track and manage saved flights on your phone. Also getting improved today is Google’s hotel search. Google already alerts you when a hotel’s price is lower than normal, but now you can search specifically for deals to get a feed of low prices. Google’s hotel search will also let you know when savings for loyalty club members are available. Do you use Google to search for flight or hotel prices?

Amy Gesenhues on October 17, 2016 at 3:34 pm More Google Flights announced today new updates around mobile notifications for airfare and hotel costs. According to a post on Google’s Official Blog, Google Flights will now display when a current fare is expected to expire for a selected flight, and how much will be saved if a user books now. With the new updates, searches for specific flights or routes may include notifications with tips on finding the best airfare. Google says tips can range from alternative airports or dates for a route or flight to expected airfare increases based on historic prices for a specific route. Over the coming weeks, Google Flights also will be rolling out email notifications for airfare price drops or increases for tracked flights and routes. In addition to price alerts around airfare, Google Flights is adding a new filter for hotel discounts: “Now if you want to only look at hotel deals — say, to ring in the new year in Paris — just tap in the upper left to filter for Deals and voilà!” Google says it will also alert users when savings are available to a hotel’s loyalty members.

Skip to content Menu Home Google Apps Script Examples TAGS TAGSExplorer TwtrService Twitter Archive Contact Form Search for: MASHe The musing of Martin Hawksey (EdTech Explorer) Home 2016 October Redux: How to open a Google Sheet at a specific row for editing Redux: How to open a Google Sheet at a specific row for editing Martin Hawksey October 17, 2016 Share this: | Twitter | Facebook | LinkedIn Many years ago I posted a way you could open a Google Sheet at a specific row for editing. This let you do some url wrangling where you could direct someone to open a Google Sheet in what was ‘List View’ and edit the row: Sadly List View disappeared in the Google Sheets update announced in December 2013. At the time an alternative way of doing this was to use cell comments to create a permalink. This is a nice but one of the things I liked about the ‘List View hack’ was you could use the url pattern to select a row with no additional work. Reviving with Google Script I hadn’t thought any more about this problem until I came across a post in the Google Apps Script Community: I linked to my Google Sheet, using Script Editor, javascript code that makes the sheet jump to the row that contains today’s date. However, the jump to today’s date row feature only works for people who have edit access to sheet. – Ellie Cohen, Google+ There was no code shared with the post but it got me thinking about how it might be done. As directly wrangling a Google Sheet url is no longer possible the idea was to expose a Google Script webapp that would store values as User Properties or User Cache which would then be used in an onOpen trigger. To make this work there is a couple of things to be aware of. Firstly, like other Properties/Cache Services  stored values are bound to the script. This means that if you write two different scripts and set a User Property or User Cache in one script you can’t get it in another: The Properties Service lets you store simple data in key-value pairs scoped to one script, one user of a script, or one document in which an add-on is used. … Properties are never shared between scripts. – Google Script Properties Service Guide A way around this is you have a library which is used to store and return properties, a feature I use in a number of my script projects. Add-ons are also single script projects. This means you can have run add-ons executing in multiple documents and access the same user property between documents. Deploying this solution as an add-on may be problematic as it would potentially run on every Google Sheet the user opened. With this in mind I’m going to show you how you can achieve an open row for editing behaviour using a library: Library Code To expose a url we can customise with row/sheet information we are going to deploy a Google Script webapp. This webapp is also going to be the library we attach to each Google Sheet we want to enable this open row functionality. For the webapp the script project has two files: code.gs (server side).  and index.html (client side), they both start like this: code.gs index.html The way this works is in code.gs we pass the querystring parameters into index.html. When index.html renders as a webapp the querystring parameters are passed to setCache(), which when executes successfully generates a url to the Google Sheet which is automatically opened using window.top.location.href When deploying the webapp it’s set to execute the app as the user accessing the web app and to anyone who has access to the app. This way the user cache is stored as the user. The code.gs has a coupe more lines used to return an onOpen behaviour: code(onOpen).gs The complete code.gs file is available on Github. The final piece is to include the library in the Google Sheet we want the open row functionality to happen. To do this create a new Google Sheet and open Tools > Script editor. In the Script editor open Resources > Libraries and in the Find Libraries box enter the script id 11ZaVyzV5H3yp5f-MxAlY04Z6FTJ-sYbkGZKNUqu8pCVLSVofUeIZA9Oa: Google Sheet code In the script editor we need to add an onOpen function passing the active spreadsheet to the library which has the user cache stored: function onOpen(){
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  OpenRow.showRow(ss);
} To open your sheet at a row for editing direct users to the following url replacing the values as indicated: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzG9_2mWd6x7zFf9V6PH33ORRzZWcVGi_pQs500nbs5Pbdkwy26/exec?id=YOUR_SHEET_ID&sheet=YOUR_SHEET_NAME&row=YOUR_ROW_NUMBER Optionally if you wish to include a header row when the sheet opens use &header=NUMBER_OF_ROWS_FOR_HEADER Note: This solution only works for users who have edit access to the sheet. You may also have to modify the code if you use protected ranges. As this solution relies on hiding rows it will cause problems if people are simultaneously opening particular rows for editing. If you’d like to see this in action try https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzG9_2mWd6x7zFf9V6PH33ORRzZWcVGi_pQs500nbs5Pbdkwy26/exec?id=1P4Lt0kEqzn2BDkK43GxChUebBR0Af3biwcT9ja4aCWg&sheet=Sheet1&row=5&header=1 (this is a sheet shared with anyone having edit access so it may get messy) You are welcome to fork this library and modify the functionality to meet your needs (source on Github). If you prefer not to use the library and deploy as a container bound webapp for a sheet you can. If you open a copy of this example you can publish as a webapp from Tools > Script editor Lessons learned along the way CacheService proved to be to unreliable for this. I’m not sure if it was down to the speed I was writing/reading values. It’s a shame because CacheService doesn’t require any permissions and values can have an expiration.

Laptops from HP, Dell, Toshiba, Lenovo, and more are prone to this issue. None of this software is included in Windows by default, so it’s not required for Windows to function. Some of the pre-installed branded programs, like photo and gaming apps, or those that duplicate Windows tools, are completely unnecessary.

Hmmm . . . I don't think the original writer will be please. Reply Tina Sieber October 27, 2016 at 10:31 am Jasray, I don't understand your comment. What comment was deleted here and are you sure you left your comment under the right article? This article is an original. Reply Quantum foam October 18, 2016 at 3:47 pm Agreed, but as I said, I think they are referring essentially to the Java Plugin, not the Java Runtime Environment. I wish the article's sub-heading had made that distinction clearer. Reply Tina Sieber October 27, 2016 at 10:25 am Thank you for your feedback! I believe Ben was referring to the Java browser plug-in, as well as the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) found under Programs and Features in Windows. Since the vulnerabilities are usually located in the JRE, it makes sense to remove both, though the browser plug-in is the most likely port of entry for malware exploiting weaknesses in Java. As you've pointed out though, several programs rely on the JRE to work, in which case only the browser plug-in should be removed. We'll add a note of warning to the article.

However most users don't run software that needs Java. But I think they are referring to the Java plugin here, which is a known soft target for threat vectors. And hardly any website nowadays uses that. I personally have only encountered it on the nVidia website where it users the plugin to auto gather system hardware data, when you are downloading drivers manually from their website and don't want to type in the graphics card model. That and one or two sites, non mainstream, in over 6 years. Reply Jouni "rautamiekka" Järvinen October 18, 2016 at 3:30 pm LibreOffice Base requires Java, as do Java macros for LO. Then there's Vuze.

But I believe most people will not use any of those applications. Yes, thousands or even millions would, but 100s of millions wouldn't. No one article will capture every use case, but for most people, they don't need JRE (and shouldn't even have it installed in the first place). The (relatively) few who run software that needs JRE will have to keep it installed, but the writer has commented above that they will update the article and acknowledge this use case exception. Ben Stegner October 31, 2016 at 3:25 pm Thanks for the responses here, everyone. Yes, my main point with including Java is that most people don't use much (if any) software that requires Java any more. Coupled with its security risks, the best strategy for most people is to uninstall Java, then reinstall if needed for some software. And of course, turn it off in the browser.

Will Alphabet Inc Destroy Samsung? Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Galaxy phones are blowing up. This could be an incredibly rare opportunity for Alphabet Inc (GOOG)(GOOGL) to cash in big. Samsung originally rushed its production of the Galaxy to beat Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) new iPhone release. Rushing the manufacture of a lithium-battery device turned out to be fatal, literally. A recent hardware defect caused the phone's batteries to catch fire. Samsung then rushed to design and manufacture a replacement Galaxy device, which itself started self-combusting. Only days later, Samsung called it quits, killing off its big-time smartphone. Google is ready to enter the massive smartphone market Already, Samsung's phones had relied on Google's Android smartphone operating system. Now in control of the software, it looks like Google wants to control the hardware too, similar to Apple's close-ecosystem model. It has a chance to do just that with its new Pixel smartphone line.   While the new pixel will be manufactured by HTC Corp, Google has been insistent on reminding investors, consumers, and the media that it controlled the design from day one, tagging the phone as "phone by Google." The Pixel has newer and better software than the newest Galaxy. Image by / c1.staticflickr.com It runs a faster processor, allowing it to tap into Google's new Daydream virtual reality platform. It also comes with free unlimited storage for pictures and videos. The new phones are made of aluminum and look remarkably like Apple's iPhone, complete with a large glass screen and a fingerprint sensor . Pricing starts at $649 for the smaller 5-inch model and scales to $869 for the XL version. Here's the proof A new survey conducted by Branding Brand suggests that Samsung device-owners are willing to switch to Google's new device. The survey included, among others, 1,000 Samsung smartphone owners. It found that 40% of respondents won’t be buying another device from Samsung. Nearly 10% are planning to switch and buy a new Google Pixel. Because the Google Pixel wasn't formally announced at the time of the survey, that number is likely much higher today. Last year, the global smartphone market was worth roughly $425 billion. Expect Google to command a decent chunk of that in coming years, possibly at Samsung's expense.

Ruslan Salakhutdinov, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, will assume the new position, which is meant to help the company make sure that Siri and its other products make use of the fundamental breakthroughs coming out of academic AI research. Salakhutdinov will talk about his research at EmTech MIT 2016, an MIT Technology Review conference held this week. Salakhutdinov researches very large neural networks used in a technology called deep learning, which lets a computer learn to perform a difficult task by consuming copious training examples. He will continue to work part time at CMU and will hire a team of researchers to work with him at Apple. The move is part of Apple’s effort to catch up in the race with Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other tech companies to gain an edge through recent advances in AI and machine learning. In particular, it is becoming increasingly important that software be able to learn for itself how to perform a task, using techniques like deep learning. The latest AI techniques are used in Google’s new smartphone, Pixel, for example. Its voice helper, called Assistant, will go head to head with Apple’s Siri, using machine learning to try to understand users’ spoken queries. Excited about joining Apple as a director of AI research in addition to my work at CMU. Apply to work with my teamhttps://t.co/U2hQl2GdhA— Russ Salakhutdinov (@rsalakhu) October 17, 2016 Salakhutdinov’s work on cutting-edge machine-learning techniques could help drive progress in AI, and it could be applied in many different areas, including computer vision, natural language processing, and even robotics. Speaking recently, Salakhutdinov said that there are three big areas where AI is progressing: giving computers better language understanding; enabling them to learn through repetition and positive reinforcement; and developing ways for machines to learn from unlabeled data. He also highlighted the work he’s doing on teaching machines to learn from unstructured data on the Web, something that could conceivably help make a product like Siri more intelligent. “We’re working on the idea of trying to use external knowledge bases,” he said. “If I ask you something about a particular thing, can your system basically go to Wikipedia, read a few different articles, learn some facts about the world, and provide you with the right answer?” Salakhutdinov’s recent work has also focused on enabling machines to learn from different sorts of data, and on ways for things learned in one context to be applied in a completely new one—areas known, respectively, as multimodal learning and transfer learning. He also collaborated on a project that showed, by taking inspiration from cognitive science, how computers can learn from relatively small amounts of data (see “This AI Algorithm Learns Simple Tasks as Fast as We Do”). In recent years, competitors such as Google and Facebook have hired leading figures in deep learning to lead their AI efforts. Apple has a much less prominent AI research effort than competitors, and some have suggested that its traditional secrecy has made it difficult for the company to recruit the best researchers in the field. Deep learning has gained prominence in recent years, after proving spectacularly good at enabling machines to recognize objects in images and spoken words in audio. Google and Facebook use the technology to automatically caption images. And it has made Siri and other voice-activated products better at recognizing words. Parsing the meaning of those words remains a grander challenge, however (see “AI’s Language Problem”). Weren't able to make it to EmTech? We've got you covered.

The 'Very Blue' version of the Pixel and Pixel XL sold out within minutes of Google making them available on the Google Store, and now the 32GB for the Pixel in Quite Black and Very Silver have estimated delivery times between 4 to 5 weeks within for standard shipping. The Pixel XL is also completely sold out. This isn’t too much of a surprise knowing how popular the phones have become, but still a bummer if you were looking to buy the Pixel or Pixel XL. Related Stories Google Pixel: 10 Reasons To Buy Pixel, Pixel XL Accidentally Leaked Ahead Of Launch Event Google’s new phones have pretty much the same specs.

Brady Dale for Observer Visa announced today that its CEO is stepping down, and he will be replaced in the role by the current CEO of Intersection, the Alphabet-owned company (in common parlance, the Google-owned company). Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. will take over as the head of the global payments company after its current chief, Charlie Scharf, steps down at the beginning of December. We’ve covered Intersection here at the Observer as the company that’s been putting up the LinkNYC wi-fi and data kiosks all over the city, firing up the first one in February. In particular, we wrote about the weird fact of its two different user agreements and the ways in which it may or may not provide a real world layer of cybersurveillance over the city. The Village Voice took a deep dive into the implications of the giant kiosks in July. This LinkNYC kiosk-to-come was recently seen on Fulton Street, near the eastern edge of Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn. Brady Dale for Observer “Under Al’s leadership, we have made tremendous progress toward capitalizing on the opportunity to transform cities and business through a unique combination of data, connectivity and media,” Dan Doctoroff, CEO of Sidewalk Labs, said in a post on Medium about the transition. Sidewalk Labs owns Intersection, within Alphabet. Doctoroff will serve as interim CEO until a new one is found. Kelly took over Intersection in February, as the Wall Street Journal reported. He previously served for many years at American Express, then joined Visa’s board in 2014, according to Visa’s release. Scharf wrote in that release, “I and our senior management team have had the opportunity to work closely with Al—and those relationships, along with his depth and breadth of payment knowledge—will enable him to step in quickly without missing a beat.” Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP

The Pixel XL's closest relative is the Huawei-manufactured, Google-overseen Nexus 6P. What are the differences between last year's well-reviewed Nexus 6P and the first phablet to bear the Google name? Size If the Pixel is XL, then the Nexus 6P is ... jumbo? The 6P is nearly 3-percent taller and wider than the Pixel, though they are of equal thickness. Both phones fall squarely in phablet territory, with big screens great for internet use and video playback, but are perhaps too large to fit comfortably in smaller hands or tote along during a workout. Weight While the Nexus is just a little bit larger, it's almost 6-percent heavier. Build Both phones are built with an aircraft-grade aluminum unibody. Pixel's take is a little more understated and minimal, with a simple "G" logo and a glossy section at the top portion of the back. The Nexus 6P is more adventurous, with a glassy black camera bump-out and prominent branding. Colors Both phones stick to the neutral/metallic color palette we're used to seeing in smartphones. The Nexus has more options, but Pixel offers a blue color, which is the most novel variant of the bunch. Water resistance Even though this year's flagships from Apple and Samsung both have water resistance ratings, these Google-spawned phones need to stay high and dry. Display size The few millimeters in extra height and width afford the Nexus a 3.5-percent larger display. Display resolution Both displays have 2,560 x 1,400 Quad HD resolution. Since the Pixel has a smaller display, its pixels are slightly more dense. Display type Both flagships choose AMOLED technology over IPS displays. Pressure-sensitive display Unlike Apple, Android manufacturers have yet to incorporate pressure-sensitive displays into their phones. Apple uses this technology to enable 3D Touch, a navigational feature that prompts different shortcuts depending on how hard you press the touchscreen. Camera megapixels Google touts the Pixel's camera as the "highest rated smartphone camera. Ever." But until we take a few test shots, it's unclear how it surpasses the very good camera in last year's Nexus 6P, with which it shares several matching specs. Camera aperture (rear) Camera aperture has a big impact on how well a smartphone is able to shoot in low light conditions. Both of these phones have a f/2.0 aperture. Although that's fairly large, it's not industry-leading. Optical image stabilization Optical image stabilization is conspicuously absent from these phones. When it comes to battling camera shake and unwanted photo blur, you'll need either an exceptionally steady hand or a stable stand to shoot from. Dual-lens camera Both of these cameras have standard single-lens rear cameras, so don't look for the kind of dual-lens engineering seen in the iPhone 7 Plus or Huawei Honor 8. Battery Although these two batteries look identical (both are a rather large 3,450 mAh size) their estimated battery life does not compare. Pixel XL users can expect up to 32 hours of talk time and up to 14 hours of internet use or video playback. On the other hand, Nexus 6P offers up to 23 hours of talk time and up to 10 hours of internet use or video playback. Clearly, battery size alone does not a long-lived smartphone make. Charging/data port Both phones use the newer, reversible USB-C port over proprietary cables like Apple's Lightning or older technology like microUSB. Fast charging According to Google, the Pixel XL will get up to seven hours of use from a 15-minute charge. Nexus 6P makes the same claim, but in 10 minutes of charging. Wireless charging Nexus has toyed with wireless charging in the past, but that feature didn't make the cut for either of these phones. Processor The Pixel XL has a newer Snapdragon chip with a higher clock speed. RAM The Pixel is also better equipped for rigorous software applications, with 4-gigabytes of RAM to the 6P's 3-gigabytes. Internal storage Both phones are available in 32- and 128-gigabyte sizes. The Nexus adds an intermediary 64-gigabyte option as well. External storage Serious Android users may be vexed to learn that neither of these devices have expandable storage. The Samsung Galaxy S7 series may be your best option if you need microSD to manage your content. VR-ready VR compatibility is one of the major differentiators between these two flagships. Thanks in part to its updated processor and ample RAM, Pixel XL is Google Daydream-ready out of the box. The Nexus 6P should not be considered Daydream-ready. This may come as a surprise, considering that the 6P is currently the only supported headset phone in the Daydream development kit. But as Google tells developers, the "6P's thermal performance is not representative of the consumer Daydream-ready phones ... expect the 6P to thermally throttle CPU and performance after a short period of use, depending on workload." Headphone jack No need to plan for a new set of earbuds or an intermediary adapter. These phones have the tried-and-true designated headphone jack. Fingerprint sensor It's safe to say that fingerprint sensors are sticking around for the foreseeable future. Both phones place theirs on the back. Home button Neither phone has a physical home button. Instead, the home buttons are onscreen, taking up a small bit of real estate at the bottom of the display. Mobile payments Both phones are NFC-equipped, so you can use Android Pay at participating retailers. Virtual assistant Google Assistant is another one of the Pixel's distinguishing characteristics. The Pixel and Pixel XL are the first phone to have this spiffed-up Siri alternative built in. From what we can tell, Google Assistant is a more ambitious version of Google Now. We'll certainly include our thoughts on Google Assistant when we post our full-length review of the Pixel in the near future. Operating system As the first Google-branded phone, the Pixel is at the forefront of Android operating system updates. It launches with Android 7.1, the absolute latest in Nougat. It is guaranteed to receive all software updates for two years and security updates for three years (from launch). Prior to Pixel, Nexus always carried the torch for Android software releases. In the near future, we expect it to continue to be ahead of the curve, even if it is a little behind the Pixels. As of now, Nexus 6P is still running 7.0 Nougat, with a 7.1 update expected near the end of the year. Release Pixels are just starting to ship now. Nexus 6P is already a year old. Starting price (full retail) Based on specs alone, these two phones are quite competitive. That's why it can be downright surprising to discover that Pixel XL is almost US$200 more than the Nexus 6P. And that's based on full retail pricing – now that the Nexus is a year old, it can easily be found at a discount. On paper, the Pixel's biggest advantages are Google Assistant, VR compatibility and a little more processing power. It may be easy to dismiss those features in favor of a little extra cash in your wallet, especially considering that when all is said and done, the Nexus 6P is an excellent phone. However, we do expect the Pixel to have some advantages that don't translate into facts and figures. Since it's the first phone to bear the Google banner, we are eager to see if it provides a hardware/software harmony that edges out other Android environments and challenges Apple's iOS walled garden. Of course, we also want to evaluate the camera with test shots instead of specs. For background reading, you can dive deeper into our reviews of the Pixel XL and Nexus 6P.

(Reuters/Stephen Lam) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong Obsession Borders October 17, 2016 Google is doubling down on its submarine cable investments in the Pacific ocean, this time with Facebook’s backing. The two tech companies announced last week (Oct. 12) that they are joining a consortium to build a new transpacific submarine cable system that will be ready in 2018. The project, known as the Pacific Light Cable Network, will be the largest-capacity transpacific link when it’s operational, with a bandwidth of 120 terabits per second. It will stretch 12,800km between Manhattan Beach, in Los Angeles, California, and Tseung Kwan O, in Hong Kong. The planned cable has double the capacity of the current largest pipe under the Pacific, the FASTER cable system, which Google also invested in. Neither Google nor Facebook disclosed the amount they are investing, but the project costs $400 million in total, according to the consortium’s other partners, TE Connectivity and China Soft Power Technology Holding, when the project was first announced (pdf) last November. The Pacific is seeing a boom in submarine-cable construction. Nearly $1.5 billion has been committed to submarine routes there between 2016 and 2018, making it among the world’s most heavily invested regions for new fiber-optic bandwidth, according to data from research firm TeleGeography (pdf). It’s part of a wider trend of internet infrastructure investment in Asia outpacing other regions. The new cable project contributes to another infrastructure trend, where content-owners like Google and Facebook increasingly build their own pathways to their end-users to cater to explosive demand for bandwidth-intensive content, such as video streams. The amount of traffic that flows over these privileged links has grown so great that it has altered the structure of the internet itself, in a phenomenon known as the “flattening” of the internet. Facebook teamed up with Microsoft in May to build a new transatlantic cable, dubbed Marea, that connects Bilbao in Spain to Virginia in the United States. Google says it’ll use the capacity from its new Hong Kong-LA cable to serve its Google Cloud Platform customers. The new bandwidth could accommodate 80 million simultaneous high-definition video calls between the two regions, the company said in a blog post. Video-heavy data links are precisely what the world’s biggest tech companies are preparing for, and why they’ll continue to own more of the internet’s infrastructure.

An Apple store in New York. Credit: Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg Most Popular The days of just selling stuff are long gone. Today, in the race for consumers, marketers need to create entire, cohesive ecosystems in order to provide the most value. Brand consultancy Interbrand recently released its 2016 Best Global Brands report, ranking the top 100 most valuable brands for the 17th time. For the fourth year in a row, Apple and Google snagged the top spots—Apple's brand value rose 5% to $178,1 million, and Google's grew 11% to $133.3 million, Interbrand found. But the report found that a big part of what makes brands like Apple valuable is their cohesiveness as a connected business system. Apple communicates with its customers through its hardware, software, and retail stores to deliver one consistent narrative or ecosystem, said Josh Feldmeth, chief executive, North America at Interbrand. Related Stories One-Fifth of Apple iOS Users Avoid Ad Targeting in Apps: Report Amazon's New Music-Streaming Service Goes Up Against Spotify, Apple A Crisis Gone to Waste: Why Samsung Shouldn't Have Canceled ANA Presentation "These companies are growing because they're building ecosystems around human beings and natural behavior—it's about adding a set of products and services that are relevant but doing it in a connected way," he said, noting that the issue has risen in importance in recent years with the increase in digital and social media. "With brands like Apple and Amazon, or any of these amazing ecosystems, the deeper you go or the longer you stay, the more value you receive as a customer, and that's how they're driving growth." Car companies are also trying to evolve their technology to offer more solutions to shoppers. Interbrand chart Credit: Interbrand According to an Interbrand chart, the most cohesive brands are Apple, Colgate, and Adobe. Google is a little less cohesive, and Xerox, is in the least cohesive realm. Mr. Feldmeth noted that being cohesive can be challenging for marketers. "In a more linear model, marketers could operate more or less independently," he said, noting they were under pressure from C-suite colleagues but that was it. Today, they need to "integrate functionally around the customer," which requires collaboration, interdisciplinary skill sets and technology fluency, he said. Interbrand found that, in addition to Apple and Google, the top five most-valuable brands included Coca Cola, Microsoft and Toyota. Tesla and Dior made the list for the first time this year.

PeopleImages.com/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption PeopleImages.com/Getty Images Author Tim Wu says that much of the content on the Internet is created by businesses that are on a "quest for clicks." PeopleImages.com/Getty Images If you feel like Internet ads are more pervasive and invasive than ever before, you're not alone. Author Tim Wu tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that the Web has gotten worse over the years, not better — and unrelenting ads are to blame. "I think you spend 50 percent of your mental energy trying to defeat ad systems," Wu says. "It's amazing that we've got this great scientific invention, the Web and the Internet, and then it has come to the point where using it reminds me of swatting mosquitoes." As a professor at Columbia Law School, Wu became known as an open Internet advocate who is credited with coining the term "net neutrality." His new book, The Attention Merchants, examines how advertising has changed the Internet — and how those changes affect us. Enlarge this image Tim Wu is a professor at Columbia Law School. His previous books include The Master Switch and Network Neutrality. Mikiko Hayashi/ Deckle Edge hide caption toggle caption Mikiko Hayashi/ Deckle Edge Tim Wu is a professor at Columbia Law School. His previous books include The Master Switch and Network Neutrality. Mikiko Hayashi/ Deckle Edge He says the book was inspired by his own experience of sitting down to look something up on the computer and finding, four hours later, that he had slid into a world of digital distraction. "It's what I call the casino effect," Wu says. "It's this effort of the environment to make you lose control of your sense of time and your attention kind of gets dragged away." Wu points out that much of the "free" content on the Internet comes at a price to users, who are subjected to ads that are targeted specifically at them and which are increasingly difficult to ignore or close. "Google, Facebook, Twitter — the whole set of companies essentially knows all your weaknesses and essentially how to manipulate you in subtle ways in order to have you do things you might not otherwise do," he says. Article continues after sponsorship Wu says that although the Internet is full of "clickbait that brings ads along like a bad cold," it doesn't have to be that way.

How? Amazon Independent Booksellers On the quest for clicks It's inherent to the business model. It's very driven with the need to grow, to get more clicks and clicks and clicks. And some of this book is about the history, and we often say that ratings kind of ruined television in the 1950s, well, the quest for ratings looks dignified in comparison to the quest for clicks. So much engineering talent and ability has gone into trying to make people click on things that I think we've almost lost the last five years of development. It's been very disappointing. On how we are used to content being free It's a bargain with some historical precedent. I think back starting with radio, starting with television, we got used to this idea of stuff being free as long as you just watch a few ads. ... This attention-merchant model has spread to so many areas of our life, where we're completely used to everything being free. But then the payoff, or the exchange, is that then we also agree to stuff that is compromised, because it is always trying to get us to click on ads at the same time. So we have this bargain that we made — and you can call it Faustian, you can call it whatever you want — that we have decided that we have to have everything for free, and I think we're starting to pay for it in terms of our mental states. On the price of "free" Internet content If you really want change in this area, and you want to act, you probably have to pay for stuff, pay for content. Some people are like, "Oh my God I have to pay?" But people do pay. They pay for Netflix, they pay for HBO, they pay for other types — they subscribe to newspapers sometimes. All Tech Considered Online Trackers Follow Our Digital Shadow By 'Fingerprinting' Browsers, Devices Generally speaking, when you pay for stuff it has more of your interests at heart. ... In other words, a lot of the websites are always serving two masters, they're both trying to get you entertained enough to stay there, or to click on things, but to also then make it a good platform for advertising. So I have sort of a plea to people who want to change these sort of things is, like, maybe just suck it up and start paying for more stuff. On the pervasiveness of Internet advertising In the media, traditional media like print, we had boundaries, we had spaces that ads didn't leave, they stayed where they were on the page, they didn't float around over the text, and we're sort of lost on the Internet. We don't have any barriers. We have a demand for growth that is insistent, and so advertising just keeps getting heavier and heavier and heavier. It doesn't have any natural limit, and we haven't found a place for the limit. On Google's approach to advertising I think Google is the most profitable attention merchant in the history of the world. ... They started a very idealistic beautiful company in many ways, but they didn't have a business model. 13.7: Cosmos And Culture Why Personalized Internet Ads Are Kind Of Creepy The most interesting thing about Google is its founders hated advertising and in fact, they wrote this paper in the '90s, saying in its appendix that any advertising-based search engine would always be corrupted and unable to serve its highest purposes, because advertising always corrupts the goal of the search engine, which is to try to give you the most important stuff, not the stuff someone paid to be there. Google is this conflicted company. I think they thought they could do this deal and keep advertising at bay, but I think year in, year out Google is starting to get worse instead of better. ... You can see it with Google Maps, you can see it with Google Directions where somehow Uber is always one of the options, and it's becoming exactly what they said was what they never wanted, which is a pay-for service where the highest bidder gets the best results. So it's kind of a cautionary tale. ... the Internet has become a series of traps where you do innocent things like give your name or address or indicate a preference — 'I like this thing' — and therefore you open yourself up to a deluge of advertising based on those stated preferences. Tim Wu I do think the best thing for companies like Google and Facebook, if they are afraid of this ethical trap of advertising, is they should start letting people pay who want to pay and avoid some of the advertising. On how advertisers can use technology to target individual "moments" I think this is going to become more intense in the coming decade as we start to carry more and more technology with us. We already have our phones, but other wearables and those technologies are going to want to know when you're deciding things and then offer some kind of input, subtle or less so, on that moment. So you know, discovering the moment: Let's say you're someone's phone and you notice that your owner is drinking coffee at certain times of the day, just very subtly indicating where the local coffee shop is, which happens to have paid whoever makes your phone, at the right moment. ... We are possibly facing little tiny bits of manipulation in all of our waking hours, if we don't have that already. On how Facebook "likes" help advertisers Every time you click on a "like" button on another site, you've told Facebook that you're doing that, and so therefore advertisers know who their fan base is. When you decide to "like" something you may feel you're innocently putting out your preferences, but actually you're delivering something of enormous value, which is indicating that you essentially like to be advertised to by this company. It's so funny that the Internet has become a series of traps where you do innocent things like give your name or address or indicate a preference — "I like this thing" — and therefore you open yourself up to a deluge of advertising based on those stated preferences. That's what you're doing, you're signaling who you are as a consumer. On what can happen when Internet companies know intimate details about individuals I'm concerned with our autonomy. ... I particularly don't like it when it's used to exploit your weaknesses or make you lose control in some ways — so it's like advertising casinos to people who have gambling problems, or just things that are too sensitive — if you have a disease and suddenly you started getting ads for cures for that disease, it's an embarrassing disease. All that kind of stuff, it just gets into that zone of autonomy or privacy where you feel a sense of freedom to be who you want to be, and I'm afraid when too many people know too much about you, it actually makes us all a lot more boring, because you're afraid to express yourself. personalized advertising online advertising Internet privacy Internet Facebook Twitter Google+ Email All Tech Considered Tech, Culture and Connection All Tech Considered Tech, Culture and Connection About All Tech Considered explores how technology is changing culture and connection.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Flights tackles travel fears: Here’s 5 other ways to fly smarter Eric Abent - Oct 17, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The holiday travel season is nearly upon us, and Google Flights is looking to make it a little less stressful. Google announced today that Flights will now let you know when prices are expected to go up for some routes and flights. This will happen when you select a specific flight – now, you’ll be presented with a new card that tells you how many days or hours you have left until the price is expected to increase, and how much the price is expected to jump. That feature should help quite a few holiday travelers relax during a usually stressful time. Google’s efforts to save you money don’t stop at specific flights, however. If you’ve selected a route but haven’t picked a flight yet, Google Flights will now attempt to give you some money saving tips, such as pointing you toward different airports of suggesting different departure days. Google Flights will now send out fare expiration and price increase alerts for tracked flights. On top of that, the new Explore tab lets you search for destinations based on a number of different filters if you’re not sure where you’d like to go. Finally, Google Searches for hotels will not only let you know when there are member discounts available on a hotel’s website, but you’ll also be able to filter results by the deals that are available. Of course, Google can only do so much when it comes to trying to make holiday travel easier. The rest is up to you. With that in mind, here are five ways you can fly smarter and ultimately make your holiday trips a lot smoother. 1. Keep your charger at the top of your carry-on Don’t be like me and think that throwing your stuff into a bag without any planning is an acceptable way to fly. Whether its a delay or a layover, the chances are high that you’ll be waiting with nothing to do at some point during your journey. When that happens, your phone or tablet will likely be what you turn to in order to pass the time, so pack your charger in your carry-on last so it’s easily accessible. 2. Don’t travel with a Samsung phone for the time being There’s currently so much worry about Galaxy Note 7 batteries igniting that the United States Department of Transportation has banned them from all flights in the US. With this ban in place, it seems a bit optimistic to expect your airline to be able to tell the difference between a Note 7 and another Samsung phone. Until the worry over the Note 7 dies down a little, it might be a good idea to leave whatever Samsung phone you’ve got at home. Planning ahead, in this regard, could save quite a bit of headache at a gate. 3. Bring a paperback book I know this a gadget website and all, but one advantage a paperback book has over your phone, tablet, or notebook is that you don’t have to charge it. For times when the outlet situation will be a little uncertain (like in a crowded terminal or on a plane), a paperback book is hard to beat. 4. Pack a change of clothes and travel-sized toiletries in your carry-on Lost luggage is just a reality of flying. If it hasn’t happened to you yet, consider yourself lucky but assume you’re living on borrowed time. When it does happen, having a change of clothes and a few other essentials in a your carry-on can take some of the edge off an otherwise very stressful situation. 5. Invest in a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones If you’re going to be making a yearly thing out of holiday traveling, buying in a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones is one of the best moves you can make. Families will be traveling a lot over the holidays, and an alarming number of them will have small children. Ditching the earbuds and getting some noise-cancelling headphones will seem like one of the best decisions you’ve ever made when you’re stuck at cruising altitude with loud, obnoxious kids.

Home Industry Companies Apple Hires Carnegie Mellon AI Academic to Push Machine Learning Apple Hires Carnegie Mellon AI Academic to Push Machine Learning Apple Inc. hired a prominent artificial intelligence researcher from Carnegie Mellon University as it seeks to regain lost ground against competitors such as Google, Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. in machine learning By: Bloomberg | Updated: October 18, 2016 2:05 AM Apple is seeking scientists with “experience in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, and/or Data Mining,” it said in the job listing. (Reuters)  Apple Inc. hired a prominent artificial intelligence researcher from Carnegie Mellon University as it seeks to regain lost ground against competitors such as Google, Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. in machine learning. Russ Salakhutdinov tweeted on Monday that he’s joining the Cupertino, California-based company as a director of AI research, in addition to his role at the university. He posted a link to an Apple job application page seeking machine learning specialists. Apple is seeking scientists with “experience in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, and/or Data Mining,” it said in the job listing. The iPhone maker has been on an acquisition spree to beef up its artificial intelligence capabilities over the past 12 months, buying at least a half-dozen startups including Seattle-based Turi Inc. Apple’s penchant for secrecy has burdened efforts to improve AI offerings and hire the best talent. That’s because researchers in the field like to publish their findings, something Apple has frowned upon in the past. Machine learning has gained mounting importance for tech companies to improve their research and enable virtual assistants such as Siri to better anticipate and predict users’ needs. Siri is competing with the Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa to become the virtual assistant of choice and the access point for users seeking online services. Salakhutdinov joined Carnegie Mellon, a respected AI research center, earlier this year after spells at the University of Toronto and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His research has been funded by Google, Microsoft and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., among others, according to his personal website at the Pittsburgh-based university. Salakhutdinov has published extensively on neural networks, a branch of AI critical for voice and image recognition technology, collaborating with top researchers from academia and Google parent Alphabet Inc.

There's still much we don't know about the latter, but we can compare the features and specs we're aware of right now, with the first real mobile VR showdown. Android phone compatibility In the long run, Daydream headsets, like the View, should have the compatibility advantage. In a year or two, we'd expect just about every major Android flagship phone to be "Daydream-ready," meaning Google thinks they're up-to-snuff for sliding inside a VR headset. At launch, though, there are only two official Daydream-ready phones: Google's own Pixel and Pixel XL. In the short term, Samsung has a big compatibility advantage – with all of the company's 2015-16 flagships (six phones in total) in the mix. The Gear VR only plays nice with Samsung Galaxy flagships. It's always possible Samsung and Oculus will open that up to Android at large at some point, but we've yet to hear anything on that front. After the damage done to the Galaxy brand from the exploding Note 7 debacle, will Gear VR have lost some of its luster too? Is this a prime opportunity for Google to step in? Time will tell. iPhone compatibility Neither headset works with iPhones. If Apple ever releases a mobile VR headset, it will likely leap to the head of the pack almost immediately, as far as adoption goes. Build It isn't often you see a tech product where build materials are its killer feature, but that's the case with the ultra-sleek, fabric-covered Daydream View. Weight The Gear VR is 57 percent heavier, only accentuating View's sleek/light design. We never found the Gear's weight, though, to be anything to worry about. Both measurements are without a phone inside, but note that the Gear gets a smidge lighter if you take the front cover off. Colors The slate-colored Daydream View (pictured) will be the only option at launch, but at some point later this year Google will offer the headset in two more hues. Display resolution Display resolution, of course, comes from the phone inside. All of the Gear VR-ready Galaxy phones have ultra-high QHD resolution. Between the two Daydream-friendly phones at launch, one is QHD (Google Pixel XL) and the other a mere 1080p (Pixel), which won't look quite as crisp through the lenses. Display type AMOLED display panels are practically necessary for high-quality VR, due to their low persistence and deep blacks. Field of view Google hasn't released any field of view specs for Daydream View, but it should be lower than the Gear VR's (possibly by a wide margin). In both headsets, the FOV will also be a little smaller if you use a phone with a smaller screen inside (Galaxy S7, S6, Pixel) as opposed to a phablet (Galaxy S7 edge, S6 edge+, Note 5, Pixel XL). Motion controller It's a far cry from Oculus Touch or the Vive's controllers, but Google is including a single motion-control remote with Daydream View. Without a pair of controllers, though, it's going to be less about making you feel like you have hands in the virtual worlds, and more about simple actions like pointing a virtual gun or magic wand, or menu navigation. Gamepad support Google is pushing its remote control as the primary input for Daydream View, and a Google rep tells us Daydream games won't support full gamepads as an alternative. The Gear VR does support a Bluetooth gamepad (sold separately). Touchpad The Gear VR also has a touchpad on the right side of the headset, as an alternate control method in some of its simpler games. Positional tracking This is still mobile VR's biggest weakness, compared to PC-based stuff like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Samsung's and Google's headsets only track head rotation, not neck-down movement of any kind. So when you move or lean your body, the virtual world moves or leans with you – a strange sensation that reminds you how entry-level today's mobile VR is. Wireless Conversely, this is mobile VR's biggest advantage over PC- and console-based virtual reality. Since it isn't connected to anything, pulling all its power from the smartphone living under its lid, it's completely wireless. Ports Daydream View is looking forward with USB-C, which is slowly pushing Android's old microUSB connectors out of the picture. The latest Gear VR can switch between the two, thanks to detachable adapters, but after the Note 7 recall there are no remaining compatible USB-C phones for the Gear (next year's Galaxy S8 will likely bring it back to relevance). Focus adjustment The Gear VR has a handy wheel on top that lets you tweak its focus to match your vision, not unlike a machine you'd get tested on at your local optometrist's office. Glasses support You can wear glasses underneath both headsets, but the Gear's focus wheel means specs-wearers can just take them off for use with Samsung's headset. Software At least in the short term, this is the biggest thing Gear VR can hang its hat on. With help from Oculus and its legion of VR developers (the Gear VR gets content exclusively from the Oculus Store that pre-installs when you first use the headset), it has by far today's biggest and best selection of mobile virtual reality content. Daydream requires Android Nougat. As far as content goes, it essentially inherits two years' worth of Google Cardboard apps and games – generally solid but not Oculus Store level – along with new stuff timed to launch alongside Google's consumer-friendly Daydream platform. Release This latest version of the Gear VR launched alongside the ill-fated Note 7 in early August, but, with that phone going up in flames, all the same phones now work with the original Gear VR that launched in late 2015. Daydream View will be shipping sometime in November. Price Daydream View is US$20 cheaper and also includes its nifty little remote. If you own a compatible Samsung phone and want to save some money, though, you can find last-gen Gear VR headsets for cheaper than the View.

Google Flights Will Now Alert Users When Airfares Are About To Expire Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Flights Will Now Alert Users When Airfares Are About To Expire October 17, 2016 1:47 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk going... going... gone up up and away Google Flights google airfare airlines travel When you spot an enticing airfare online, it can be hard to walk away from it, only to find when you return even just a day later that the price has skyrocketed. Google Flights is attempting to help travelers avoid that from happening with a new system that notifies them when a good deal on airfare is about to disappear. Some flight apps and booking sites might let users know whether airfares are expected to fluctuate, but Google Flights will notify folks when a particular price is going to expire, triggering a fare increase. “After selecting a specific flight, a notification may appear letting you know when the current fare is expected to expire and how much you can save if you book now,” Google explains, giving the example of a flight to San Diego that will likely cost more in eight hours, saving a traveler $87 if they book before then. If you’re not ready to book at that moment, you can instead track the flight or route and get notifications via email alerting you when prices are expected to change. The new fare expiration and expected price jump notifications features will be rolling out over the coming weeks everywhere Google Flights is available, the company says, adding that users will “also continue to receive updates when prices actually do increase or decrease significantly for tracked flights.” October 17, 2016 By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk going... going... gone up up and away Google Flights google airfare airlines travel Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related discountapalooza Airfare Deals Popping Up In Some Cities As Airlines Try To Fill More Seats we'll let this one slide American Airlines Will Honor Super Low “Mistake Fares” That Discounted Flights Up To 90% (UPDATE) More Money For Souvenirs Early Birds Beware: Buying Tickets To Europe Too Far In Advance Could Cost You looking at the costs The Hidden Rewards Miles Charge You Should Know About what's the catch?

SUBSCRIBE Dear Google, how about OS targeting? Programmatic search? In light of the recent updates to device bidding in AdWords, columnist Kevin Lee suggests ways in which Google might build on these changes to make the platform even more valuable to advertisers. Kevin Lee on October 17, 2016 at 11:31 am More Hey, Google — thanks for giving us bid modifiers for tablets and smartphones (mobile devices with full browsers). It’s great that we can once again set bids intelligently based on the data around the relative value of the searcher and the relative relevance of our offer to the searcher. Make no mistake: returning this measure of control to us is a huge deal. For many advertisers — particularly larger ones spending in excess of $100,000 per month — it’s well worth the hassle to calculate and re-calculate the bid modifiers by device type. I’m guessing you knew already that larger advertisers like extra control (because they have data sets large enough to mine information about bid modifiers). Of course, you also know that this will increase yields (you’ll make more revenue per SERP [search engine results page]), so it’s a win-win. Plus, many of the more sophisticated marketers also use bid modifiers based on location, time of day and audience. Here’s the problem, Google. I don’t think you went far enough. So please hear two additional, modest requests on behalf of the marketers buying clicks from you. 1. Please bring back operating system (OS) as an additional bid modifier With operating system available as a bid modifier, device control won’t be needed. Why? Because there are major situational differences between the smartphone, tablet and desktop searchers — and that’s just the beginning of audience differentiators. For tablet, smartphone or desktop, audience differences are often characterized as being due to where the search is located in the “buying funnel” (which is a bit of an over-simplification, even if the buying funnel still exists in its original form). For many marketers, the differences by operating system are far more useful given that the demographics and psychographics of iOS smartphone or tablet users vary quite significantly from those of Android smartphone or tablet users. For example, at my company, before the implementation of Enhanced Campaigns, we could target both by OS and device (before there were hundreds of choices). For some of our largest advertisers, we cloned high-volume ad groups into two separate campaigns (since bid boosts weren’t available) and set bids separately by OS. The bid management system almost always bid more for iOS than Android because conversion rates and — in retail — average shopping cart sizes were larger. So Google, please consider returning this targeting lever to us. 2. Real-time bidding (RTB) for SEM (search engine marketing) With header bidding and the launch of “native” ad formats within programmatic media, now may be the time to revisit SEM as an RTB (Real-Time Bidding)-based marketplace. We understand that fast SERPs are really important; several years ago, the lag time in programmatic display was far too long to seriously consider RTB. But a lot has changed in the last five years, even within AdX. With RTB for native ad formats, advertisers — though their DSPs (demand-side platforms)– could use any targeting you provided (e.g., keyword, geography) and combine that with both first- and third-party data to make the most informed choices about bids. Not ready to make a change of that magnitude? Then why not create a new ad unit in the SERP, particularly in desktop, where the percentage of white space is huge (especially after your right rail elimination earlier this year). There are several things Google could do on desktop and tablet SERPs that would monetize that space, with all sorts of fun ad formats that consumers would also love (or at least tolerate). After all, Google still uses that space for entertainment and travel queries, for example: https://www.google.com/search?num=50&q=lady+gaga (Tickets, music) https://www.google.com/search?num=50&q=thailand+beaches (Google is innovating in travel, and this right rail space is especially valuable in a travel context.) https://www.google.com/search?num=50&q=star+wars+the+force+awakens (I can imagine a trailer video link that the movie studio would gladly sponsor.) My guess  is that Google might well be thinking about video ads, carousel ads, and perhaps even ghosted brand backgrounds as candidates to appear in that white space. More control for advertisers is key Advertisers will appreciate getting as much control as you can give them. After all, access to each and every one of the segmentation levers is something all search marketing teams should at least think about. Do the analysis and you might be surprised: when the device type bid modifiers are combined with location, time-of-day and audience, you’ll have a lot of control over who sees your ads in their SERPs. Of course, not all surfers and searchers are equally important. As a marketer, all you need to do is know where to look for the data, and you can confirm that fact. Your business intelligence data will likely tell you that you have a “Pareto Distribution” (otherwise known as the 80-20 rule or “Power Law”) when you measure the value of all your customers based on many different segment comparisons.  The same holds true when you buy media. How do we justify this extra hassle in analysis mathematically? Well, think of it this way: many marketers are given a fixed budget and some marketing KPIs to hit (conversions, calls, store visits, sales ans so on). With a fixed budget, you always want to buy the most valuable clicks (as defined by your KPIs), and as budget increases, you’ll find that the new clicks you’re buying (if you focused on the best clicks first) have a lower value to you. But by adding additional targeting levers, you have an opportunity to cherry-pick the best from any audience. The bigger you are as a marketer, the faster you can accumulate data about the various targeting segments (device type, location, time of day and audience) and apply this data toward your campaigns.

SUBSCRIBE What are Google’s Gary Illyes’ favorite ranking signals? Gary Illyes from Google loves Penguin, Panda and localization algorithms. Barry Schwartz on October 17, 2016 at 10:06 am More Ever wonder which algorithms Googlers themselves love? We asked Google’s Gary Illyes that question in part two of our interview with the search quality analyst. Gary told us his favorite algorithms to date are Penguin, Panda and the localization project he worked on in the past. He said he loved Panda because “people found very interesting ways to try to game our ranking algorithms and Panda figured out how to deal with those weird things.” He also enjoyed the localization project because he speaks “several languages,” and especially with Japanese, Chinese or Korean, where the language and queries can have no spaces, it provides an interesting challenge. He said: I speak several languages working with that, with the language team for example was really really really cool. There are tons of languages where for example where you don’t have space and that the concept of space in the language, like Japanese or Chinese or Korean. And when people type these like sentences or these super long phrases in the search box and then you have to figure out for example how to segment those because our indexing algorithm is working based on tokens not like cool phrases. That that was really really fascinating. I thought super interesting. But right now, Penguin is his favorite algorithm because of how it devalues over demotes. Here is the audio snippet: Here is the transcript: Danny Sullivan: Gary, what’s your favorite signal? Gary Illyes: Favorite signal? Danny Sullivan: Yeah. No, your favorite signal for ranking? Gary Illyes: Oh, for ranking. Danny Sullivan: Oh, you got 200. Just give us one. Give us one unusual, weird signal that nobody knows about. You can totally tell us; nobody would care. Not going to ruin anything. Just one good signal. Gary Illyes: I worked on local or localization. Basically ranking different in different countries and based on and based on the language. And that was really fascinating. I speak several languages working with that, with the language team for example was really really really cool. There are tons of languages where for example where you don’t have space and that the concept of space in the language, like Japanese or Chinese or Korean. And when people type these like sentences or these super long phrases in the search box and then you have to figure out for example how to segment those because our indexing algorithm is working based on tokens not like cool phrases. That that was really really fascinating. I thought super interesting. Danny Sullivan: That’s cool. Gary Illyes: But it wasn’t the secret. I think we already said that we didn’t say we use language Panda. But I will tell you why. I really like the Panda algorithm or Panda signal because people found very interesting ways to try to game our ranking algorithms and Panda figured out how to deal with those weird things. So that’s also great. And now Penguin, Penguin is probably now the most favorite. Note: This article was prewritten and scheduled to be published today.

SUBSCRIBE Hermit Crab SEO You've heard of Barnacle SEO, but what about Hermit Crab SEO? Columnist Bryson Meunier sheds some light on this troubling black hat practice and urges search engines to do something about it. Bryson Meunier on October 17, 2016 at 11:00 am More You may remember the hermit crab as the animal that uses the shells of other animals for its own survival. Because hermit crabs require larger and larger shells as they grow, they compete with other hermit crabs for discarded shells. This is what I see happening in search results lately in my own niche. Hermit Crab SEO is similar to Barnacle SEO — a term coined by Search Influence’s Will Scott to describe using the rankings of a larger object to help your site’s search visibility. But it’s different in that it is not using a larger site’s rankings, but using a defunct larger site’s authority (the shell) and creating rankings for your content (the crab) by adopting the larger site as a home — making their authoritative site relevant to what you’re trying to sell. I’m not involved in any of these Hermit Crab SEO relationships, but there are likely variations on how it occurs — the smaller site may buy the one with more authority and move in, or the larger site may sell space to the smaller one, renting it a room in its shell. Instinctively, this strikes me as somewhat unfair, as it amounts to “pay for play” and allows smaller brands to get traffic from search results without actually earning links, but rather by paying for someone else’s links to boost their own visibility. It’s similar to what black hats do with private blog networks (PBNs), buying up once popular domains in order to link to content they want to rank. This is a clearly black hat practice that I wouldn’t recommend to marketers looking for sustainable traffic, because Google is aware of a lot of PBNs and has disabled them and spoken publicly against the practice. What’s different about this is that I reported it to Google months ago at the highest levels, and the sites in question still rank. Until they stop ranking or Google speaks out against the practice publicly, some may consider that a tacit approval of the practice and recreate it for themselves. Today, the rankings of the example site below have only improved in the past two years, even though none of the links to the site are for the content that’s currently hosted there. The tale of Excite.com Remember Excite.com? Excite launched a search engine three years before Google, in October 1995. This got them a lot of attention and links at the time — so much so that even today, in 2016, they can boast a Domain Authority of 89, according to Moz. (They’re most famous for refusing to buy Google for $750,000 back in 1999.) If you go to the site today, you’ll find a similar collection of links on the home page to what was there back in 1998, with two notable exceptions. Six years ago, in March of 2010, they copied a small-ticket company called TicketsMate and hosted their content on the excite.com domain. (Disclosure: my employer, VividSeats, is a competitor to TicketsMate.) Figure 1: Ticketsmate site on Ticketsmate.com Figure 2: Ticketsmate.com copied on Excite.com Clearly, there’s no duplicate content “penalty” at work here. In May of 2010, they launched the Excite Education Portal, where they use the site’s domain authority to rank well for online education terms and drive leads to online schools. Today, 97 percent of the keywords that Excite.com ranks for organically in Google are related to either tickets (77 percent) or online education (20 percent) according to SEMRush data. Fewer than one percent of the keywords they rank for are navigational, or people looking to go to Excite.com. However, in contrast, very few of their links are to tickets or education pages, and 94 percent of their links are to their home page. Furthermore, most of the links to their ticket and education pages fall in one of three categories: They were acquired in late 2014, when many sites in the ticket industry were hit by an Xrumer comment spam attack. They are the result of low-quality sites scraping Google that everyone gets. They are low-quality directory links or links from low-authority sites, some of which have anchor text that doesn’t match the content, like this link to their Super Bowl page from the seminal 2014 article “Questioning About Soccer? Go by means of These Valuable Guidelines” with the anchor text “obama student loan forgiveness after 10 years”: Very few of Excite’s inbound links are legitimate sites that point to them as a good site to buy tickets or get education information from. And yet they rank very well for these things. If you have ever doubted that the concept of site authority is important for SEO, this should convince you otherwise. At least in this niche (as well as online education and home security), the total number of quality links to the site, rather than to the pages, seems to determine whether the pages rank. Is this a legitimate SEO practice that you should employ? Google didn’t respond to our request for comment at press time, but if it’s not outright spam, it does seem to fly in the face of the concept of creating valuable content. According to Google’s help section, The key to creating a great website is to create the best possible experience for your audience with original and high quality content. If people find your site useful and unique, they may come back again or link to your content on their own websites. This can help attract more people to your site over time. But why go through the difficult process of creating valuable content that organically attracts links when you can, in fact, use someone else’s site authority to rank content people don’t otherwise care about, and will not search for or link to? After all, it’s much easier (as long as Google makes it possible) to visit the Internet graveyard and find a once-great partner with old links and high domain authority that you can make rank for competitive content that your own domain would have no hope at all at ranking for. What can Google do? If Google wanted to defuse this, it would be easy enough to do. It becomes pretty clear which sites are legitimate authorities in an industry when you measure the percentage of linking root domains to their home page relative to other pages on the site. When I looked at a sample of sites in the ticket industry, the top three sites had an average of 37 percent of their links to their home page, and searches on their brand terms plus the content they want to rank for (e.g., “stubhub red sox tickets”). Google even has patents for the last part of this, but they’re clearly not using it to determine site quality here. I’m not pretending I don’t know how difficult it is to weed out spam in an industry where paid links, or links due to paid partnerships, would exist even without search engines. I know it’s tough. I’m also not blaming Excite or TicketsMate, as they’re just making money on a strategy that clearly works for them. But any company with machine learning, self-driving cars and the smartest engineers on the planet should be able to figure out that a site with an extremely high percentage of links to their home page probably doesn’t deserve to be there. Especially if they keep telling us that creating good content that generates organic links is the best SEO. But until they do, grab a discarded shell of a website, and walk like a crab to the bank.

Industry Google: 8,000 mile long undersea Internet cable to connect LA to Hong Kong By Stefen Marwa - October 16, 2016 0 189 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) is the latest attempt by Google, Facebook and TE SubCom to provide ultra-fast intercontinental Internet connection between Lost Angeles and Hong Kong through a 8,000 mile long undersea Internet cable. Google and Facebook have major plans for the PLCN as this connection between Asia and North America will ease out traffic congestion and provide massive bandwidths in tune of 120 Tbps, making it the highest-capacity trans-Pacific route, a record currently held by another Google-backed cable system, FASTER. Details revealed by Google indicate that the 12,800 km of fiber will enable 80 million concurrent HD video conference calls between Hong Kong and LA. This is the sixth submarine cable in which Google has an ownership stake — joining the ranks of the Unity, SJC, FASTER, MONET and Tannat projects. Google anticipates that the PLCN will be operational in 2018.   In a blog post, Google has revealed some of its plans about the new Internet cable that will be the first direct submarine cable system between Los Angeles and Hong Kong with ultra high-capacity. From the get-go, PLCN is designed to accommodate evolving infrastructure technology, allowing Google to independently choose network equipment and refresh optical technology as it advances. Most importantly, PLCN will bring lower latency, more security and greater bandwidth to Google users in the APAC region. In addition to Google’s existing investments in APAC cloud regions and the FASTER cable system, PLCN expands their ability to serve people in Asia, including Google Cloud and G Suite customers.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share John Divine Oct 17th 2016 11:46AM The Galaxy Note 7: A Product up in Flames The Samsung Galaxy Note 7, the Korean electronics company's newest smartphone, was supposed to be Samsung's answer to Apple Inc's (ticker: AAPL) iPhone 7. A blockbuster product. But those plans went up in flames just like the phone itself ... and like the replacement phones that were supposed to be less combustible. Now the company is telling Galaxy Note 7 owners to turn off their phones and send them back in a fireproof box via ground mail, just in case, and Samsung has stopped selling and producing the handset altogether. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 joins the following legendary failures as one of the worst product flops of all time. Ford Edsel One of the most famous product flops ever, the Ford Motor Co. (F) Edsel was a heavily marketed hunk of metal that Ford had big plans for. If those plans were measured in dollars, you'd have seen 400 million of them invested in the project. Some Edsels did sell, but not nearly enough: Ford lost $250 million – in 1958 dollars – on the project. The car, which was supposed to take the auto industry by storm, had a poorly defined niche and an overblown marketing campaign. Projections called for the model year 1958 Edsel to sell 200,000 models. Instead, it sold 64,000 units and was out of production by 1959. Google Glass It almost seems like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) co-founder Sergey Brin ripped the description of this product from the pages of a sci-fi novel, took it to his top engineers and said: "Make this. We'll figure out the details later." The Google Glass, introduced in 2011, was a head-mounted, internet-connected display. Essentially, it looked vaguely like glasses but was really a tiny, voice-activated computer, screen, and video camera. Due partly to the inescapable and arguably painfully foreseeable privacy concerns that followed its release, the $1,500 poorly selling gadget was taken off the market in 2015. Google (now called Alphabet) still claims new iterations of the Glass are forthcoming, but today it looks like a failed product.

(KO) saw its market share steadily dwindle at the hands of PepsiCo (PEP) for more than three decades after World War II, and the company's top brass thought the time was nigh to change the taste of its flagship product. Then-CEO Roberto Goizueta thought the answer was "New Coke or no Coke," and in April 1983 Coca-Cola changed the formula of its iconic soft drink, which became much sweeter than the original. Shortly thereafter protests erupted and some of the company's own bottlers were on the verge of boycotts; Coca-Cola was forced by the market to reintroduce the original once more, and sales soared past previous levels. Microsoft Zune Apple changed the music business forever in 2001, launching both iTunes and the iPod. It took Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) five years – an eternity in the world of consumer electronics – to respond with its own line of Zune MP3 players in November 2006. Within 18 months it would sell 2 million of them. If that sounds like a huge success, it's not; by the end of 2007, Apple had sold 141 million iPods and over 3 billion songs on iTunes. The Zune is widely considered to be a laughable, late and inferior imitation of a hit product, which is why it goes down as one of the worst product flops ever. WOW! Chips While the sweet taste of Pepsi may have forced Coca-Cola to briefly abandon (and then bring back) their flagship soda, PepsiCo's WOW! chips forced consumers to do something else entirely. Frito-Lay, a division of Pepsi, introduced WOW! chips to the public in 1998, branding them as healthier potato chips due to their low fat and caloric content. Alas, if it seems too good to be true it probably is: The "healthy" chips used fat-substitute Olestra, which has unfortunate side effects like diarrhea and incontinence. Sales quickly went down the drain and the product was renamed Light in 2004. Trump Steaks Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney gave a televised speech in March urging Americans not to vote for Donald Trump in the primaries. One of the many reasons he cited for not voting for Trump was the candidate's claim to be a masterful businessman. Romney pointed to a number of failed Trump endeavors, including Trump Steaks, as evidence to the contrary. Trump Steaks debuted in 2007 in a promotion with Sharper Image, and were briefly hawked that same year on QVC. Both deals ended shortly thereafter. The boxes of steak ranged from $199 to $999, depending on the quantity, and the trademark for Trump Steaks was canceled in December 2014. Bad! Apple Lisa Success is impossible without trial and error, and when Apple's Lisa came out in 1983, it was an undeniable error. Although the Apple Lisa was one of the first computers to have a graphical user interface, it was also one of Apple's most notorious commercial failures. The machine retailed for $9,995 ($23,962 in 2016 dollars), putting it way out of range for individuals and even largely pricing it out of the business market it was aiming for. To add insult to injury, the 1983 release was followed by 1984's Macintosh, which came with a mouse and retailed for $2,495, cannibalizing Lisa's already poor sales.

Additional AR hardware is not required to use "Maps AR," which renders info in an overlay above the iPhone camera's real-time video feed.More Google Maps is the veritable Swiss Army knife of mobile navigation. It provides directions to pretty much any place imaginable, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. It lets you store mapping data offline, highlight nearby areas of interest, organize the places you visit into lists, and even edit mapping information to improve its accuracy. Just a few short weeks ago, Google Maps gained another feature: a new screen, “Traffic Nearby,” that shows traffic conditions based on current location. And soon, it will gain two more features: a shortcut to the aforementioned traffic view, and a real-time “busyness view.” The traffic view shortcut, which isn’t yet available on iOS just yet, is straightforward. It lives on Android’s default widget list — on most devices, pressing and holding on the home screen surfaces will surface it the quickest, but Map notifications about traffic now include an option to add the shortcut. It takes the form of a circular blue-and-white icon, and does what you’d expect: tapping it launches the Traffic view within Maps for your location. Related: The future of the smart assistant is in Maps, according to Google Perhaps more exciting is functionality that has yet to be launched: a means of judging the “busyness” of a given venue in real time. In July 2015, Google rolled out “Popular Times,” a feature which estimates the popularity of restaurants, businesses, theaters, and other nearby locations on an hourly, daily, and weekly basis. It has worked in the past by passively querying the GPS location signals and Wi-Fi of users with Google Maps installed, but Android Police discovered evidence of a real-time mode. In future versions of Maps, you might be able to see just how a concert’s affecting the busyness of the local auditorium, for example, or whether or not the latest summer blockbuster is impacting attendance at a multiplex. Based on Android Police’s digging, “real-time busyness” will likely appear as a new filter in Google search. When you type in the name of a business, you’ll see not only the familiar “Popular Times” tab, but a new “Live” option; if there’s enough data for the location in question, you’ll get a measure of the spot’s busyness over the past two hours. A screenshot of the reported interface emerged earlier this year, but it’s unclear whether or not the view in Maps will adopt the same design. Related: Google Maps for iOS just got even better The new Traffic shortcut has begun rolling out to Google Maps users enrolled in the Android beta program. The real-time busyness view may take a bit longer — Android Police wasn’t able to uncover more than a few lines of code, indicating it’s a feature very much in progress. In an interview with Business Insider, Jen Fitzpatrick characterized Google Maps as “an important factor” in creating the digital assistant of the future — the next generation of Maps, Fitzpatrick said, will have a much more detailed “understanding of the world,” put more emphasis on the “individual user’s past experiences at specific locations,” and incorporate things like natural disasters and emergency services.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents FTC says it may be unable to regulate Comcast, Google, and Verizon FTC seeks to reverse AT&T ruling that may gut consumer protection authority. by Jon Brodkin - Oct 17, 2016 5:54 pm UTC Login to bookmark 54 A Comcast service vehicle. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The Federal Trade Commission is worried that it may no longer be able to regulate companies such as Comcast, Google, and Verizon unless a recent court ruling is overturned. The FTC on Thursday petitioned the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals for a rehearing in a case involving AT&T’s throttling of unlimited data plans. A 9th Circuit panel previously ruled that the FTC cannot punish AT&T, and the decision raises questions about the FTC’s ability to regulate any company that operates a common carrier business such as telephone or Internet service. While the FTC's charter from Congress prohibits it from regulating common carriers, the agency has previously exercised authority to regulate these companies when they offer non-common carrier services. But the recent court ruling said that AT&T is immune from FTC oversight entirely, even when it’s not acting as a common carrier. It isn’t clear whether the ruling sets an ironclad precedent preventing the FTC from regulating any company with a common carrier business. But the FTC’s petition for a rehearing (full text) describes that outcome as a real possibility. The FTC wrote: The panel’s ruling creates an enforcement gap that would leave no federal agency able to protect millions of consumers across the country from unfair or deceptive practices or obtain redress on their behalf. Many companies provide both common-carrier and non-common-carrier services—not just telephone companies like AT&T, but also cable companies like Comcast, technology companies like Google, and energy companies like ExxonMobil (which operate common carrier oil pipelines). Companies that are not common carriers today may gain that status by offering new services or through corporate acquisitions. For example, AOL and Yahoo, which are not common carriers, are (or soon will be) owned by Verizon. The panel’s ruling calls into question the FTC’s ability to protect consumers from unlawful practices by such companies in any of their lines of business. The Federal Communications Commission regulates common carriers such as landline and mobile phone companies and Internet service providers, "but it lacks authority over other products or services, such as e-mail and e-commerce" and doesn't have the FTC's authority to seek refunds for consumers, the petition said. The FCC's recent decision to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers increases the potential impact of the AT&T ruling, the FTC argued. "For example, Comcast, the nation’s largest cable provider (and the owner of NBCUniversal), is now a common carrier because it provides broadband service," the FTC said. "Technology giant Google, which runs a variety of businesses, provides common-carrier broadband service through its Google Fiber subsidiary. Dish Network, a satellite television provider, also provides satellite broadband. All these companies have been subject to FTC enforcement actions—Google four times since 2011—but may now seek to shield all of their conduct from consumer protection enforcement." The "enforcement gap" could be particularly severe in data privacy and security. "The FTC is the nation’s primary protector of consumer data privacy, but under the panel’s ruling it could be powerless against any company that provides a common-carrier service," the FTC said. "Consumers would have no protection from breach or misuse of their personal information or practices like false advertising or improper billing." The ruling that went against the FTC (full text) was issued by a panel of three judges. The FTC's petition last week seeks an en banc hearing in front of 11 judges; if that fails, the FTC can appeal to the US Supreme Court. The FTC argues that the appeals court panel ruling conflicts with prior decisions of the 9th Circuit and other appeal courts. "This Court has held that the same company may be a common carrier 'in some instances but not in others, depending on the nature of the activity which is subject to scrutiny,'" the FTC said. The commission also argued that the FTC Act of 1914 was passed at a time when "common carrier" clearly referred to the activity of a company and not the company's overall status. FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez has also argued that Congress should remove the common carrier exemption, saying that it is an outdated relic from an era when telecommunications companies were highly regulated monopolies that didn't also own a variety of unrelated services.

We look at the 4 key players in the market at the moment Sharing Options Share on Facebook Share Twitter Plus one on Google Plus Save on Stumble Upon Pin on Pintrest Share on Reddit By Steve Jenkins By Steve Jenkins in News 4 weeks ago GOOGLE With Cardboard, Google has put VR into the hands of thousands of developers in a cheap, accessible form factor. Up next, we have Google Daydream, a whole new platform for creating compelling WebVR experiences It’s easy to forget with devices like the Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR and a whole plethora of devices being announced, seemingly by the day, that virtual reality is not a new technology. As noted earlier, the ideas and technologies behind VR are decades old, but only now do we have enough computing power for a small enough price that we can create and deliver quality VR experiences to users almost everywhere. One of the greatest enablers of modern VR technology is the Google Cardboard headset. With its Cardboard programme, Google has put VR into the hands of practically any smartphone owner for only a few pounds. Powered by the web and by native apps alike, Cardboard has enabled parties curious about making VR experiences to try out and share their ideas without having to spend hundreds of pounds on a development kit, greatly advancing interest and innovation in the field. So what next? Now that consumers are familiar with virtual reality as a concept and an experience, Google is upping its game with its new Daydream platform. Where cardboard was designed with short demonstration pieces in mind, Daydream is designed for users to dwell for hours, not minutes. It’s still powered by your phone, but with more comfortable headsets, lower-level APIs and a brand-new controller, Google-powered VR looks set to become a prominent player in the near future. MOZILLA Mozilla has turned its collective hand to creating tools and resources with the aim of making the web the most compelling platform to build VR experiences As Mozilla has been a driving force for the latest and greatest web technologies for almost 15 years, it’s no surprise that this community-based collective has also turned its gaze to VR. What Mozilla lacks in hardware capability, it more than makes up for in its ability to produce compelling web technologies and tools. The latest of these endeavours is Mozilla’s A-Frame library. A-Frame makes it much simpler for us to construct and control a WebVR 3D scene. Instead of having to create and manage objects in JavaScript, A-Frame will enable you to create scenes and resources for the scenes with custom DOM elements. Powered by three.js, A-Frame is designed to be a simple introduction to WebVR creation, but it is also entirely capable of tapping into the raw power WebVR’s underlying technologies. As such, A-Frame has an ever-growing collection of libraries and components that can plug straight into A-Frame’s operation to provide expanded functionality with little effort. This is all while still powered by the DOM. Mozilla is also a key player in the W3C, and has been working with the standards body to create a unified interface for WebVR across the multitude of browsers that support the technology. W3C With the emergence of WebGL, WebVR and other tech, the W3C is all over standardising the interfaces and APIs, enabling users of browsers everywhere to enjoy the same compelling experiences Since the inception of the web, the W3C has been the driving force behind standardising the interfaces and APIs of the web and its technologies. WebVR is no different. WebVR began as an experimental build running VR experiences but ever since then, browser vendors have been working on providing the latest tools to enable developers to build and deploy VR experiences on the web, whilst simultaneously optimising the performance of the 3D rendering engines of their browsers. Naturally, the W3C has worked to standardise the interfaces and technologies that each browser vendor has created to enable cross-browser compatibility of WebVR experiences. The culmination of this effort is the WebVR API 1.0. Though it’s not quite ready to be adopted, as a standard, by publishing an editor’s draft and forming a community group within the W3C, WebVR is well on its way to becoming a fully fledged W3C spec. With that in mind, the W3C is open to ideas and contributions from everybody, so, if you think you’d like to make a contribution to the future of VR on the web, the W3C discussion boards and mailing lists are always open! Some of the sticking points right now include the user-flow problems and security concerns, such as ‘Should WebVR be HTTPS only?’. If you have an opinion, you need only make the case. SAMSUNG Samsung has invested significant time, resources and money in trying to become the face and provider of popular VR experiences With the new Samsung 4 browser and great kit like the Gear VR, Samsung is intent on becoming the leading force behind WebVR production and consumption. Powered by Samsung devices, and with a little help from the talented people of Oculus Rift, the Gear VR has an affinity with Cardboard-enabled devices, but with much closer integration of hardware and software that only a producer of both can offer. As such, the experiences provided are of a significantly finer quality than those viewed with the Gears recyclable counterparts. The Samsung 4 browser takes further advantage of this hardware integration. Not only can you engage with WebVR-powered experiences, but you can load conventional web-based experiences to enjoy too! Consuming HTML5 video on a screen the size of an IMAX theatre is great fun!

Next: Whatsapp’s Jan Koum says privacy won’t suffer with Facebook acquisition by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Google is in hot water for scanning millions of students’ email messages and allegedly building “surreptitious” profiles to target advertising at them. According to Education Week, a “potentially explosive” lawsuit is wending its way through US federal court, now being heard in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. In court filings, plaintiffs charge that Google data-mines Gmail users – a group that includes students who use the company’s Apps for Education tool suite. Of course it’s not news that Google reads the emails in its users’ inboxes. The consumer Gmail product is free and pays its way with targeted advertising. The targeting is done by building up profiles of users’ interests based on the content of their email. The situation is a little muddier when it comes to Apps for Education. Apps for Education is used by K-12 schools and institutions of higher education throughout the world for free online applications such as email, calendar, word processing, spreadsheet and collaborative document sharing. Google admitted to Education Week that it automatically “scans and indexes” the email of Apps for Education users even though ads are off by default. A company spokeswoman said that Google does so in order to provide features such as virus protection, spelling checks, and Gmail’s “priority inbox”. She also said that Google doesn’t process information stored in Google Drive, Docs, or other applications in Apps for Education. Its automated processes can’t actually be turned off, Google said, even for users who choose not to receive ads. The company wouldn’t say whether the scans are used to build user profiles, but Bram Bout, the director of Google Apps for Education, said in a statement that the education suite’s ads are turned off by default: ...ads in Gmail are turned off by default for Google Apps for Education and we have no plans to change that in the future. The thing is, Google’s own court filings in the California suit contradict Bout’s assertion that his employer doesn’t use data mining to target ads to Apps for Education users unless they opt to receive them, according to student-data-privacy experts, Education Week reports. Khaliah Barnes, a lawyer with the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), told the education news outlet that the case is troubling: This should draw the attention of the U.S. Department of Education, the Federal Trade Commission, and state legislatures. ... Student privacy is under attack. Nine plaintiffs, including two students who’ve used the suite, are accusing Google of violating federal and state anti-wiretapping law and hope to turn the case into a class action suit. The plaintiffs allege that Google violated the Wiretap Act, which prohibits the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications. The lawsuit actually rolls up a hodgepodge of seven individual and class action cases brought against Google, including those brought against the company for scanning messages sent from non-Gmail users. The suit maintains that, because such non-Gmail users who send emails to Gmail users never signed on to Google’s terms of services, they can never have given, in Google’s terms, “implied consent” to scan their email. The plaintiffs are seeking payouts for millions of Gmail users. The financial damages would amount to $100 per day of each day of violation for every individual who sent or received an email message using Google Apps for Education during a two-year period beginning in May 2011. The plaintiffs also want Google to be more transparent around its data-mining practices.

Reply Guy says: March 18, 2014 at 2:52 pm Anyone who emails a Gmail address knows that their emails are going to get scanned. C’mon – get real. And what difference does it make anyway? Google isn’t the NSA. Reply LuckyLuigi says: March 18, 2014 at 4:08 pm NSA has direct access to Google data, no requests or anything needed, so by default Google IS the NSA. Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 5:32 pm No. Holy hell, no. The NSA may have access to Google’s data, but I sincerely doubt that Google has access to all of the NSA’s data. So saying “The NSA IS Google” *might* have a grain of truth to it (even though it’s a pretty big exaggeration), but saying that “Google IS the NSA” is ridiculous. Reply Elias rufus says: August 21, 2016 at 6:19 pm Google is the NSA, but the NSA is not Google. It’s a subset. This is much like stating Humans are animals, animals are not humans.

We also do a lot of research that has us sign non-disclosure agreements. Seems google is looking to steal peoples ideas. Reply brianc6234 says: March 18, 2014 at 5:23 pm If that’s a problem the schools shouldn’t use Gmail. It’s their fault. For years if you use Gmail you should know they see what’s in your email. Schools can always have their own email servers. Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 5:45 pm No, because then it would be clearly documented that you had begun research before their organization. Reply H says: March 18, 2014 at 6:02 pm Google isn’t trying to steal anything… mfw. Building an advertising profile might get them in trouble, but for a lot of things it HAS to index and scan your email. EVERY email client will do that. Scanning/indexing your email is how the search works, it’s how virus scans work, spam protection, etc. Reply roxy says: March 19, 2014 at 3:50 am i’m sorry bud, but google is not actually trying to steal your thesis about how kerouac was like, a guy or whatever you have in there. Reply 2072 says: March 18, 2014 at 4:37 pm It’s true that I prefer my emails to be unsafe with Google than unsafe with the NSA as Google has no actual ‘power’ on individuals contrary to the NSA which can destroy an innocent individual’s life if it choose so based on alleged ‘proofs’ gathered through their dubious spying techniques… That being said I’d prefer my emails to be just safe from other human eyes or unknown ‘social algorithms’. Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 5:13 pm My school uses Gmail as the backbone or whatever. When I login to my schools email it IS gmail. Although if you emailed me you would be emailing the school.edu email address.. so you wouldn’t know you’re sending it to googles servers…. c’mon – get real. Reply Ian says: March 19, 2014 at 4:53 am The point is that schools require students to use Apps for Education. Everyone knows that emails are scanned, but Edu users are unique because they are legally obligated to use google services and they don’t have the opprotunity to click “decline.” Reply Wrap2tyt says: March 19, 2014 at 2:39 pm “And what difference does it make anyway? Google isn’t the NSA”… no, but they are getting rich(er). Reply Casual Friday says: December 4, 2014 at 11:54 pm Just because third party doctrine is applicable in court proceedings does not automatically give that right to a corporation. It’s a violation of trust and disgrace on a grand scale. Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 3:46 pm Exactly they are worse then the NSA since the NSA protects its citizens from harm where Google does not care to protect you at all…they just want to market fromyou. Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 8:28 pm “…the NSA protects its citizens from harm…” How’s the weather in your fantasy world? Reply 2072 says: March 18, 2014 at 4:22 pm hmmm that’s an interesting problem but I perceive Google legitimacy in doing so… They HAVE to scan and analyse received emails for several reasons: – Spam detection – Virus detection – Search indexing (it needs to build an index of terms in order to allow searching through received and sent emails…) – Importance classification (‘Priority Inbox’ that works as the opposite of spam detection) – user filtering (the different automatic filters user configure themselves). Moreover the above reasons don’t only apply to Google, ALL email providers need to scan incoming emails just to detect Virus and Spam… Reply Jack says: March 18, 2014 at 4:40 pm You have to believe NSA works directly with companies like Google… Reply PDXTony says: March 18, 2014 at 5:52 pm is this really a shock? The internet is not a guarantee of privacy. If people haven’t figured that out yet they are just being naive. (never made public email on blogs. sure but its stored right?) Google tells people up front that it will scan the information and makes assessments automatically based on that info , along with that comes spell check, search functions, etc. people want free for free and that is just not reality. I trust a private company that tells me they are doing something than the current garbage thats going on with the CIA and NSA. There will always be people that fear the worst could happen, I just tend to ignore them and I am much happier Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 6:24 pm Understand no entity or individual has the right to scan personal information period. corporations and governments are just people like you and I. There are some very outstanding people out there as well as some very unscrupulous individuals and they are at every level and all walks of life. Also realize it is a free service so you do have a vote, do not use the service if you feel uncomfortable with it. If your school administration is buying into it then the issue is with them not the provider. I do not particularly care for Google either but it is a free enterprise and if people would stop complaining and stand up for their rights through their actions (do not use and recommend to others not to use it), I think we would be better off. Regarding the NSA… people get the government they deserve, right? Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 6:53 pm Any email service that features a search function scans the content of emails that are sent and received regardless of who it was sent by. Additionally the data mining and scanning functions are outlined in the commercial agreement documents that the educational institutions would of agreed to. By proxy when the student agreed to the schools services agreement for access to school computer networks they likely agreed to any agreements the school had made with the service providers. I think this lawsuit is ridiculous and to illustrate my point the students likely didn’t agree to the network shaping techniques the schools ISP uses yet have probably used it to access all sorts of personal information, should they be allowed to sue them as well for violation of wire tap laws? Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 8:40 pm Is this a news story or an advertisement for SOPHOS? I’m confused. Reply Paul Ducklin says: March 18, 2014 at 9:22 pm Do you mean is this site “an advert for Sophos” because it’s Sophos Naked Security, and the site’s pages clearly say so? Not sure how the story itself might be an advert for our products, other than that it’s about email, and we happen to sell a range of email security products for on-site, off-site and cloud-based use…but then, because we have a range of email security products, topics to do with email and privacy are of interest to us. Reply Jim says: March 19, 2014 at 7:17 pm EVERY email system scans the emails. It’s impossible not to unless the mail is encrypted. Unless you encrypt your email, it WILL be read. Many times (once for each relay server and a couple more for good measure). Further, schools are using GMail for one main reason: Cost. They’re saving money. When they made that choice they accepted certain consequences. So, any lawsuit should be against the school, not Google.

Google Flights is one such service. It’s pretty good at what it’s supposed to do, providing features like a handy calendar to find out when fares are the cheapest. An update has been rolled out for Google Flights today which enables users to take advantage of the new price tracking feature. Again, there are countless online services that will allow you to set up a price alert to track the price of a flight that you want to catch. The alerts work very nicely by notifying you of potential opportunities to save quite a bit of money on air travel. The Google Flights update released today will now notify users when the price of a flight is expected to go up. A card will display how much the cost is going to rise and in how many days. It will also feature additional tips on lowering fares such as opting for a nearby airport or choosing to travel on alternative dates. The information isn’t always going to be completely accurate since it will be based on historical trends but it will certainly give users an idea of how they can get the most bang for their buck, even if that requires them to switch their travel dates around a bit.

Here are Google’s two most notable moves: It has begun to add airfare predictions to its metasearch tool. It has also begun to prominently encourage consumers to sign up for hotel loyalty programs for access to special rates or benefits — a ploy that dovetails with hotel chains’ efforts to encourage more direct booking. Airfare forecasts Adding predictions of price changes for plane tickets is a catch-up move. Fare forecasts have been common on a few travel metasearch platforms like FareCompare, Hopper, Kayak, and Momondo for some time. But Google’s new predictions of fare changes — along with its new email alerts to warn users if fares are likely to increase — may lure some customers away from the established metasearch competitors, given its mammoth user install base and its superior load time for delivering comprehensive search results. Google is starting to predict when fares are likely to rise for some specific flights and routes. It’s also forecasting how much a user might save by booking right away. Users holding out for a better deal can now opt to track a flight or route and receive email alerts when fares are anticipated to change. The company says that “fare expiration and expected price jump notifications will be rolling out over the coming weeks everywhere Google Flights is available.” Google is also adding tips, or pop-up boxes, with relevant shopping advice. For instance, a user may see a tip saying fares are expected to spike based on historic trends for a given route. The tip backs up its claim with specifics, saying how much the fare will probably rise and roughly when. Hotel direct booking play Google also has its eyes on hotels. Today the company says it has begun to inform travelers when savings or benefits like free wifi are available to loyalty members of hotel chains. For example, users looking for New York City hotels this winter will see on the first screen of listings a message that they can “get 10-15% off plus free wifi with loyalty sign-up.” That direct booking offer may look better than one from an online travel agency like Booking.com that may be quoting an otherwise competitive rate, as in this example: This push of direct booking comes in the wake of Expedia’s recent experiment to promote loyalty program sign-ups with hotel chain Red Lion and its trial of promoting free services at more than 5,000 hotels. Google is also making a couple of other small tweaks. One change of note is that it is adding the ability for users to filter results to only see hotels that the company considers “deals.” For now, the deal selection is “organic,” meaning it is based on an algorithm rather than marketing partnerships. A hotel is labeled a “deal” when its rate is lower than the historical average or “if there are discounts to the normal rate for those dates.” A belated recognition of fare forecasting It’s taken a long time for fare forecasting to have its global star turn. It was back in 2003 when the concept of predicting airfares using data analytics first appeared with the startup Farecast. Around the same time Rick Seaney’s Fare Compare began to deliver a similar price-prediction service using a different methodology. Farecast was a free service that helped travelers decide whether they should buy a ticket now or wait and hope that the fare drops. After raising $20.6 million, it was bought in 2008 by Microsoft for about $115 million. But Bing’s travel play never got traction with consumers. Other travel metasearch brands dismissed fare forecasts and price tracking as gimmicks that didn’t lead to conversion. But in 2013 Kayak added a price predictor tool, signaling a shift in industry views on the concept. Last year, mobile-only startup Hopper claimed hockey-stick growth, and nabbed several mobile awards, for its service that relies heavily on fare forecasts and price tracking notifications. Google’s move 13 years after the birth of the fare forecasting concept shows the long and winding route that some innovations take in the travel industry. Increased pace of product development The travel metasearch enhancements are coming much faster at Google than has historically been the case. It’s only been three months since Google added airfare tracking, hotel deal spotting, and other filters to its metasearch. And the moves come in the same year as its expansion into inspiration tools and in-destination activity recommendation in its first standalone travel app. Google’s pitch to hotels is that it is an effective way to boost direct bookings. Since summer 2015, Google Hotel Ads have worked on a commission model, which is more congenial to hotels than its original pay-per click model. The trend spotlights the company’s renewed enthusiasm for its travel tools.

Google aggregates everything and we are just applauding. Trips is just another way to make profit of all data which is sucked from free websites/free data. I wonder who will still applaude when it will be out of business/job or if not accepting to be just a slave for Google. Hello, anti trust authorities?? Reply 4 weeks ago   Dean Schmit Thanks for the latest update on this Sean! Important to note that Google commission for hotels ultimately gets translated to what they call and “effective cpc” which will determine your position and visibility.

Here's how to use Google Explore. By Jack Wallen | October 17, 2016, 7:45 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen Google is known for rolling out features for every aspect of their ecosystem. Sometimes these new features are a rousing success and sometimes a miserable failure. Other times, the new feature takes a while to gain much traction; but once it does, it winds up remaining a staple. Such will be the case for Explore. That's right, I'm calling it here: Google Explore will be one of those features you'll come to depend upon and Google will keep. It is, in a word, a winner. What is Google Explore? But what exactly is Google Explore? Although one might think it an overly complex tool. Is it a built-in AI that monitors what you type and responds, with related, on-the-fly content as you type? Although Explore does function, in part, like a second pair of eyes reading over your shoulder, it isn't quite that fluid. Let's take a look at how Explorer works and I'll explain. How to use Google Explorer When you open up a Docs, Sheets, or Slides document, you will find a small button at the bottom right of the window (Figure A). That button launches Explore. Figure A Image: Jack Wallen Launching explore is but a click away. When you click the Explore button, the tool will open as a right pane (Figure B) and remain until you close it. Figure B Image: Jack Wallen Explore open with related content. Theoretically speaking, Explore should open with content related to what you are typing at the time. So far I've not experienced this nearly as seamlessly as Google would have us believe. In fact, while crafting this post, I've opened Explore at various points, only to see the tool offer the same content, regardless of what I'm typing. Even if I go off topic. Say, I mention Elementary OS Loki. Explore still insists on handing me the same related research (about Google). The good news is Explore does allow you to do manual searches. To me, this is one of the handiest features of the tool. Instead of having to open up a separate browser tab, I can simply pop open Explore and enter my search text in the Search area at the top of the window. Hit Enter and your new search will appear (Figure C). Figure C Image: Jack Wallen Even if you go off topic, Explore is there to help. Even still, the related research does very often come in handy, even if it does tend to be a bit focused on your initial topic. Help with Sheets If you're a user of Google Sheets, you'll really appreciate what Explore has to offer. Open up a Google Sheets (either pre-existing or new) document, highlight some data (or add data and then highlight), and click the Explore button. The tool will then offer you information on functions, formatting, and more (Figure D). Figure D Image: Jack Wallen Using Explore within a Google Sheets document. If you've ever wanted a quick means to easily format a collection of cells, Explore offers exactly that. With your cells highlighted, open up Explore and then click the option you like best under the FORMATTING section. It's that easy. Need a chart? Explore will create an on-the-fly chart based on the data you've highlighted. Click and drag the chart onto your document and you're ready to go (Figure E). Figure E Image: Jack Wallen Adding a chart to your Sheets has never been this easy. Help with slides As for Google Slides, Explore will offer quick and easy slide layouts, based on the content of your slide. Create the first slide, open Explore, and click on the layout you like best (Figure F). Figure F Image: Jack Wallen Changing the look of your slides is a click away. Explore also offers the ability to search (web, images, and Google Docs), while you're working with Sheets and Slides. A feature to depend on Google has brought something seriously special to Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Since I first started using Explore, I've worked it into my daily routine, leaving it open with nearly every document I write within Google Docs. It's incredibly helpful, easy to use, and will become a tool you will depend upon. Automatically sign up for TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise Newsletter for more hot tips and tricks.

This is because Google is currently rolling out version 9.39 of the app with a new Traffic Nearby shortcut.  According to PhoneArena. the new update for Google Maps for the Android OS has a useful shortcut that does not require one to launch Driving Mode just to obtain traffic information about a certain location. This new shortcut readily directs users to relevant information about a certain location’s real-time traffic displayed on the Traffic Nearby screen. The shortcut is advantageous not only because it quickly provides pertinent traffic data, it also makes it easy for users to view information that would be helpful in deciding which destination to choose when potential traffic jams are considered. Related Stories Google Maps For iOS Has A New Update Google Creates New, Smarter AI Google's Android Wear 2.0 Smartwatches Set For Early 2017 Release To make the most out of this new Traffic Nearby feature, the app’s widget should be launched on the home screen. The Next Web reports that to do this, one should look for the Maps widget on the launcher’s widget library, select it and place the 1x1 shortcut on the home screen. As of late, the Traffic Nearby feature is exclusive only to the Android app. Google has yet to make this available on its iOS counterpart. For Android users, the update is reportedly being rolled out in batches, so it’s up to them to check its availability in the Play Store.  Previously, Google launched a new feature for its Maps app that was primarily helpful to driving users. The feature was hands-free support in order for users to rely on voice commands in finding locations or getting information about the weather while handling the steering wheel.  Meanwhile, the news about the new Android app update comes exactly a week after Google Maps for iOS received its version 4.23.0 update that came with redesigned Nearby Transit and Travel times widgets and a new feature that allowed users to view detailed descriptions of certain places.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

'The Simpsons' celebrates 600 episodes with a VR couch gag Engadget UK 17/10/2016 Matt Brian © Provided by Engadget UK Even if you think The Simpsons has lost its spark, there's no denying that the show does a great job at keeping up with popular culture and technology. It's already taken on Apple (and its leader Steve Mobs), parodied Google Glass and let us watch Marge become addicted to a game that bares an uncanny resemblance to World of Warcraft. To celebrate its 600th episode (and 27th installment of the annual Treehouse of Horror), the show's creators produced another memorable couch gag, this time offering it in VR with help from Google Cardboard. For the opening of Treehouse of Horror XXVII, which aired last night, viewers were treated to a Planet of the Apes parody called Planet of the Couches. Fans could (and still can) download the Google Spotlight Stories app (available on both iOS and Android) to engage with a 360-degree experience that responds to their movement. The couch gag normally runs for 45 seconds, but Planet of the Couches offers an extra two minutes of bonus content. We won't ruin it for you but there are six different scenes that include a Moe's "Cavern" and a snarky quip from The Comic Book Guy. Just make sure to explore all 360 degrees to catch all of the clever references and in-jokes.

Singh said consumers will soon see eight to ten Daydream-compatible smartphones hit the market, which will help to scale up the platform’s ecosystem.   He also reiterated that Google went for comfort with a headset that is fabric-based and akin to another piece of clothing.   And the platform begins to run when a smartphone is matched with the headset because the two sides talk wirelessly. “As soon as you drop in the phone, you’re in VR,” Singh explained. “It takes all the friction out of being in VR.”   That thought also went into the Daydream’s controller, which features a clickable swipe pad with nine built-in sensors. “You can actually write your name in VR,” he said, noting that “it’s not for the hard-core gamer…it’s for all of us.”   On the content end, Daydream will work with Google’s own platforms, including YouTube (both 2D and newer content product in 360-degrees) and Google Maps, which will feature more than 70 “curated journeys” for VR. More than 70 Daydream apps will be available before the end of the year, Singh said.   Singh also was asked about Google’s interest in augmented reality.   ‘It’s a great future platform technology,” he said, noting that it’s also complex, but was an area where Google is investing. “I’d just say, stay tuned,”  Want to read more stories like this?

I tweeted it and it went a bit mad then everyone was trying to help me get me back to Manchester. Then KLM Airlines heard and they got me through real quick. How weird is that! They’re not holding the gold medal against me too much over there - very ironic that the British airways couldn’t help me out and the Dutch came to the rescue. “It’s been so cool. We all got really emotional on the lorry thing. Even in this weather people are out to see us - it’s absolutely freezing cold and wet and they’ve all still got smiles on their faces.

Diane Clarke, the mother of Para canoeist Rob Oliver. Photograph: Josh Halliday for the Guardian Oliver, 28, an aeronautical engineer from Birmingham who happens to be the world’s 5th best para canoeist, suffered a double break of his right leg in a football accident in 2008. He suffered a series of complications and had 17 operations before the leg was eventually amputated. Then last year, after winning silver at the European championships in Milan, he was mugged - suffering a serious shoulder injury in the process. Not that any of that stopped him from standing on the podium in Rio. “The Paralympians before they even start training are inspirational. It’s a word that’s used too often but when you see what they go through before they event start competing it is unbelievable,” she said. “Even coming here today sitting on the train and I said I can’t believe we’re going to Manchester to watch Rob in the Olympic and Paralympic parade. It’s unreal really.” “2008 was a vile vile vile year and for him to come back from that is amazing. He was very angry, very depressed but through it all he was still Rob - thank god he came back.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.41pm EDT 12:41 Rain, what rain?

The parade, which precedes a similar celebration in London on Tuesday, will feature around 350 Olympians and Paralympians, including heptathlete Jessica Ennis Hill, who last week announced her retirement, boxer Nicola Adams, Paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds and Britain’s first gymnastics gold medallist Max Whitlock. The city is a fitting venue for the event, as athletes from Greater Manchester, particularly cyclists, many of whom live near the city’s velodrome, played a significant part in Britain’s best ever performance at an overseas Olympics, which saw Team GB bring back 67 medals - 27 gold, 23 silver and 17 bronze - as they finished second in the medals table. The Paralympians recorded their performance ever, winning 147 medals, 27 more than at London 2012. The parade, which will include performances from Rebecca Ferguson and the Kaiser Chiefs, is due to begin at 4.30pm and the excitement is already building, especially about the lion who will lead the parade.

All enterprise intranets and social networks have the same glaring flaw that technology cannot fix: search. Search not only doesn’t work, it can’t work without the active engagement of employees on intranets — which creates a Catch 22.  Bad search discourages employees from engaging, and lack of employee engagement on an intranet fails to provide the content that search depends on.  The Only Consistent Thing About Enterprise Search is Disappointment My claim may not be based on qualitative research, but I’ve spent the majority of the last 20 years creating employee-facing content platforms.  And without fail, all point to one glaring flaw. In each and every context, whether as a consultant or an employee, all anecdotal stories and formal research projects lead back to “search doesn’t work.” I’ve spoken a bit about this problem from the knowledge management perspective: Ask anyone who has a history managing an intranet why their internal search functionality is not as good as Google and you'll see them wince. The playing field is just not fair (if you doubt me, ask yourself why Google appliances don't dominate the internal search marketplace to the point of monopoly).  Google's algorithms depend on contextual assumptions that only apply in the internet — enormous scale, voluntary cross linking and referencing, and an entire industry devoted to indexing, scraping, tagging and SEO. Since none of these are present inside the walled gardens of internal content stores, the best technology for finding relevant content just doesn't apply here (at least not as people envision it). The downward spiral of expectations and behavior has been the hardest thing to accept with enterprise search.  Even with auto-tagging solutions applied to content, search engines have been unable to raise relevance within results high enough to meet either employee or executive expectations  Disappointment becomes disaffection in a heartbeat. Disaffected employees natural response is to stand up their own siloed content stores that meet their specific need, thus splintering the value of the intranet.  This is where the cycle starts to repeat itself: It Comes Down to Organizational Priorities While it’s true that nobody sets out to create a horrible intranet experience, it’s equally true that enterprises have intentionally institutionalized metrics that favor short-term dollars over long-term employee productivity. This throws sand in the gears of what it would take to pull an intranet out of the downward spiral of dwindling engagement. Why does an enterprise prioritization model that indexes on short term gain impact intranet engagement?  This is where it gets messy.  Here’s how the conversation goes between an individual contributor who sees no reason to contribute to an intranet and a leader who sees the larger context referred to in the above diagram: Individual contributor: Our agile team just solved that major technical problem we uncovered last week. It was a bear, but we got through it. Leader: Great! Did you document it, so that people understand the problem and solution next time it happens? Individual contributor: Not any more than our communications between teams. What’s the point? Nobody can find anything on the intranet anyway. It’s like dumping knowledge into a black hole. People only use it for links to other employee systems. Leader: I understand why it feels like that. Do you get that “non contributing” teams are the actual reason that search doesn’t work on the intranet? It needs lots of content and lots of users for it to do it’s job well. Individual contributor: Maybe so, but me contributing this one artifact won’t have any effect on that problem and I’ve got other work to do that aligned with corporate goals and I’m consistently working between 50 and 60 hours a week. This conversation encapsulates the enterprise engagement problem perfectly.  While it may be true that enterprises have long-term investments designed to improve productivity and quality at play, it is also true that these efforts are very often treated as noise compared to revenue-generating activities.  People who attempt to gain support for making better employee tools and experiences face an uphill battle much steeper than those going after near term revenue. Flip the Search Model on Its Head Is it possible to turn the whole thing upside down? Can we drive engagement to drive search rather than drive search to drive engagement?  I haven’t seen or heard anyone trying this, but I’ve talked with a few employee experience professionals and they are all willing to give it a go. How far you take it depends on how you prioritize having a more productive and meaningfully engaged workforce along with the current level of disaffection in your key staff segments.  Here are a couple of options to get you started, ranging from measured to crazy: Content to Reward Integration  More than a few rewards and recognition apps (e.g., achievers.com, kudos, etc.) are available where employees can thank each other for jobs well done. I haven’t seen them fully integrated into intranet and ESN content.  Imagine being able to thank your colleagues with more than a “like” and something more substantive than a game badge. With the right budget strategy and some cool rewards behind it, teams can begin to reward each other not just for solving problems today, but also for helping solve them in sustainable ways by working out loud. Right-Sized Rewards How hard would it be to take the intranet gamification metrics and apply formal bonuses to them (in either prize or cash format) outside of the existing compensation system?  It might seem like bribery at first glance, but so does any other bonus mechanism. Even Dan Pink, author of Drive, would admit that intrinsic motivation without any incentive and reward structure is not likely to change the tide of a disaffected work force. Pay for Performance It’s only a matter of time before one of the SaaS intranet/ESN providers offers a “guaranteed engagement pricing model” where their subscription cost is complemented by an “employee engagement factor.” If Jive or Microsoft or Salesforce or Google wanted to, they could find ways to compensate and reward employees for the contributions to the intranet that would complete the search ecosystem. If the pay for performance model seems completely ridiculous to you, consider if it is any more ridiculous than: companies opening up their data for free as a competitive edge (e.g., open APIs) companies and government institutions putting their most critical applications and data in the hands of third parties (e.g., the cloud) companies paying hackers to break their systems (e.g., white hat hackathons) The fundamentals of getting the knowledge-driven enterprise to share and collaborate haven’t changed substantially since intranets and content/document management first arrived on the scene. Isn’t it time we tried something just a little bit crazy?  Title image "Handstand!" (CC BY 2.0) by josephleenovak About the Author Stephen Fishman has been working with enterprises both as an employee and a consultant for more than 20 years.

Comment Print May 23.2013   NB: This is a guest article from Gary Leff, a frequent flier mileage expert who blogs at View from the Wing. It’s finally happening. TripAdvisor is going to go big in hotel metasearch as a way to drive bookings. The announcement made me wonder about the bigger picture: How is the industry evolving? It’s not news that hotel chains want to push guests toward booking through the chains’ own channels. Chains have been trying to do that for years. For instance, they’ve long denied elite stay credit to bookings made through online travel agents. In some cases, chains have even denied elite benefits to OTA referrals. Chains like Starwood Hotels & Resorts, InterContinental Hotels Group, and Wyndham Hotel Group also offer “best price guarantees” meant to suggest that customers will get the best deals on the chains’ own websites. (Nevermind that these guarantees are not always true. What’s actually happening is that, on some rare occasions, the chains will reward customers who discover the chains haven’t offered the best rate. Even so, the guarantees still demonstrate an effort by chains to drive business to their own channels.) The shift to supplier direct accelerated in 2012 In recent years, supplier sites have gained at the expense of OTAs. PhoCusWright’s latest Consumer Travel Report shows some interesting stats: Supplier websites were a hit across the board, but last year … younger guests (age 18-34) especially switched to supplier sites to book lodging (up 12 percentage points in usage from 2011) and away from using OTAs (down to 39% from 45% in 2011). In the age 35-to 55 category, online direct gained nine percentage points in just one year. Age played a huge role in booking dynamics for lodging — even more significant than for air. Cutting out the middleman Hotels want to drive bookings to their own channels because the payouts to online agents for hotel bookings are huge. To be sure, commissions seem to be declining lately. I used to see major chains paying out commissions in high 20% ranges, while more recently such high payouts seem to apply mostly to independent hotels. The savvier big chains like Marriott, depending on the online channel, may have negotiated down the payouts to the high teens. But those payouts are still high enough to represent a real cost to any chains’ bottom line, so there’s still an incentive to push consumers to book directly. Where’s Google? Interestingly, the leading threat to OTAs ought to be coming from Google. Most searches still start at Google, after all. But this threat hasn’t materialized. Google is certainly trying to provide customized answers and advice in the travel space, yet the conventional wisdom is that Google hasn’t made much of an impact. Anti-trust concerns voiced by Google’s rivals have failed to persuade the US government to shut down Google as a competitor (mostly, to date, in flight search – and fortunately, to date, unsuccessfully). Kayak may accelerate hotel metasearch as a trend The competition here is far from over. Priceline’s purchase of Kayak highlights the fact that metasearch is a growing category, and metasearch tends to work in favor of direct hotel channel bookings. But Kayak certainly will face pressure because while it can find you lots of different hotels (compared to chain sites which generally offer their brand only), it doesn’t do a good job at guiding you to book the room that’s most right for you. There’s an opening for sites like Room 77 here, though these sites also have flaws. TripAdvisor is well positioned Whereas flight sales aren’t especially lucrative, hotels bookings are, and TripAdvisor is naturally positioned to get a strong piece of that action. TripAdvisor (in theory, though not always in practice) guides you toward the hotel that’s right for you. It ought to be better at monetizing the consumer’s decision, especially if it wants to compete with companies like Kayak. The trouble with TripAdvisor I’ve often found TripAdvisor useful (1) for real guest photos, and (2) to scan common themes in reviews. But never for the rankings, and never for the content of any single review. But there are several problems with TripAdvisor. One is fake reviews: hotels with fake personas trashing their competitors, hotels giving themselves high marks. Another is the inherent unreliability of complainers who also may represent outliers among guests. And still another is that the rankings aren’t valid interpersonal comparisons. The guest doing a ranking may simply not think about hotels the same way that you do. And rankings are often simply not reasonable reflections of what a hotel is trying to accomplish. (Imagine knocking down the Ritz-Carlton Central Park because its room service breakfast is expensive… Well, of course it is expensive.) Hotels have tried to compete as well (remember, they really want you to book direct) with their own reviews. And they can even verify that a guest writing a review has really stayed at a hotel! A need for personalization/customization The big thing that was lost when mass travel became substantially an online booking phenomena was the loss of human agents who could understand your preferences, combine your preferences with their own personal experience, and make recommendations that were in theory tied to the individual customer. That’s also the future once again, even in the online booking space as sites race to get better at doing more than just returning results in a city and letting you sort by price or distance or ‘number of stars.’ No one is very good at it yet. Orbitz fumbled when they started returning higher priced hotels to Mac users, a story broken by the WSJ. Orbitz wasn’t trying to “charge those customers more”, I bet. They just didn’t want the customers not to find what they were after and go somewhere else to book instead. I suspect that all that Orbitz was trying to do was respond to its data that suggested that Mac users tended to book higher priced hotels than PC users, and so wanted to give those customers tailored results that were more likely to lead to a sale. There’s still a lot of room for work to be done, and I suspect the conventional wisdom about hotel booking competition may yet be proven wrong. I’ll especially be watching developments for mobile devices, where last minute bookings are increasingly common, and customized advice won’t just be based on other guests’ experiences (social) but also on real-time geolocation data.

Very comprehensive, well researched and definitely a thoughtful piece. I’d agree that even with all of the entrenched incumbents, and recent promising upstarts, you’ve mentioned here, the industry still has plenty of way to go before delivering what’s possible – even by today’s standards and available technology. We’ve definitely only seen the tip of the iceberg. Everything from the variety of possible online user and personalized shopping experiences, to the infinite number of ways that business models can potentially be improved upon to deliver added value to both the supplier and the customer, are still yet to really, seriously be discovered. The only group you neglected to reference in your article are the new entrants to the travel space – the “disruptors” – and the limitless potential that they may have to make a substantial and sustained run at today’s “Big Boys” – but if you were to do that, you’d be psychic, I suppose. Point being, nobody, especially the incumbents, should be so complacent to underestimate the “unknown” as they are the ones who are free to do whatever they want – their possibilities are literally, limitless. You never can tell what’s going to happen in the future. What was it that Bill Gates said back in the day (B.G. – Before Google) when asked, “What company do you fear most?” and he prophetically predicted, “The guys in a garage somewhere, that nobody’s heard of.” Even though he had the wisdom to recognize where his ultimate competition and nemeses would from, even Microsoft were not powerful enough to stop the avalanche, that we now know to be Google. I wonder who the next one will be? As a (wise)man said above, “watch this space!” 😉 Reply 3 years ago   Steve Reynolds What’s missing in the direct price guarantee is the ability to be aware when prices change not only at my current hotel but a similar hotel down the street. To get the best rate, a traveler should be able to easily create a basket of hotels that are similar base upon their criteria, easily find the best “flexible” rate across several hotels, become aware when rates change, and easily change a reservation from one hotel to the next. If you do this robotic-ally, the savings is significant (30% or more). Reply 3 years ago   Sean O'Neill Hi Steve, Thanks for your comment. It’s interesting that this space hasn’t been explored yet, though Yapta and Tingo have flirted with it. Best, Sean Reply 3 years ago   John Pope Sean, I’m guessing, Mr Reynolds, is about to share a new and exciting place where all of those dreams just identified may very well come true, in future… watch this space, as they say. 😉 @Steve, I suspect it may be just a coincidence, but it would be amazing if Emeril LaGasse was one of your investors. Even better if he’s your actual spokesperson / celebrity hotel critic. “A little bit of chilli in your (hotel) sheets stay… BAM” !!! Now that, would be classic. 🙂 Reply 3 years ago   ADVERTISEMENT <a href="https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a2bfe3f0&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-widget', 'https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a2bfe3f0&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE', '');" target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=45&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a2bfe3f0' border='0' alt='' /></a> ADVERTISEMENT <a href="https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=aa0a2c91&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-widget', 'https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=aa0a2c91&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE', '');" target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=47&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=aa0a2c91' border='0' alt='' /></a> ADVERTISEMENT <a href="https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a365b2b5&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-widget', 'https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a365b2b5&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE', '');" target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=51&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a365b2b5' border='0' alt='' /></a> ADVERTISEMENT <a href="https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a9b3a1d3&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-widget', 'https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a9b3a1d3&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE', '');" target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=60&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a9b3a1d3' border='0' alt='' /></a>   <a href='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a3e1f225&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=56&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a3e1f225' border='0' alt='' /></a>   Return to the top of page Articles Overview Devices Distribution Marketing Social Startups Systems Travel sectors Regions About Overview Our History Contact People Partners Advertise Overview Media pack Events Overview Calendar Thack Tnooz live Webinars   All rights reserved © 2016 tnooz Privacy Copyright Disclaimer Ethics statement Site Map   Design and development by Momentum Design Lab   Latest News Travelport sets MD for SA and ME, Clicktripz EMEA boss, Hotelbeds activities, and more...

As The Verge reports, the web giant now includes a fact check label that highlights reliable sources in news searches. Using an algorithm, Google’s Claim Review process decides which stories qualify for the “fact check” distinction then specifies the sources that hold themselves to that standard. The description pops up next to stories like other Google News markers including “opinion,” “highly cited,” and “in-depth.” Google doesn’t share how many sites it has deemed worthy of the label, but the company states in a blog post that “rigorous fact checks are now conducted by more than 100 active sites.” As viral Facebook posts and convincing satire articles have shown us, the internet can easily spread misinformation. It can also be used as a valuable research tool—something Google’s new feature aims to emphasize. [h/t The Verge] Know of something you think we should cover? Email us at tips@mentalfloss.com.

Google has long been involved in pushing technology to improve and modernize education, but with the launch of the Center it hopes to spur a community of educational thought leaders to action. Persuading schools to adopt innovative technology is not as simple as it may seem, there are often cultural obstacles that need to be overcome and leadership that embraces positive change and strategies to bring all stakeholders on board through transparency and learning programs. Technology can't just be forced on educators, it needs to be first embraced as a solution by educators to a perceived problem. Finally, school leaders need to budget for change and improvement, so that technology is about student progress and not funding reallocation. "Over the past few years we’ve had the privilege to work closely with thousands of schools that are seeking to improve and innovate with the help of technology," said Liz Anderson, who is Google's Global Lead for their Education Adoption Programs. "Every school is different, but we’ve heard a lot of common themes from educators: that change is hard; that change is about a whole lot more than just technology; and that obstacles are often similar across districts." She added, "School leaders face many of the same challenges and opportunities, but often have limited ways to share with — and learn from — each other. That’s why we’ve created a new hub for school leaders to share ideas, resources, and stories: The Google for Education Transformation Center." The 7 Critical Areas for School Change Google brought educational leaders together from all over the US to create a "transformation framework" guiding schools to improving education through innovation and technology: Vision - School change only happens when there is a strong vision at the start. When a school has a clear vision, it means the leader has ensured that the school and wider community are working together toward shared goals for the future. Learning - School leaders empower their teams to create a set of instructional practices, curricula, assessments, and learning experiences that put students at the center - that engage learners deeply and meet their individual and collective needs. Culture - Successful school leaders create structures, rituals, stories, and symbols that foster a culture of innovation and encourage people to learn from failure and success. Technology - Technology is only one enabler of school change, but it's a critical part. School leaders find, test, and gain their team's support for the right technology (tools and processes) to meet the school’s vision. Professional Development - Teachers have a lot on their plates. School leaders provide educators with effective professional development and ongoing coaching focused on applying tools and practices to meet student needs. Funding & Sustainability - School leaders create a sustainable budget, identify a range of funding sources, and seek savings and reallocation opportunities that align directly to student goals. Community - Schools serve diverse communities made up of parents, families, businesses, government, nonprofits, and residents. Throughout all stages of the transformation process, leaders ensure these partners support the school and the vision.

We got an incredible Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge combo, a decent HTC 10, the budget-friendly OnePlus 3 and the modular (if you think snap-on accessories really count) Moto Z. The LG G5 was a dud, but the biggest disappointment of the year has been the explosive Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Samsung’s Note series has played a huge role in the development of Android over the years. The Note popularized the concept of the phablet and has been considered a must-have device for Android enthusiasts who want the newest technology smartphone manufacturers have to offer. Unfortunately for Samsung, the Note 7 crashed and burned (literally) due to battery issues and has pulled it from the market. But the death of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 may create the perfect environment for the Google’s new Pixel phones to thrive in. With 2.5 million Samsung Galaxy Note 7 owners looking for a new device, the launch of the Pixel may have come just at the right time. There are plenty of Note 7 owners who will choose to stay with Samsung, but a recent survey of 1,000 Samsung smartphone owners shows 40% of them are likely to switch brands when purchasing their next device. On top of that, the Note 7 being pulled from store shelves leaves a huge void in the high-end smartphone segment. This is great news for Google as the Pixel XL is one of the few devices which matches the price, size and performance of the Note 7. Google should be able to pick up quite a few disgruntled Samsung users due to the Note 7 recall, but the void left by the absence of Samsung’s flagship smartphone may prove to be even more important to the success of the Pixel.  The Pixel XL is a great alternative to the Note 7 The fundamental selling points of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and Pixel XL may be different, but the two phones have quite a bit in common and there are a few advantages that the Pixel XL has over the Note 7. The obvious drawback of the Pixel XL is that it lacks the Note 7’s S Pen. This will definitely be a deal breaker for those who purchased the Note 7 for its S Pen functionality. If you fall into that category, the only real option at your disposal is last year’s Note 5. LG does have a few smartphones which are bundled with a stylus, but none of them come close to matching the functionality of the S Pen. The Pixel’s main selling point is its gimmick-less simplicity. It’s the Android alternative to the iPhone, but in a good way. The software is clean, the camera is good, the hardware is fast and responsive and the design is simple, yet elegant. Since the Note 7 isn’t really an option anymore, the only real alternatives are the Pixel XL, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and LG V20. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 edge has the advantage when it comes to design, but the Pixel takes the lead on the camera front, performance, the new Google Assistant, software updates directly from Google and great battery life. The LG V20 is a great contender as well, but LG has had a tough time convincing consumers to buy its flagship-tier smartphones as of late. Verizon exclusivity will hold the Pixel back Initial estimates showed that Google would likely sell 3-4 million Pixel phones in 2016. Now that the Note 7 is out of the picture, there’s a good chance that the HTC-built Pixel phones will sell event better. But there is a slight problem: Verizon is the only service provider in the US which will be selling the Pixel phones at launch. Signing a deal with Verizon to help promote and selling the Pixel may have been a good idea a few months back, but the Note 7’s recall has changed the landscape significantly. Verizon may be the largest service provider in the US with 35% of the market, but only a handful of consumers will be willing to leave their current service provider and join Verizon to purchase the Pixel or Pixel XL. Unlocked versions of the Pixel phones are available online, but the majority of US customers are still inclined to purchase a new smartphone from their service provider. The Pixel’s success isn’t assured The death of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 doesn’t guarantee that the Pixel will be a smash hit, but it does give Google a much better chance at establishing a good foothold in the high-end smartphone segment. Google will have to work hard if it wants to capitalize on the situation since Samsung will be fighting tooth and nail to retain market share. With a million and one factors which determine the success or failure of a device, it’s impossible to know if the death of the Note 7 will be the spark needed for Google’s Pixel phones to rise to prominence. Hopefully, Google plays its cards right with this unique opportunity it’s been handed. local_offer    Google   Pixel   Pixel XL   Samsung   Samsung Galaxy Note 7   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (51) stars Further Reading The Verizon Pixel XL is delayed again Samsung begins working on Android Nougat for the Galaxy S6 The Play Store sees another update Verizon launches BOGO deal Gear S3 launches November 18th. stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

How Google feels about SEO is open to question, but we can say for sure that when you could just pump out reams of garbage content stuffed with keywords and get your site above the fold on the first page, they hated it. Panda’s whole purpose was to make search rank correlate with quality. Which is a good thing. Trouble is, Panda blew a lot of folks out of the water. Not just spammy listicles, keyword stuffers, and link buyers, but a whole slew of people who followed the best available advice in January 2011. Come February; Panda rolled out and their rankings were badly reduced. The workings of Google’s algorithms is always proprietary. We keep trying to guess; they keep changing the rules. As a result, there are beliefs about the way Panda actually works and even what it’s for that have clung on for years. Some of them aren’t true anymore; some of them were never true; all of them are myths that could lead you to waste your time and even potentially damage your search rank. #1 – There Will be a Panda Update Soon There sure will. Tomorrow, in fact – and the day after. In March of 2013, Google announced that Panda would become Panda “Everflux”, integrated with the basic search algorithm and updated constantly. This myth comes from the impact of the initial Panda rollout, when the desired effect of Panda – spammy sites tumbled down the rankings – were accompanied by numerous undesired outcomes including many scraped sites actually rising up the rankings. In short, the result of the initial Panda rollout was chaos. People look to the likelihood of a “new” Panda update in deep concern in case all that happens again. The worst downside of this myth is that we’re all like sportspeople taking our eyes off the ball to look at the (non-existent) UFO. There are important Google updates that are changing the way online business is conducted, and because they’re not labeled “Panda” we’re all looking the other way. Last April’s mobile-friendly update hit more sites than Panda (or Penguin, come to that) but it caused less of a stir. We’ve learned to live with Panda, and it’s helped a lot of us by making content marketing and search optimization a lot easier to align. #2 – The Duplicate Content Filter is Part of Panda This one is just totally untrue. It’s common, though, because they aim at similar results – rewarding quality – and they came in at the same time. In a Twitter discussion with Marie Haynes, Google’s John Mueller said categorically that “Those are 2 separate & independent things.” That seems pretty final. But it doesn’t mean that you’re not going to get slapped for having a bunch of duplicate content. Google has gotten a little more sophisticated at dealing with duplicate content over the years – after all, nearly every site has some. But large amounts will open you up to loss of traffic. It’s not technically a penalty. It sure feels like one when your traffic nosedives, but when you fix it and your site gets recrawled, the traffic should recover. That doesn’t happen with Panda penalties. There’s also a big difference between the effects of duplicate content within your site and duplicated content from elsewhere on the web: one dilutes traffic and the other sets red flags flying at Google HQ. E-commerce sites are particularly at risk here because they have thousands of product pages that might be using the manufacturer’s product descriptions or generic placeholders. Canonical tags for duplicate pages and your own copy are the cure. #3 – Too Much UGC Will Attract Panda User-generated content used to be the Holy Grail. It’s social proof, it’s content for free, and it’s proof of deep engagement. People don’t contribute content to websites they don’t care about. Post Panda, that began to change. And now SEOs are recommending that clients remove all the user-generated content from their websites. Once again, this is an overreaction based on misunderstanding what Panda’s all about. It’s not about user-generated, old, thin, whatever. It’s about quality. Some UGC is very high quality, while some is people telling you how you won’t believe how they made money online with this simple trick. Too much of that second kind can actually go against you, as Google’s John Mueller explains: “Another thing… which is common with forums is low-quality user-generated content. If you have ways of recognizing this kind of content, and blocking it from indexing, it can make it much easier for algorithms to review the overall quality of your website.” The alleged UGC price is even worse if your site is a forum or acts like one. In cases like Stack Overflow and Quora where almost all the content is user-generated, what is the risk that Google will hunt down spammy UGC? This very thing happened to Mozilla back in 2013. Mueller recommends cleaning house before you get hit with a penalty: “The same methods can be used to block forum spam from being indexed for your forum. Depending on the forum, there might be different ways of recognizing that automatically, but it’s generally worth finding automated ways to help you keep things clean & high-quality, especially when a site consists of mostly user-generated content.” It’s worth revisiting Mueller’s point about high-quality UGC: when you collate it right UGC campaigns can be among the best forms of content in Google’s eyes, as well as being inspiring and effective for users. Many forum sites run on a question-and-answer basis. One effective way of keeping poor content out of the bots’ claws without messing up your site’s running is to no-index pages that have questions but no answers or that have only posts from the OP of the thread. When useful content builds, those pages can be indexed. #4 – All Pages Need to be High Quality This is probably the biggest myth about Panda. That every single page needs to be perfect for the site to rank at all, and if there’s anything on there that Panda doesn’t like, the whole site will suffer. In fact, Panda is sometimes applied in quite a granular fashion and generally poor-quality penalties will hit individual pages, not the whole site. The site’s main pages can still rank well even if some of that site’s content doesn’t. What you’re looking for is the overall picture Google gets of your site. If you have an awesome site with a few bad pages, Panda might hit those pages but your site will rank well just the same. The other way around won’t work out so well. Yoast’s Joost de Valk explains: “Panda usually affects your site because you have too many low quality pages as a proportion of your overall number of pages.” Identifying pages that need to be fixed is a matter of checking in your analytics tool to find pages with low traffic and high bounce. Apply common sense: some pages might be really useful for the few visitors they get. Some might have what looks like a high bounce rate because visitors get what they need fast and leave. Conclusion Panda is a different beast when you look at it close up. Far from being capricious, Panda’s demands seem fairly reasonable when you know what they actually are and how to work with them. Don’t let myths about certain types of content, content length, or some impending Pandageddon update stop you from making your site Panda-friendly!

For the first time, Glenn is speaking at our SEJ Summit conference series. We are so excited to have such a talented SEO sharing the stage with the rest of our great speakers. Below, I asked Glenn a little more about what he’s covering at SEJ Summit NYC in November 2nd, 2016. Your SEJ Summit presentation is titled: What the Doctor Ordered: Your Yearly Google Algorithm Update Checkup (2016 Edition). In your opinion, what was the biggest update SEOs should be paying attention to this year? Based on its frequency and level of impact, I believe Google’s quality updates (AKA Phantom) are incredibly important to pay attention to. And we’ve seen several quality updates in 2016. As a quick reminder, the first quality update rolled out in May of 2015 and impacted many sites globally. Google finally confirmed that they did roll out an update and explained that it was a change to its core ranking algorithm with how it assessed “quality”. And with Google always trying to surface the highest quality and most relevant content for users, that’s an incredibly important statement. Since May of 2015, we’ve seen six significant quality updates (and three in 2016 so far). The updates are global and industry-agnostic (I’ve seen many different types of sites impacted by Phantom). And websites seeing impact during a quality update can absolutely see the impact by subsequent updates (either reversing course, surging more, or declining further). That’s why I believe SEOs and business owners should be keenly aware of Phantom, and its history. Here are my posts about the November and June quality updates. Both were significant. For example, here are two sites surging and dropping during the November 2015 update, and both saw impact during Phantom 2 as well (in May of 2015):   Let’s talk about Phantom. Part of what makes this update so elusive is that Google plays the ‘neither confirm nor deny’ game. What do SEOs most need to know about this update? Should we be worried? You’re right; Google will typically not confirm changes to its core ranking algorithm. That said, they did confirm the first quality update, and then confirmed “core ranking algorithm changes” during certain subsequent updates. But when major algorithm updates roll out, you can start to see a connection with previous updates. For example, sites impacted by a new update that also saw impact during previous quality updates. That’s when you can start to understand if the update was indeed Phantom. Here is an excellent example of a site seeing impact across several quality updates. You can clearly see the connection between them: But to make matters even tougher for SEOs, Google can absolutely retire Phantom at any point. They can also push it to real-time at some point. And if they do either, then we’ll have no idea that happened and may never see another immediate drop or spike like in the past (with Phantom anyway). On that note, Panda is now part of Google’s core ranking algorithm. It’s not real-time yet, but continually rolls out slowly across the web. Therefore, we’ll never see another old-school Panda update (with significant movement all on one day). And I believe Google likes it that way. No drama, no media attention, no subsequent analysis, etc. Moz is reporting an “unnamed update” in just the last week or two. (September 2016). What are your thoughts on their report? Yes, there was another big update starting on August 31, 2016. But I don’t believe we saw just one update. I believe we saw three (two roll out and one being tested). The first was spotted by Joy Hawkins and it was a local algorithm update. That rolled out about the same time as a core ranking algorithm update (which I believe was another quality update). Many of the sites impacted by the core ranking algo change (that rolled out after the local update) had been previously impacted by other quality updates. And then about a week later I saw sites that had previous link problems (and Penguin problems) spike. Others saw that too, like Marie Haynes. So Google could have been testing Penguin 4 (or another link-based algorithm). And now that we know Penguin 4.0 rolled out, which Google announced on September 23, that third movement we saw very well could have been Penguin 4 being tested in the wild. Needless to say, it’s always tricky when Google rolls out multiple algorithm updates at one time, or across a short period. And yes, Google can and will roll out multiple updates simultaneously. My favorite example was the algorithm sandwich in April of 2012. That’s when Google rolled out Panda, then Penguin 1.0, and then Panda again all within a ten-day period. It was crazy. What strategies do you recommend for long-term Google algo update protection? I hear a lot of “just write good content, and you will always be safe!” That isn’t particularly actionable. Is there anything else brands can or should be doing? I think it’s critically important for business owners to know their sites inside and out. That’s from a technical standpoint and a content standpoint (including advertising). That means continually crawling, auditing, evaluating, and refining the site. That’s the only way to ensure that quality problems don’t creep in. Also, technical problems could cause quality problems as well. For example, canonicalization problems, robots.txt issues, mobile problems, render problems, etc. can all impact SEO. If you are on top of the situation, then you can quickly rectify any issues that pop up. But if you’re not aware of them, then the problems will keep building until you get blindsided. And I’ve received many calls from business owners who have been blindsided by algorithm updates in the past. So, auditing content that gets published, educating writers, editors, and others that are in control of publishing content, crawling and auditing a site over time, reviewing links on a regular basis to ensure something funny isn’t going on, and then nipping any problems in the bud to ensure they don’t become bigger and scarier problems. That’s how you can protect your site from getting dinged during future algorithm updates. Looking forward, what is the #1 thing SEOs need to be thinking about as we move toward 2017? With so many changes and new things going on in SEO, it’s really hard to pick the number one area to focus on. That said, I’ll quickly cover two areas that webmasters need to be aware of. First, if Google keeps rolling out quality updates (Phantom), then webmasters should be keenly aware of those updates and the quality of their own sites. I covered this earlier, and it’s extremely important. We’ve seen quality updates roll out every few months, and the last was early September. So we will probably see another at the beginning of 2017 (just like last year). So keep your eye on Phantom. It’s certainly keeping its eye on you. 🙂 Next, and to state the obvious, mobile is booming. I have some clients with 80%+ mobile traffic. So staring at the beautiful desktop experience you are providing may not mean very much. I would make sure your mobile experience is as strong as possible. Google has a mobile-friendly algorithm, and it plans to incorporate mobile speed into the equation at some point. So I would start taking a hard look at how mobile users experience your website, how fast those pages load, if there are obstacles, etc. Also, accelerated mobile pages (AMP) started rolling out to the core mobile SERPs on 9/20. I think AMP should be an area that business owners take a hard look at, since amplified pages load near-instantaneously for mobile users and Google is pushing AMP hard. I’m not saying every site should jump on the AMP bandwagon, but business owners should evaluate its performance, how it works for users, how it impacts conversion, revenue, etc. And then there’s the mobile popup algorithm that’s rolling out in January of 2017. Many sites will be impacted by that, and some probably have no idea it’s coming. If a site is presenting popups or interstitials on the first page from the search results, then those pages could be demoted in the mobile search results. And popups and interstitials are used so heavily now by publishers that the algorithm will definitely impact many pages across the web. Therefore, I highly recommend that sites evaluate their use of popups and interstitials, make the necessary changes well ahead of January 1, 2017, and then be ready for the algo to roll out. One thing is for sure, it should be interesting. Great advice. Thanks for answering my questions, Glenn. See you in NYC!

Recording one solution to share lib between solr cores Introduction When using solr, you may want to share lib between cores, as solr cores may load different libs (configured with solrconfig.xml) with different class loaders. The problem is that they do not share class variables with each other, then you have to waste more space and spend more time to make distributed programs to work well with each other, e.g., word segmentation plug in loading dictionaries. Steps to Solve this Problem It takes a long time to find the answers by searching Google, as my keywords may not mean to the point. “solr classloader different core” are my keywords, focus on "classloader". If I changed to "share between cores", I may find the answer earlier. I doubt that I may have made some mistakes when configuring solr, but not. So I checked the solr source code in despair, and found that solr load libs for cores with different classloader indeed. By accident, I found some clauses in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-409, they do not solve my problem, but find my keywords from the issue topic "Allow configurable class loader sharing between cores". I should look for my answer from issues.apache.org first. After searching Google by new keywords, I found some solution from the results: Find a place inside the solr, before the core is created (if you want singletons you must load them outside of the core, using a parent classloader - in case of jetty, this means writing your own jetty initialization or config to force shared class loaders. or find a place inside the solr, before the core is created. Google for montysolr to see the example of the first approach) The solr config XML can now specify a libDir element (the same way the dataDir can be specified). That element can also specify through the 'shared' attribute whether the library is shared. By default, the shared attribute is true; if you specify a libDir, its class loader is made shareable. Syntax: <libDir shared='true*|false'>/path/to/shareable/dir</libDir> http://grokbase.com/t/lucene/solr-dev/07bc9zs7bt/jira-created-solr-409-allow-configurable-class-loader-sharing-between-cores I realize that solr may provide the ability for extending to meet my needs, it should and I believe it will. I turn to apache solr official documentation for a solution. When I search “apache-solr-ref-guide-5.5.pdf” with "shared", the answer comes up "For a multi-core configuration, you can specify sharedLib='lib' in the <solr/> section of solr.xml and place the necessary jar files there." "shared=> sharedLib => Multi-Core", in fact I searched multicore in pdf before, but not "multi-core" which may lead to the right answer. "multicore vs multi-core", they are different! The difficult course may be one of the reasons I write my experience in English here. Solution Specify sharedLib='lib'(default SOLR_HOME/lib, or your specified relative path) in the <solr/> section of solr.xml Modify your shell script and cp the necessary jar files (maybe placed under folder "global" or somewhere else) there.

Chris Griffith The Australian 12:00AM October 18, 2016 Save Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more... Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX Chris Griffith Technology reporter Sydney https://plus.google.com/116849779175391500455 @chris_griffith The Samsung Note7 battery saga is bad news for Samsung but Android overall is looking good with new premium handsets by Sony, Google and Motorola coming to market ahead of the Christmas rush. They each offer a different take on Google’s operating system. Sony Xperia XZ Sony Xperia XZ Sony is promoting the camera capability of this phone: a 23 megapixel main snapper, a 13MP low-light selfie front camera, 4K recording with image stabilisation, and a dedicated camera button. You pick up the phone, press and shoot, even with it locked. The back camera has three sensors: an image sensor, a laser autofocus sensor for measuring subject distance and an RGB sensor for colour accuracy. Predictive hybrid autofocus tracks subjects as they move across the frame. Sony says the camera works out the position of a moving object ahead of time so that it can take a sharp photo when it gets there. Sony also has introduced software that juices up a phone to 90 per cent overnight, and then charges it to 100 per cent before you get up. There is also Qnovo adaptive charging, which adjusts the charging rate. Sony says these measures double battery lifespan. The XZ is dust and water resistant. It has a 5.2-inch full HD display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 829 processor, 32GB of internal storage, a microSD card port and USB-C connector. Sony overlays “smart assist” technology over Google Android Marshmallow. Over time, this machine learning technology will glean your habits and alerts you to operating issues. Xperia XZ, sells in Australia from Thursday for $999. Google Pixel, Pixel XL Google's Pixel XL Google designed its new Pixel-branded phones from scratch and then got HTC to make them. The Pixel and Pixel XL have 5 and 5.5-inch displays respectively. Google, like Sony, promotes the quality of its 12.3MP and 8MP back/front facing cameras. The back snapper has a big f/2.0 aperture and large 1.55 micron pixels for capturing lots of light. In the smartburst feature, you can continually press the shutter button and the camera will take a series of photos and then select what it regards as the best and sharpest image. The “Lens blur” feature makes it easy to take shallow depth of field images so foreground subjects stand out. The standout feature is the integration of Google’s new assistant, found by holding down the Home button. It is capable of more natural, contextually based conversations, manages everyday tasks and you can tell it to display selected photos, such as “show me my cat photos from last year”. Possibly the most compelling feature is Google’s offer of free, unlimited online storage of your photos and videos. Pixel and Pixel XL have a high resolution AMOLED capacitive full HD display a USB Type-C connector and fast charging. As with last year’s Nexium models, the fingerprint reader is on the back. With Google branded phones you quickly get the latest version of Android (here Nougat). And it will work with Google’s virtual reality platform, Daydream View. Pixel, with a 5-inch screen with 32GB of storage, will cost $1079, or $1229 with 128GB storage. The larger Pixel XL, with a 5.5-inch screen, will cost $1269 (32GB) and $1419 (128GB). You can buy it outright through JB Hi-Fi or from Telstra on various plans. Available from Thursday. Moto Z, Moto Z Play Motorola Moto Z Motorola’s Moto Z is incredibly thin at just 5.2mm. Of the three phones here, it has the highest screen resolution, a 5.5-inch quad HD AMOLED display. It has a Qualcomm quad core processor, 32/64GB of internal storage and supports a whopping 2 Terabytes via a microSD card. If you don’t need the QuadHD screen, there’s Moto Z Play. The screen size is the same: 5.5 inches but it sports 1080p HD resolution. That trade-off isn’t so bad given you get a fast 8-core processor, and a 3510 milliampere hour battery that Motorola says will deliver up to 45 hours of mixed use and eight hours of use with 15 minutes of fast charging. Both phones make use of Motorola’s new magnetically attachable “Moto Mods”. You can clip on a stereo sound speaker, a projector, a “style shell” to boost its looks, a power pack for extra battery and a zoom lens, which delivers 10x optical zoom. Moto Z and Moto Z Play are available now for $999 and $699 respectively. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more...

However the clever A.I. assistant can be added to any Android Nougat device. But trust us, you probably don't want to try. By: Aaron BrownAaron Brown Published: Tue, October 18, 2016 EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSGoogle Assistant is a personified version of the Google Now panel – and is eerily accurate Google Assistant is one of the coolest features bundled with Google Pixel. The flagship new smartphone ships with the eerily-accurate assistant preinstalled – one of a handful of exclusive Android Nougat features included in the first phone to be "made by Google". In a nutshell, the Google Assistant is a personified version of the Google Now panel that has been a mainstay since Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. Google Assistant is summoned by saying "Ok Google" on pressing and holding on the Home Button at the bottom of the display.  Talking to the virtual Assistant takes the form of a text conversation, with speech bubbles displaying your questions and Google’s responses. It's fast – and rarely misunderstands you. GOOGLEUK customers can buy the Quite Black and Very Silver variations in store on October 20th Unfortunately, it looked like those who wanted to try-out Google Assistant would have to buy a Pixel or Pixel XL – or start using Google Allo as their default instant messaging app. However a number of users have claimed it is possible to add the futuristic virtual assistant to existing hardware by delving into root and bootloaders. Word of warning – only attempt this if you really know what you are doing. Google has not released an official tutorial to add Google Assistant to your Android smartphone, so you will be straying from the beaten track here. And on top of that – multiple reports have emerged from smartphone owners who have run into problems while attempting to bring Google Assistant to their non-Pixel device. If you are going to attempt the procedure – at least make sure you have an up-to-date backup. For our money, you're probably better off buying a Google Pixel. We were pretty impressed with the first "made by Google" phone, if you read our Hands On preview. But if you want to ignore the warnings and carry on, you'll also need to make sure you are running Android 7 Nougat.  Express.co.uk has compiled a list of the compatible devices, here. According to XDA user FaserF, who has created a video tutorial for the process, it is possible to add the Google Assistant to a phone without root access to the device. Avoiding root could be handy, especially if you want to get early access to updates via the Android Beta Program. 1. Uninstall the Google app from your device before proceeding with this method 2. Download these three .zip files and copy them to your phone’s internal storage 3. Reboot your phone into recovery mode 4. Navigate to Install within your custom recovery menu and install GoogleAssistantVelvet.zip and GoogleAssistantBuildProp.zip 5. After the installation finishes, reboot your device 6. Once your device reboots, you will need to manually grant permission to use the microphone and other accessories by heading to the Apps section of your Settings app 7. In the Settings app, find Google – tap Permissions and enable the necessary permissions 8. Long press on the virtual Home Button to summon the Google Assistant  Related articles Apple Store Regent Street reopening - First Look in new flagship shop Windows 10's next blockbuster update might FINALLY have a release date Amazon Echo Review - Lots of fun, not a lot of features for the price Windows 10 - Microsoft quietly added a brilliant new feature Latest videos ‘I’m going to think about it’ Trump CONFIRMS he could investigate Clinton over emails New Zealand rocked by ANOTHER earthquake just hours after fatal shock that killed two Man United ace trying to win back Jose Mourinho’s trust: This is what he wants to show Share Hunter: M&S announced clothing store closures to ensure a strong future Sainsbury's Christmas Advert 2016: Watch The Greatest Gift sung by James Corden here More Tech More Black Friday 2016 - Amazon sales begin TODAY and here's the best deals 3Comments Share Sony Xperia XZ review: A fabulous phone but it's missing a killer feature 0Comments Share Stop spam emails - here's how you can STOP being targeted by online scammers 6Comments Share Google Pixel - one of its best features can now be used on ANY Android device 0Comments Share Apple could be planning its BIGGEST iPad yet 1Comments Share Android Nougat update - now one of our favourite smartphones gets Google's new software 0Comments Share MacBook Pro 2016 deals - here is your last chance to get a cheap deal on Apple's laptops 1Comments Share Say hello to the next generation of emojis 2Comments Share BlackBerry WILL be releasing one last smartphone - with its iconic keyboard 6Comments Share Black Friday 2016: Amazon reveals all on its biggest EVER Christmas sale 0Comments Share More Tech More Black Friday 2016 - Amazon sales begin TODAY and here's the best deals 3Comments Share Sony Xperia XZ review: A fabulous phone but it's missing a killer feature 0Comments Share Stop spam emails - here's how you can STOP being targeted by online scammers 6Comments Share Google Pixel - one of its best features can now be used on ANY Android device 0Comments Share Apple could be planning its BIGGEST iPad yet 1Comments Share Android Nougat update - now one of our favourite smartphones gets Google's new software 0Comments Share MacBook Pro 2016 deals - here is your last chance to get a cheap deal on Apple's laptops 1Comments Share Say hello to the next generation of emojis 2Comments Share BlackBerry WILL be releasing one last smartphone - with its iconic keyboard 6Comments Share Black Friday 2016: Amazon reveals all on its biggest EVER Christmas sale 0Comments Share More Tech More Black Friday 2016 - Amazon sales begin TODAY and here's the best deals 3Comments Share Sony Xperia XZ review: A fabulous phone but it's missing a killer feature 0Comments Share Stop spam emails - here's how you can STOP being targeted by online scammers 6Comments Share Google Pixel - one of its best features can now be used on ANY Android device 0Comments Share Apple could be planning its BIGGEST iPad yet 1Comments Share Android Nougat update - now one of our favourite smartphones gets Google's new software 0Comments Share MacBook Pro 2016 deals - here is your last chance to get a cheap deal on Apple's laptops 1Comments Share Say hello to the next generation of emojis 2Comments Share BlackBerry WILL be releasing one last smartphone - with its iconic keyboard 6Comments Share Black Friday 2016: Amazon reveals all on its biggest EVER Christmas sale 0Comments Share SEARCH CONNECT WITH US Find us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Check us on Google+ Subscribe to our rss feed TODAY'S PAPER Monday, 14th November 2016 See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.

You’ll also find that, when it comes to content marketing, it’s much easier to repurpose old content than it is to create new content. One of the biggest problems faced by content marketers is coming up with new ideas. Although fresh content is certainly needed on a regular basis, recycled old content will often do wonders when you’re suffering from writer’s block and looking for ways to increase your reach. In fact, you should never forget about your old content. Every piece of content on your site is a representation of your brand. It can rank, get shared on social media, and convert. Editor Note: want to learn more about content marketing? Download our content marketing ebook. Here are a few ways you can repurpose some of your past content. 1. Convert it to Video (And Try Some of the New Formats) Your old content is probably a blog post containing mostly text. Use that text as narration or subject matter in a video. I do this all the time. Often, I will comb back through an old blog post and then create a video on the same topic. That video can then be used on that same page and add to the quality of the post. Creating the video is the hard part… Here are a few options. Cover main points in the blog and record your screen. This will allow you to show visuals online. Take the blog post and convert it into slides. Add photos to those slides and make a video in the webinar format. Turn the blog into a presentation and give the presentation on camera (you can use a whiteboard, projector or just wing it). Set up a camera and simply talk about the most important parts of the blog post. Do a Facebook Live recap of the post and save the recording (Periscope and Meerkat are also options). Once your video is complete and uploaded to YouTube (or another site such as Vimeo, Facebook, Tumblr, etc) you’re still not done. You are going to want to do the following. Embed the video on the original blog post (this will add to the quality of this post) Run ads for the video and the blog post on YouTube and Facebook Send the link to the blog or video out in your email newsletter Promote, promote, promote. 2. Make it an Infographic Everybody loves infographics. That’s because so many people are overworked and need to digest information as quickly as possible, preferably in visual format instead of lengthy, written text. Infographics win on both those points. They make it easy for readers to get a quick understanding of a subject while offering graphics that support and illustrate the main points. If you’ve got some great informational content that went viral in the past and you’re looking for a way to repurpose it, consider turning it into an infographic. It’s a good idea to review pages on your site that are ranking for large terms in Google, and review your top landing page reports in Google Analytics, and use that data to determine the largest opportunities. You might be concerned that you could have trouble creating an infographic because you’re not that good with graphics tools like Adobe Photoshop. If so, set your mind at ease. There are websites that will enable you to create a great infographic, even if you’re artistically challenged. For example, Piktochart makes it a snap to create high-quality infographics at an affordable monthly price. You can also try 99designs or hire someone on Upwork. There are also a number of free infographics tools that you can choose from. Keep in mind: with the prevalence of tools on the market, you’ll find it’s much easier to create infographics than videos. So, if time is of the essence in your situation, your best bet is probably to repurpose your content into infographic format as opposed to video format. Also, be sure to brand your infographic so that even when people copy just the image and post it on their own blogs, you’ll still be tooting your own horn. 3. Create a Listicle From Tags or Categories You’re probably using WordPress for your content marketing. You’ll find that it can be your very best friend when it comes to repurposing old content. That’s because WordPress allows you to tag and categorize blog posts (never use both, unless you want a duplicate content issue by the way). And, as a great digital marketer, you’ve been doing that with all of your posts for some time. Now, pick a tag or subject from your history of posts and take a go over the articles you’ve written. Look for a way to convert some of your old posts into listicle format. If you’re unfamiliar with the concept of a listicle: it’s an article in list format. It’s a concept popularized by sites like BuzzFeed. For example, if you have a blog about online marketing and one of your more popular tags is “social media,” you might find that you’ve written some very good articles about how to use social media for marketing over the past year. Make the topic of each one of those articles a point in your new listicle and include a synopsis of the original post. In this case, you might come up with a title like: “10 Social Media Strategies You Forgot to Use This Past Year (That Really Matter).” Each one of those 10 points is the subject of one of the articles you’ve already written. Bonus: when you repurpose your content with this method, you’ll also link back to the article that you originally wrote. That gives you a great excuse for some additional internal linkage. Google will jump back into those pages, crawl them again and give them a fresh boost. Even better, update the content on each of the posts you are linking to before you publish your listicle. That way you will see a big boost. 4. Convert it Into a SlideShare Presentation SlideShare might be one of the most under-utilized resources for digital marketers. That’s certainly not for lack of promotion – there are countless blog posts extolling the virtues of using SlideShare for brand promotion. And yet many people ignore it. If you’re looking for a great way to repurpose some old content into something that’s fresh and exciting, consider translating that old post into a SlideShare presentation. Slide presentations give you another great opportunity to educate people without requiring them to invest a lot of time reading a lengthy article. Great presentations offer only the most important points of a subject and back them up with stats, graphs, and images. You can also embed a SlideShare presentation just like you embed a YouTube video, image, or tweet. Just click the “Share” button at the bottom of the slideshow and copy the “Embed” code to your own blog. 5. Make it Into a Podcast If you’re looking for an astonishingly easy way to repurpose old content, consider using it in a podcast. Podcasts are popular with online marketers these days. That’s for a good reason: they give you an opportunity to boost your brand in a medium that people can use while occupied in some other way (like driving). One great way to get on the podcast map while simultaneously reusing old content is to record yourself reading a blog post and then use that recording in a podcast. That’s simple and inexpensive. Keep in mind, though, that if you don’t have a “radio voice,” you should consider getting somebody else to read your article for you. Sure, you’ll have to pay some cash for that, unless you have that talent in-house. You won’t have to pay much cash, though. There are people who do voice-overs on Fiverr for the unsurprising cost of $5. Hire them and you can outsource the whole thing. Neil Patel and Eric Siu have been doing this recently on Stitcher. Their new podcast is pretty good. 6. Use it in an Email Blast If you’re successful at email marketing, then you’re always signing up new people to your email list. Some of your more recent recruits might not be too familiar with the subjects covered in your older blog posts. That’s why it’s a great idea to repurpose old content and include it in an email that you send to all your followers. You’ll give the newbies a chance to get caught up on some of your older principles while reminding the veterans about what’s important. This is another easy way to repurpose. In many cases, it just involves copying and pasting old paragraphs and including a few relevant updates. Most smart marketers will create a drip campaign that sends out 5 to 20 of their best articles to new email subscribers over the course of a couple of months. This keeps the subscribers engaged and coming back to the site. 7. Aggregate Related Posts Into an E-Book Are you looking to establish yourself as an authority in your space with the publication of an e-book? If so, then you might find that task easier than you realize. Why? Because the book might already be written. In your own blog. Go through your past posts. Find related articles and aggregate them into one giant e-book. Make each post its own chapter in the book. See how easy that is? Of course, you’re not done once you’ve completed your copy-and-paste effort. You still want to invest some time and money into making your e-book look attractive. In the end, you can always upload your e-book to Amazon and either sell it or give it away. Best part, you get a link from Amazon and you can add your blogs RSS feed to the publisher area. I launched my first book on Amazon this year and it ended up being a great thing for our company. I was able to take most of my best work and merge it into one place. 8. Repost Evergreen Content on Social Media Do you have some fantastic evergreen content on your site that went viral a while ago? If so, there’s no reason why you can’t share it again. The best social media managers always tweet the best posts once every month or two. Why? They know it will always be a hit. You never let a good post die. You should always be refreshing and re-sharing. For example, if you invested $5,000 in writing the ultimate guide to content marketing and that article was a big hit with your audience, use your social media channels to re-post the link. Each time you share it, change the social media text a little and make sure to update the content on your guides quarterly at least. 9. Turn it Into a Webinar Another popular fad with modern digital strategists is the webinar. It’s also a great way to repurpose old content. If you’ve got a particularly popular and informative article on your blog, consider turning it into a webinar. Again: this is a great way to kill two birds with one stone. You’ll not only repurpose your old content, but you’ll also have great material for a successful webinar. The key to a successful webinar isn’t just the content, though. You’ll need to make sure that you promote it effectively. Otherwise, you’re going to be talking to yourself. Get Started Now You don’t have to struggle to find completely original content for every marketing channel. Instead, just repurpose some of your old content and share it in ways that you haven’t used before. Many of the really good marketers swear by this strategy. Personally, I am a big fan of it. Update your old content, repurpose your old content, and keep sharing it. Many times, this is a better option than simply creating something new.   Image Credits Featured Image: HappyCity/DepositPhotos.com In-post Photo #1: Image by John Lincoln In-post Photo #2: Image by John Lincoln All screenshots by John Lincoln.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael Cavna October 17 Follow @comicriffs From the new VR experience of “The Simpsons,” created in partnership with Google. (courtesy of FOX TV and Google) FIRST Pikachu, now Homer Simpson. Could SpongeBob or a Minion be next? Because iconic yellow cartoon characters will apparently be our highly visible guides into our techno-entertainment future. On Sunday night, just several months after virtual Pokemon took the real world by storm, we were treated to another step of cartoon trailblazing from the realm of VR. “The Simpsons” celebrated its 600th episode Sunday — a prime-time run second only to “Gunsmoke” in TV series history — and the show made the occasion especially memorable by opening with a couch gag that can now be viewed in 360-degree virtual reality. Powered partly by Google, the VR version of “Planet of the Couches” — an opening gag that’s a takeoff on “Planet of the Apes” — can be experienced on a mobile device and a $5 cardboard viewer. (Or as the “Simpsons” writers say: “Brought to you by the inevitable marriage of computers and cardboard!”) (courtesy of Fox TV and Google 2016) “We had this couch gag planned, and then we were approached by Google,” the show’s David Silverman, who directed the gag, tells The Post’s Comic Riffs. He says it was tricky to try to adapt this opening to the needs of VR immersion, but that Team Google — including Jan Pikaba and Karen Dufilho — helped put it all together, including the technical “scaffolding.” Google uses its trailblazing “Spotlight Stories” mobile experience to allow the viewer to scan the entire 360-degree scenes for visual jokes. In this case, it’s a land where humans are the enslaved, couches are the puffy overlords —- and Homer is our Charlton Heston, right down to the famed climax of a beach scene. “The Simpsons” meets “The Planet of the Apes” in a virtual-reality world. (courtesy of Fox TV and Google 2016) (Silverman notes that this marriage of technology and parody seems fitting, since “Planet of the Apes” itself felt like an effects breakthrough when it landed in 1968. That era’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” has also inspired “Simpsons” writers.) The “Simpsons” VR project certainly feels like a forerunner. Given the creative possibilities, TV series should flock to offering virtual-reality experiences — with animation neatly positioned to make the most of all the immersive potential.

Let's hear it for data over audio Kotkin: Why Trump won Analysis I remember when I first noticed “factivism”. It was more than 10 years ago. In 2003, Californian internet evangelists were still bruised by the dot.com implosion when the United States invaded Iraq on a bogus pretext, WMDs. The web evangelicals thought: wait a minute. The Internet (PBUI) is a Good Thing. The Internet delivers information, and it’s where people talk so nicely to each other. Couldn’t The Internet have stopped this terrible thing? Inspired by this, Silicon Valley’s best known newspaper tech pundit left his job to become a preacher, and “factivism" became a big part of his sermons. Dan Gillmor’s We The Media imagined real-time fact-checking during Presidential Debates. "I would prefer to see TV networks flash corrections on the screen as soon as they caught the candidate in a lie. Distracting? Perhaps, but maybe the candidates would lie less often or at least less brazenly,” Gillmor wrote. "Even more valuable would be giving the candidates more tools to correct each other. I would build a personal computer into each podium, connected to whatever online resources the candidate and his staff found useful." We care a lot ... from the sofa This drew from the ancient positivist idea that facts would triumph over the lived experience, combined with a modern faith in crowdsourcing. Thanks to the internet, the "Wise Crowd" could play a role in checking the facts, and naturally bloggers got very excited by this: they could play an important role in civic life without having to leave the sofa. So bloggers got very excited by this. You can see why they hoped this might work. The US press picks two (and only ever) two sides to a story and studiously transcribes everything each side says, so if one side is simply making stuff up, then those “contaminating" factoids never go away. Gilmor eventually recanted his belief in factivism, but at Google, the faith burns bright. A year ago Google floated the idea that it should now act as an arbiter, a kind of Ministry of Truth, by ranking search results according to its own metric of accuracy. Now, just in time for the 2016 Elections, Google News is going to give factivism a lift by promoting “fact checking” sites into news clusters, and giving "fact checking” stories a special tag. The tag will indicate that you can believe the tagged stories a bit more than you can the others. Not surprisingly, this has caused some disquiet. For a start, “fact checking” sites are just a bit more subtle about advancing an agenda than other PR or activism hubs. Is it sufficient to self-certify as a fact-checking site to gain the promotion, and boost in attention? Who checks the fact checkers? One fatal flaw is that it supposes the existence of a Brahmin caste, a Priesthood of dispassionate fact-checkers, who will deliver a verdict everybody will trust. Such a Priesthood doesn’t exist, and given what a decade of dubious appeals to authority, with the media complicit in these exaggerated and often apocalyptic tales - people are not likely trust what it says anyway. Another is a consequence that in largely rhetorical debates, most of the assertions will be er,... rhetorical. So what purports "fact checking" turns out to be a straightforward contestation, and often a childish contestation at that. This widely derided example from Comcast’s NBC News illustrates this: You don’t bring fact-checking to a figure of speech. This pearl from Politifact (“Winner of the Pulitzer Prize”) is even more pointless. Why even bother? Just saw some fact-checks about my candidate, off to change my vote - said no one ever Trump may be the catalyst for Google’s initiative, but the explosion of positivism fact-checking Trump is an exercise in political powerlessness. Trump really could not care less about his Truth-O-Meter rating. Trump’s demagoguery wasn’t created by a lack of factivist blogs, and it won’t be beaten by a better Truth-O-Meter. Trump got as far as he did because the main parties had stopped listening to people’s concerns, in preference for the country clubs, Wall Street and gestures politics. (Both main US parties are guilty of all indulging in all three). Over decades, politics became about talking at people, in the belief that humans can "be engineered and corrected by instruction from their enlightened betters”, as Daniel Bell wrote in The Coming of Post-Industrial Society. As thoughtful writers have pointed out, the political class left a vacuum. Trump may have brought about the overdue collapse of the Republican Party, but the other shoe has yet to drop; it surely must with a Democratic President who tells Wall Street that politicians need two faces: a public and a private position on issues. Factivism is really a retreat from political engagement, and deserves to be synonymous with civic inaction. If you think it’s the answer: I confidently predict more Trumps. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 54 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

The first in that series was Huawei Nexus 6P. Incidentally, the second one - and that is this piece - also features a Huawei phone. Although, unlike the Nexus 6P there are differences. The Honor 8 is not as good as the Nexus 6P, a phone Huawei made in collaboration with Google, but it is cheaper and it is new. Once, again I must add that for the phones featuring here in this series, this piece is not a camera review. The images, that you see here, have been edited to taste using Adobe Lightroom and Google Nik Software. Instead of a review, this is more of a demonstration of what sort of images you can hope to capture with Honor 8, complete with a bit of editing. But review or not, it is also true that any phone featuring here has a camera that is above average. Any phone that is not capable of clicking some decent photos will not find a place here in the "Smartphone With Best Camera Series". Also Read: Huawei Honor 8 review: All-rounder with a dash of style With that out, what exactly can you capture with Honor 8? Pretty great pics, unless you don't try low light photography. Honor 8 camera In terms of camera hardware, the Honor 8 is pretty well equipped. Although it is, on paper, not as good as the Huawei P9, a phone that has a lens designed by Huawei in partnership with Leica. But it does have the same Sony-made IMX 286 sensors. In fact, just like how P9 has them, the Honor 8 too has two of these sensors, with one capturing colour photos while the other one clicking monochrome - black and white images. What's good about Honor 8 camera -- The performance in good light is fantastic. It capture good details and great colours. -- The auto-focus is very fast and can handle hyperactive pets. With little effort you can click blur-free images of a dog or cat. -- There are a tons of filters which can be accessed easily. -- The camera handles dynamic light with ease and expertly.

Compared to its peers, Honor 8 falls short in low light. -- The HDR mode is not available in auto. It has to be manually toggled and that in a phone as expensive as Honor 8 is clearly a big miss.

Just in time for the Holiday shopping season, Acer updates its Chromebook 15 lineup with new models that include a large 15.6-inch display, now at a more affordable starting price of only $199. The Acer Chromebook 15 CB3-532-C47C, is available at Walmart priced at $199. How To: Find Nintendo NES Classic In Stock In addition to providing a large HD display, the new model Acer Chromebook 15 (CB3-532) delivers up to 12 hours of battery life for fun and productivity that lasts beyond work and school into the evening. The Chromebook 15 (CB3-532) is slated to provide additional capabilities thanks to planned support for Android apps via the Google Play Store. “The new Acer Chromebook 15 is going to be a big hit with holiday shoppers this year – it combines the most sought-after features – a large display and incredibly long battery life – at a price that makes it a desirable and affordable gift,” said Chris Chiang, AVP Mobility, Acer America. “The Acer Chromebook 15 was a game-changer when it debuted in 2015 – and now we’re able to provide the winning combination of large display, long battery life and affordable price to even more customers.” According to data from Gartner, Acer Group is the world’s leading Chromebook brand with over 33 percent market share in 2015. The Acer Chromebook 15’s 15.6-inch display makes viewing websites, video and games even more enjoyable. The large size also increases productivity by giving customers additional real estate to view multiple tabs and apps. The LED backlit Acer ComfyView display has an HD 1366x768 resolution with anti-glare properties that minimize the amount of reflecting light for less strain on the eyes. To complement the large display, the Acer Chromebook 15 has two full-sized upward facing speakers and high-definition audio support. The speakers provide enhanced volume and audio range, resulting in more realistic and immersive multimedia, games and music. The display is ideal for use with the HD web cam with high dynamic range imaging support to provide clear, crisp video for video chats and Google Hangouts. The large display makes room for a roomy full-sized keyboard as well as a large touchpad, so customers have greater freedom when navigating, zooming and scrolling. Customers will be able to enjoy all-day productivity, fun and enjoyment; the Acer Chromebook 15 provides up to 12-hours of battery life. This exceptionally long battery life is ideal for students, families, and anyone who plans to use their Chromebook on the go, around the office or at home. Acer’s newest Chromebook delivers solid performance for running multiple apps, websites and online games. It is powered by an Intel Celeron N3060 processor and has fast eMMC storage for fast boots and saving data locally. The Acer Chromebook 15 also comes with 100GB of Google Storage, so customers have ample room to save their documents, photos and more. Storage on Google Drive protects files, documents, and photos safely in the cloud, and ensures that the most current version of the file or document is always available and safe, even if the Chromebook is lost or stolen. Running on Chrome OS, the Chromebook 15 is great for a range of customers who view, edit, create and collaborate both on-line and off-line using Office documents and Gmail. Chromebooks are simple to use and ideal for sharing by multiple users, since users can log into their own account to access Docs, website bookmarks and other information. Security is a key benefit of the Chrome OS, as it’s automatically updated to guard against ever-changing online threats. In addition, the Supervised Users feature helps get children online in a safe, controlled way. Since Chrome OS is continually updated, new features are always being added. The Chromebook 15 (CB3-532) is scheduled to receive updates that will allow the installation of Android apps via the Google Play Store. The Acer Chromebook 15 keeps customers in touch with up to three times faster wireless connectivity with 802.11ac WiFi(4) (4)  featuring MIMO 2x2 technology (dual band 2.4GHz and 5GHz). Also, customers can connect other peripherals to it via Bluetooth 4.2, two USB 3.0 ports, and an HDMI port. The SD card reader supports up to 128GB SDXC for transferring and saving files. The Chromebook 15 has been reinforced to handle more bumps and drops; the case can withstand up to 132 pounds (60kg) of force, while the corners can tolerate up to 23.6 inch (60 cm) drops without damage. It weighs 4.3 pounds (1.95 kg) and measures 15.08 W x 10.08 D x 0.95 H inches (383 W x 256 D x 24.2 H mm). The Acer Chromebook 15 (CB3-532) is available now at leading electronics retailers in North America.. It has an HD display, 2GB of SDRAM, 16GB internal storage and is powered by an Intel Celeron N3060 dual-core processor.

However, the problem with following a lot of metrics is that it can become very easy to not pay close attention to any of them, and isn’t the whole point of following metrics so that you know exactly what’s going on with your startup? Metrics have the potential to offer a ton of insight into your successes and failures, but only if you know which ones to track without getting overwhelmed. That’s why we’ve compiled this list of 10 important marketing metrics that every new start-up owner should master: 1) Web traffic: what kind and where is it coming from? Image credit and all subsequent image credits: Google Analytics Web traffic is essentially a blanket category that encompasses the majority of the metrics listed below; making it one of the most important measures that startup owners should be analyzing. In addition, increased web traffic generally means increased sales and revenue, which is hopefully your goal as a business owner. But before you can jump for joy at the overwhelming amount of traffic that’s being directed to your site, you need to figure out what types of leads are worth investing in and which ones are paying off so you know how to drive traffic using the most cost effective means available. Several important aspects of web traffic will be discussed below, but for now think about: how much of your traffic is paid, and what is the return on investment (ROI) on that? How much traffic comes from organic searches? How much traffic comes from social media, and is it due to actions you’re doing (like tweeting) or the actions of others (like shares)? How much traffic is generated through email? Read below to learn more details about these specific measures, most of which can be analyzed through Google Analytics. 2) Keyword ranking While the importance of optimized keywords might be old news for seasoned business owners, it’s something that new startups need to grasp, and quickly. Choosing appropriate keywords is one of the quickest and most valuable ways to get your business ranked high on Google and other top search engines, thus getting the word out that your site contains worthwhile content. A good way to figure out how well your content is performing is by monitoring the success (or lack thereof) of your keywords. You can do this through Google Analytics by creating a custom search that can tell you how your content responds to different keyword searches. This article from searchenginewatch.com discuses how to improve your Google ranking signals by focusing on keywords. 3) Social media reach and shares Social media is still easily one of the best ways to market your small business, startup or not. Utilizing sites like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, and more gives you the potential to reach over 1.8 billion people worldwide—a pretty big number of potential customers and revenue. Thus, social media reach and shares is a great metric to monitor so that you can determine if you’re using the platforms to your benefit. As I said before, when you’re looking at social media you need to figure out what traffic stems from your actions vs. the actions of others, and then capitalize on whatever method works best for your particular business. Shares in particular are a good way to gauge how valuable others find your content to be; the more shares you receive, the better your content, and the more people will get to view it. Obviously you want your social reach to extend as far as possible, so try to determine what action words and images engage your audience the most. 4) Cost of leads and lead generation In addition to social media, another way to determine if your audience finds your website content valuable is by tracking where your leads come from. Pay attention to where your customers are coming from and what content is engaging them to visit your site, and then determine if the cost you’re spending on leads (assuming you are paying for them) is worth the return on investment. Furthermore, ROI is directly linked to returning visitors (discussed below). One thing to keep in mind before scrutinizing lead metrics is that you first need to determine one action to analyze at a time, such as email signups or purchases. Focusing on one desired customer action at a time will prevent your results from becoming skewed. 5) Return on investment The success or failure of a startup could all come down to ROI. Is the money you’re putting into your business generating enough profit to make your efforts worth it, or are you losing money? Definitely don’t skip out on ROI metrics or you could be throwing money down the drain without even realizing it. Unfortunately, while ROI is one of the most important metrics to calculate, it’s also one of the most difficult. Louder Online suggests measuring “the cost per piece of content, the website traffic it produces, the leads generated by a piece of content, and how much each visitor to your site is worth in terms of potential sales.” Couldn’t have said it better myself!

Chances are, if visitors continue to return to your website they are more likely to eventually make a purchase, or multiple purchases. That’s why it’s important to track who these return customers are, as well as where they’re coming from (see number 4). Furthermore, multiple visitors are what cause a new customer to become a loyal one, and one you should incorporate into (and market to) your target audience. If you’re not seeing a large number of return visitors, think about changing the content on your site. 7) Customer acquisition cost It’s not just returning customers that should be analyzed. Startup owners should also be looking at what it costs to attract new customers. You can’t have a returning customer that wasn’t at one time a new customer, right? Make sure you’re thinking about the full cost of acquiring new customers, ie: referral fees, discounts, and anything else you used to try to attract a new audience. Neil Patel believes that the equation to calculate the cost of new customers is relatively simple. Just “divide the marketing department’s monthly budget with the amount of new customers acquired that month, [and] you’ll understand how much you need to spend to convince a visitor to become a paying customer.” In addition, Kissmetrics goes into more detail on exactly how to determine CaC and why it’s a valuable metric for your business. 8) Email performance and conversion rate Email is a great way to market for a target audience, just make sure you’re keeping track of how many emails you’re sending out and who you’re sending them to so you can rate their effectiveness. It’s not a bad idea to include a call-to-action in your email campaign as well, prompting receivers to visit your website and/or make a conversion. If you choose to do this, make sure you note how many people actually click on the link provided in the email (this will be discussed more in number 9), and furthermore how many go on to make a conversion once they’ve done so. Once again, the article mentioned above suggests dividing the number of recipients by the number of responders to get a rough estimate on how effective your email campaign is. In addition, you may want to keep track of the unsubscribe rate as well, and definitely don’t make the mistake of including those who have unsubscribed when you calculate your percentage for new web traffic. 9) Click-through rate (CTR) Your click-through rate stems from how many people choose to click on a link you post via social media or through online advertisements. It’s important to track this individual metric because it represents the success of your content’s first impression, according to WordStream. Click through rates are directly linked to your content headlines, images, titles, and anything else that users see immediately. If your rates are high, chances are this part of your content is successful; if your rates are low, consider changing one or more of these aspects to encourage users to click on your content. Keep in mind, however, that high click through rates aren’t that great if all they’re doing is bringing disinterested people to your website. Definitely track this metric in conjunction with conversion rates so that you can see how many people who click and visit your site actually end up making a purchase. This article from SEW gives great understanding into more ways you can gain insights from consumers’ click histories, and this one explains how to improve your CTR using the Google Search Console. 10) Pageviews and landing page conversion rate One last thing you definitely want to monitor (and can, via Google Analytics) is your landing page conversion rates. Most likely you’re going to have pages that outperform others, and it’s important to know which ones are which so that you can make the necessary improvements. Google Analytics allows you to check both your keyword performance (explained further in number 2) as well as your landing page traffic. Some pages you might want to keep an eye on include your home page, contact page, about page, blog home, and any blog posts, among others. Again, Google Analytics can provide data on which pages see the most amount of traffic, and you can use this info to determine what content is most popular with your target audience. You can also analyze your bounce rate (aka the number of people who leave your site immediately after visiting it) and the time users spend on each page together to get a good idea of what type of visitor is attracted to your site and what they’re looking for. Hopefully now you have a good idea of what type of metrics to get started analyzing for your startup, and you know how to use this valuable data in order to understand your consumers and translate web traffic into conversions.

 Apple wants to use AI to turbo-charge your iPhone's battery life Rob Price Oct. 17, 2016, 7:35 AM 3,234 facebook linkedin twitter email print Will Wei/Business Insider Apple wants to use artificial intelligence (AI) to turbo-charge the battery life of your iPhone. In an interview with The Nikkei Asian Review published Monday, CEO Tim Cook said that the company is looking at integrating AI technology across its products to improve them. While the tech is most commonly associated with chatbots like Apple's Siri or Google's Assistant, it can be used "in ways that most people don't even think about," Cook said. A key example he gave was making your devices last longer in between charges: "We want the AI to increase your battery life." Earlier this year, Google announced it had integrated AI into its power-hungry data centres — and it managed to produce savings of up to 40% by automatically figuring out the most efficient way to run things. Apple (and others) could try and achieve similar gains in smartphones and other commercial devices by using AI to optimise battery life and reduce power consumption. Battery life is a constant pain for just about every smartphone on the market. The iPhone lasts around a day, and even the most energy efficient consumer devices only last 2 or 3 — far less than dumbphones from before the smartphone era, that could last a week or so on a single day. The race for ever-thinner and more-powerful devices means that any gains in energy efficiency or battery tech from year to year typically just result in more features being crammed into a device, rather than meaningful improvements in battery life. As such, any improvements — whether from AI, or anywhere else — will be sure to be welcomed by consumers. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Skip to content Home Menu Reverse Engineering using Chrome Viacheslav in Uncategorized October 17, 2016October 20, 2016 1,361 Words As you may get already I am a curious person, my desire is always to know how things work. That’s why today we are going to debug “The New York Public Library” gallery. By using Chrome browser we intend to find out how the part of the detailed preview is implemented. And after that, we will create an application which will help us to get the chosen image in a better quality – deal? This current example appeared here only because I was searching a head image for my About page. I was thinking – Hm… The development of some New York’s bridge would perfectly fit here, – because I am an engineer and figuratively speaking I build them every day, right? Where can I get it from though? I tried to Google and I have found a web-site called “The New York Public Library: Digital Collections” after a few minutes of staring at the photos, I found out that it doesn’t let you download this particular image in a good resolution. I was devastated. – but wait a minute… Why can I preview it in a good quality then? – I thought about Google, they didn’t let my Ruby gem to live for long. Their developers have invented the algorithm that lets them create a special token to validate the request later… Then I was thinking about their backend and I have questioned myself whether they have implemented this algorithm also there? – How do they reuse it, do they? Anyways I quickly looked at the Network session of my browser to understand what does it do when I click every time on the detailed preview… – It wasn’t unexpected though, I knew it has to fetch it from somewhere. And yes, it was downloading particular tile of image every time I was scrolling the page. I looked over it and thought – Ah, okay. It makes sense… Although I don’t have an Adobe Photoshop to gather all of them… And by the way, how you guys separate your image? There must be some rule behind. And happily it turned out at least for this photo, – it was true. My assumptions were correct, it seemed that by path I can request particular image that interest me at most, – the tile of it if to be more precise. So by changing in the path of URL – /0/A/B.png the value A I could change zoom of picture and by changing B I could select a distinct tile I wanted to download. By a quick scroll over them I understood that on the zoom categorised by 11 number, I have only 5 tiles horizontally (from 0 to 4) and 3 vertically (0-2). I decided to write a script. Nevertheless a quick notice, of course I could do that only by using CURL or any other tool, however my idea was to cover the whole process from debugging until the automation of the steps and of course sharing it with you. – If you like the time I have invested on this article leave your likes and comments below – I would highly appreciate that. We want our script or program if you will, to work just like the browser, right? – What can help us achieve this goal? Yes, it’s net/http library, although I don’t want to waste my time on building the abstraction around Net::HTTP and gonna use here the open-uri which is a simple wrapper that will allow me to get away from writing many code lines and to continue watching the Netflix with my girlfriend. So let’s implement the first parts of our program. First of all we want to declare in the initialise method the arguments which are id of the image and the dimension of it, we could automate this part either – in order to avoid entering the dimension by hand every time, but I think I will go with the easiest way for now. I define a private method that will help us to form the right url and fetch the correct tile in part of our algorithm. The rest of our file is the publicly available, – save method of our class, which consist of the algorithm that basically saves the images on our computer. – Easy! The first part of our program is complete, let’s go ahead and execute the program and see what happens. (Source code: Step 1) Hold on! – You’ve said we are going to download the full picture and not some useless pieces of it! You may complain… And you would be right – But in fact what’s left so far is to merge the images together. In order to do that we are going to use rmagick gem. I will need to use Magick::ImageList.new for this purpose and depends whether I need to combine them vertically or horizontally apply the flag for append method. In few words, we are combining saved image – vertically and then perform the same action horizontally, plus we’re removing the trash left from the previous steps so by the end of this operation we’re getting the image with name of id we passed at the beginning. – This implementation is ugly… Because first of all it doesn’t make any sense to store all the files and then to remove them, although it helped me to debug the process. But yes, let’s remove the download method in the line where we used to save the file, instead of loading a file, we can pass the downloaded image as a String by using from_blob method. And absolutely the same we are doing for images that were combined vertically. For us it’s just enough to get the Array of resulted image_list.append(true) objects and by combining vertical results to get the whole picture. Let’s take a look of what we’ve got now (Source Code: Step 2) And Voilà! Thanks to computer science, we actually were able to produce all the steps backwards in order to get the result – cool… Nevertheless, what could be better? I think – the main algorithm that lets you download the tiles, plus it would be a lot nicer to run it in loop and try to save the images without knowing the number of tiles. All I want to pass the N of zoom and patiently wait… And that’s why we get rid of upto iterator here and go with an infinite loop that I break if only I get the empty array. In other words, I stop constantly going over and over again because I know if there is an empty collection or the set of data if you will, it’s only because nothing have been downloaded. – If nothing was appeared in the list now, – Why to go any further by trying to get something else? You can’t get a raster picture like this which has missed spot. In the worst scenario, it would be white, black or even transparent. Anyways in example below where you can see X’s – they mean a missed piece. But are they still the part of the digital image? – Of course they are! ######## ####XXXX ######## Therefore if data set consist of the other tiles, we retry loop from the beginning hence to download other parts of the vertical set, otherwise we stop the program. The final source code can be found here. You’re welcome to modify and fork the program. It also would be a pleasure if you would help me to share and to make this article more popular. It would definitely help me to keep myself motivated and to keep you up fresh with a more interesting material. Important: The idea behind this article is to show how to debug a website with educational purpose using Chrome browser. Then how to build an algorithm to download and merge the tiles. On the resource mentioned here you can download pictures in a good resolution such like head image of this article. Thank you for your time! Happy coding and leave comments below, cheers! P.S.

(Reuters/Stephen Lam) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong Obsession Borders October 17, 2016 Google is doubling down on its submarine cable investments in the Pacific ocean, this time with Facebook’s backing. The two tech companies announced last week (Oct. 12) that they are joining a consortium to build a new transpacific submarine cable system that will be ready in 2018. The project, known as the Pacific Light Cable Network, will be the largest-capacity transpacific link when it’s operational, with a bandwidth of 120 terabits per second. It will stretch 12,800km between Manhattan Beach, in Los Angeles, California, and Tseung Kwan O, in Hong Kong. The planned cable has double the capacity of the current largest pipe under the Pacific, the FASTER cable system, which Google also invested in. Neither Google nor Facebook disclosed the amount they are investing, but the project costs $400 million in total, according to the consortium’s other partners, TE Connectivity and China Soft Power Technology Holding, when the project was first announced (pdf) last November. The Pacific is seeing a boom in submarine-cable construction. Nearly $1.5 billion has been committed to submarine routes there between 2016 and 2018, making it among the world’s most heavily invested regions for new fiber-optic bandwidth, according to data from research firm TeleGeography (pdf). It’s part of a wider trend of internet infrastructure investment in Asia outpacing other regions. The new cable project contributes to another infrastructure trend, where content-owners like Google and Facebook increasingly build their own pathways to their end-users to cater to explosive demand for bandwidth-intensive content, such as video streams. The amount of traffic that flows over these privileged links has grown so great that it has altered the structure of the internet itself, in a phenomenon known as the “flattening” of the internet. Facebook teamed up with Microsoft in May to build a new transatlantic cable, dubbed Marea, that connects Bilbao in Spain to Virginia in the United States. Google says it’ll use the capacity from its new Hong Kong-LA cable to serve its Google Cloud Platform customers. The new bandwidth could accommodate 80 million simultaneous high-definition video calls between the two regions, the company said in a blog post. Video-heavy data links are precisely what the world’s biggest tech companies are preparing for, and why they’ll continue to own more of the internet’s infrastructure.

Pixel is well placed to fill the Android flagship void vacated by Samsung’s discontinued Galaxy Note 7. We’re looking forward to doing some real-world testing on the camera after Google made such a big deal out of its 89 DxOMark Mobile score, the highest ever on a smartphone. Pixel is also the first phone to feature the Google Assistant. And remember that Google’s $79 Daydream View VR headset will available for preorder on Thursday when you’re picking up that new Pixel. Tuesday marks the start of Vanity Fair’s third annual New Establishment Summit. According the event’s website, "The summit brings titans of technology, politics, business, media, and the arts for inspiring conversations on the issues and innovations shaping the future." This year’s lineup of speakers includes Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Uber’s Travis Kalanick, Disney’s Bob Iger, Apple’s Eddie Cue, and Pixar’s John Lasseter to name just a few. Proof of life on Mars With any luck, Wednesday will see the ExoMars mission land the Schiaparelli module on the surface of Mars. Schiaparelli separated from the Trace Gas Orbiter on Sunday. Together, the two spacecraft are hoping to prove that life exists — or has existed — on the Red Planet. Wednesday is also the day that Elon Musk is promising a Tesla announcement. Originally scheduled for today, Musk took to Twitter last night to say it would move to Wednesday because whatever is coming "needs a few more days of refinement." Rumors are swirling of an Apple event scheduled for next week. If true we should see the press invites go out over the next few days for what’s expected to be a long overdue refresh of the company’s Macs, including the MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and iMac. Bloomberg’s also saying to expect a new 5K monitor built in collaboration with LG. Volvo’s parent company, Geely of China, will be launching its new Lynk & Co car brand on Thursday. According to Autoweek, lynk & Co will launch with both a sedan and SUV built upon the bones of Volvo’s compact modular architecture. This week also marks the return of earnings season. On deck are Netflix and IBM on Monday, followed by Yahoo on Tuesday, eBay on Wednesday, and then Verizon and Microsoft on Thursday.

Written by Guest author 17 October 2016 @ 12:15 In the final instalment of this three-part series exploring the disruptive potential of Google’s aggregated MVNO Project Fi, Devicescape CEO Dave Fraser considers the possibility of a radical plan to embed Fi-style functionality into all Android smartphones. Whatever you might believe about the potential impact of Google’s Project Fi on the mobile establishment, one thing is certain: Google — one of the world’s most powerful and successful agents of change — looked at the mobile industry and saw an opportunity to innovate and disrupt. It saw an industry which excels at delivering complex technology evolution but also one in structural stasis; its core operational model unchanged for decades. By stating its intention to push the boundaries of possibility in smartphone connectivity, Google disclosed its assessment that nobody else was pushing those boundaries. Google’s big idea — that a connectivity service built from multiple, overlapping resources should be inherently superior in terms of coverage and capacity — is nothing new. But its execution of that idea, using software to build an aggregated network, is momentous. The result is a network greater than the sum of its parts; immediately on a part with much larger competing networks. Compare this to the processes by which mobile operators amalgamate networks, either through sharing arrangements or as part of costly, time-consuming M&A activity. The aim in these instances, the metric by which success is judged, is almost always the removal of network assets; the eradication of overlapping capacity. These are radically different philosophies. In the first two instalments in this series exploring Project Fi, we looked at what Google’s MVNO might mean for operators and smartphone vendors. We sought to gauge the extent of the threat it represents to the industry’s balance of power. The great unknown in this process, of course, is Google’s appetite for expansion. Does Google really want to strike multiple wholesale deals and create consumer propositions and customer service organisations in already competitive mobile markets around the world? Maybe, maybe not. But the more interesting question is whether it even needs to. As we have already suggested, Google’s intent with Project Fi might simply be to show that it can be done, clearing a path for other service providers to launch similarly aggregated connectivity plays. If Google wanted to make it easy for others to replicate Project Fi, though, it would need to give them more than evidence it was possible; it would need to give them the tools to do it themselves. So here’s an idea which might seem fanciful but which is entirely within the realm of possibility: Maybe Google will simply embed the network selection capabilities at the heart of the Project Fi service into the Android OS. Hundreds of millions of Android devices would have the ability to switch between competing mobile networks, and public Wi-Fi, automatically and at will. To paraphrase a popular meme: “We are Android. You will be aggregated. Resistance is Futile.” Imagine the potential for existing MVNOs, and adjacent service providers looking to add mobility to a bundle. Imagine the impact on mobile operators’ longstanding control over device supply: Why would anyone buy a smartphone from an operator if it were not tied to that operator? Why not just buy it directly from the manufacturer? Imagine the effect this inherent capability could have on the battle between Android and iOS. There is a precedent in the shape of Google’s extension of Wi-Fi Assistant to all Nexus devices, announced in August. Wi-Fi Assistant, also present in the Pixel range which launched earlier this month and will replace the Nexus brand, automatically connects devices to available public Wi-Fi deemed acceptable by Google. It highlights the reality that the handset is the best place to make decisions about the quality of available connectivity, and reminds us that ever more power is in the operating system, and in the hands of the consumer. Not everyone believes Project Fi will have a lasting impact. For some the momentum of the mobile operator establishment appears impossible to stop. But great momentum also makes it difficult to change direction, even in the face of sudden and urgent need. How many of you used Nokia handsets once upon a time? How many of you still do? Great momentum has made it difficult for operators to innovate in the service. That momentum has opened the door to Google, Facebook, Apple and many other digital disruptors with intensely loyal customer bases and almost unimaginably deep pockets. These are entities with resources and philosophies which fuel endless experimentation, the results of which cannot be put back in the box. Google has created a mobile connectivity service which has multiple networks clamouring to carry its bags. It has done so because, first, no single network can provide all of the connectivity the user needs all of the time and, second, because doing so weakens the position of its wholesale providers. It is an idea which we believe will prove highly contagious, and quick to spread. Industry thinking must evolve such that any network comes to be understood as only one underlying component of a connectivity service. Much as operators move customers onto other mobile networks when they roam, so they must look to extend their service to other available networks wherever it benefits the consumer to do so. Just as important, they must find ways to derive additional benefits and revenues from doing so for themselves. After all, Google makes money from every network which carries its services and advertising. Operators must choose whether they want to offer a service which is bigger than their network, or simply contribute a network to third parties with altogether bigger ideas about service.   Also in this series: Part 1 – Project Fi: Google’s Mobile Master Plan Part 2 – Project Fi: Assistance Is Fruitful   Dave Fraser has been designing, building, marketing, and managing software for more than 30 years. He was instrumental in the development of Devicescape’s Curated Virtual Network and the connectivity, engagement and insight services it enables for operators, app developers, and consumer brands. Prior to joining Devicescape, Dave worked for Wind River (acquired by Intel), holding a variety of executive positions including chief marketing officer, and senior VP product business. He previously held senior roles at Convergent Technologies and Hewlett-Packard.   Tags: Devicescape, featured, Google, Project Fi One comment Steve Smith 18/10/2016 @ 7:46 pm Reply Google allows our smartphones to be truly smart.

Earlier this year Google was given permission by the US to test its delivery drones on 6 different sites, while the idea of an Amazon delivery drone has been established for quite some time. Singapore post has also experimented with delivering mail from mainland Singapore to Pulau Ubin. These 3 drone services – among others – have experimented with drones that can land at both ends of the journey. However, they have been beaten to the commercial drone finish line. Last week it was revealed that the world’s first regular commercial drone delivery service began operations in Rwanda. Zipline is the US start-up running the project. The company is made up of engineers who formerly worked at Space X, Google, Lockheed Martin and other tech companies. It uses fixed-wing drones, designed like miniature planes, that fly automatically to destinations throughout Rwanda. Once at the delivery areas location, the small packages being carried are released and, attached to a parachute, gently land at the delivery point. A Zipline drone releasing a package mid-flight This method is unlike efforts attempted by other drone delivery services, like DHL, Amazon, or Singapore Post, that want their drones to be able to land at the delivery endpoint. The use of the drones, however, combined with them not having to land will dramatically speed up delivery times. Equally, “this avoids the risk of recipients getting in the way of rotating blades,” said Dr Ravi Vaidyanathan, from Imperial College London. “So long as there is no prospect of a plane falling from the sky and there is no danger posed by a package dropping on to anyone, then this sounds like a positive environment to begin drone deliveries.” Initially, the drones will be used to deliver blood, plasma, and coagulants to hospitals across rural western Rwanda, helping to cut waiting times from hours to minutes, and potentially saving lives. Zipline will be paid by Rwanda’s health department on a per delivery basis, with the cost a similar price to road-vehicle delivery methods. “While delivery drones don’t tackle the underlying problem of Africa’s need for better roads and transport networks, they can deliver critical medicines and supplies to remote villages in countries such as Rwanda while surveyor drones play a part in finding a solution,” said Joel Segal, chair of the Africa Business Group at PwC. The drones are launched of a catapult from a base near the capital, Kigali, and they fly below 152 metres to avoid any other airspace traffic. According to Zipline they have an operational flying range of 93 miles. The drones are powered by a nose-mounted battery and guide themselves using GPS location data, and can relay information via a cellular link. The challenges Commercial drone delivery has the potential to revolutionise the delivery trade. However, there are a few problems that must be overcome. First, and this is true in most parts of the world, is legislation. In the US earlier this year new rules surrounding drone-use were established by the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority (FAA). A UK drone bill is also being discussed. In Africa there is an absence of progressive drone laws, and their use is restricted and prohibited. Rwanda, South Africa and Mauritius, however, are leading a change in perception with regulations that allow for drone licensing and operation. The second challenge, perhaps more problematic in a continent like Africa, is that these delivery drones could be mistaken for weaponised drones. “Whether we like it or not, UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] are confused with weaponised drones and are perceived by the general public as related to military operations and/or intelligence gathering,” one Congo-based worker told a study carried out by a Swiss foundation. “In countries and contexts with conflict environment, it is illusory to imagine that the general public, authorities and the armed actors will make a distinction between good ‘humanitarian/civilian’ drones and bad ‘military’ drones.” Admittedly, this is a hard challenge to overcome, but the potential environment, time and cost saving benefits of commercial drone use are worth the effort. Drones, suggests Segal, can ultimately be used to “offer opportunities for both businesses and government to accumulate and share data, combining resources to better estimate where populations are concentrated, areas where deprivation is most severe and consequently where to target investment and services.” Related Topics Africa Commercial drone delivery Conflict drones innovation Legislation Rwanda Comments (0) Leave a Reply Cancel replyLogin to comment Prev Next Read More Latest Popular How mobility leaders are driving modern businesses How Industry 4.0 is changing human-technology interaction The secret cyber-life of 10 year olds UK public sector increase in cloud use Future tech trends: these technologies will transform businesses The path to manageable data Wine cellar, swimming pool and a treehouse: Inside Zoopla’s new office The smart nation: Singapore’s masterplan Turning big data into high-class insights Rolling into the digital age: inside Rolls-Royce’s tech transformation Products Information Age Magazine Since its launch in 1995, Information Age has been regarded as one of the most respected technology titles in the B2B realm.

Google Maps for Android Gets Shortcut to View Traffic Data The app has just been updated with new features Oct 17, 2016 11:03 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google is constantly working on improving user experience in the Maps application, and it seems that a new feature has arrived to the app’s Android version. The update is available in the Google Play Store and should arrive to all users in a few days. The new feature allows users to view real-time traffic information and is part of the 9.39 version of Google Maps for Android. Before this update was released, users had to enter a destination or use the Driving Mode in order to get traffic information for their current location. The new update brings the Traffic Nearby shortcut, which opens with relevant information so that users wouldn’t need to use a certain mode in order to get data on traffic conditions. The information would make it easier for users to access data instantly before setting out. The feature also shows potential traffic jams and crowded roads. In addition, users can add a shortcut to the Traffic Nearby feature on their home screen, so they wouldn’t lose time by launching the app and searching for the shortcut inside. The shortcut widget is 1x1 in size and can be placed anywhere on the Android device’s screen, according to The Next Web. Recently, Google added a new Upcoming Events tab to Maps application, which displays a list of upcoming events, bookings and reservations. The company also provided restaurants with listings inside Maps, with the option to add multiple pictures of the dishes they serve.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Google#Google Maps#Android#Play Store#Traffic Nearby reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Traffic Nearby feature in Google Maps (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Korean Antitrust Agency to Examine Google’s Android Agreements Google Maps Now Shows Speed Limits During Navigation Lyft and Gett Get Google Maps Integration Google Risks $7.4 Billion Fine for Violating Antitrust Regulations in the EU 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon 2 photos    Traffic Nearby feature on Google Maps New Android APKs PokéMesh APK: Updated November 14th, 06:20 GMT Taskbar APK: Updated November 14th, 06:16 GMT Google Sheets APK: Updated November 14th, 06:13 GMT Maps APK: Updated November 14th, 05:23 GMT Facebook Lite APK: Updated November 14th, 05:19 GMT ShutApp APK: Updated November 14th, 05:16 GMT Navbar Apps APK: Updated November 13th, 17:48 GMT Reader comments Samsung Already Capable of Mass Producing Foldable Smartphones but It's Cautious more on: Samsung foldable phone i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Forget Decades: Why True Corporate Diversity is Attainable in Five Years or Less by Jen Boynton on Monday, Oct 17th, 2016 Society Share Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Sometimes it takes a moonshot goal to make real change — like three to five years to make Silicon Valley corporations as diverse as the communities in which they operate. It’s doable, says Emmett Carson, CEO of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. “All of the new jobs are not just software jobs. They’re not just tech/science jobs. If you work at one of these companies, there are HR position jobs, there are advertising jobs, there are legal jobs from mergers and acquisitions. There are marketing and communications jobs. And those are jobs where there are deep resources of talent in communities of color.” The man at the center of the Silicon Valley corporate philanthropy world may just be on to something with his mix of big goals, lobbying efforts, local community initiatives, and whispers into the ears of wealthy and influential corporate execs. Carson continues: “There is no reason why a concerted effort couldn’t make substantial change over three to five years … And it can be done without causing undue turmoil.” He believes there are plenty of quick wins to be had, and it doesn’t even require solving the pipeline problem. All it takes is real commitment from the C-suite. Silicon Valley Community Foundation is no podunk foundation. It counts some of the valley’s biggest companies as donors, including eBay, HP Enterprise, Symantec, LinkedIn, Microsoft and SAP. Last year, it gave $821 million in gifts. Carson proposes that instead of looking to innovate, companies look to the past.  If a company makes a big public commitment and stands by it, we can solve the diversity problem in tech.  Take Ford: “There was a time at which Ford Motor Co. wasn’t very diverse,” Carson says. “They made a concerted decision that they needed to be different.” And it worked. Indeed, in the 1920s, Ford was the largest employer of African Americans of any automotive company. The first collective bargaining agreement in 1941 explicitly prohibited discrimination based on “race, color, national origin or creed,” and Ford hired its first African American senior manager in 1950. “[Ford] did it in a structured way. They said: ‘It’s good for our business. We ought to be reflective of America.’ And they made it happen.” In fact, taking the approach of prioritizing change isn’t just a feel-good thing. It’s a matter of responding to customer demand and heeding the call of competitive advantage. There is a true market argument in favor of diversity. Just look at Google’s automatic image recognition software that worked perfectly until it was found to be misidentifying black people as gorillas. Get that straight. They launched a product to the public with that egregious error. Google’s mea culpa called it an unintentional algorithm glitch. While the mistake was not intentional, had people of color been on the coding team — or even in the room — it never would have happened. Hidden bias led coders to forget that skin color and facial features vary among the human population. Accident or no, it was inexcusable, And it cost Google money, hours of PR and rush jobs on the coding side to fix the problem. Without diversity, “you’re losing money in the marketplace,” Carson says. In addition to engaging decision-makers, SVCF invests in many concrete efforts to address inequality at the state level. Those run the gambit, from funding My Brother’s Keeper Alliance initiatives in San Jose and East Palo Alto, two lower-income cities in Silicon Valley; to lobbying to keep payday lenders (who prey on low-income individuals) from expanding; to spearheading SB359, legislation to allow 8th grade students of color who pass math tests to continue on to high school. That last one’s a head-scratcher. Why would we need this law? Well, sometimes you do. Carson explains: “We had uncovered that systematically across the state, black and Latino children who passed their 8th grade math tests were being required to repeat the test in 9th grade.” It was a problem. “One, it completely demoralized the kid who had performed. Second, it meant that the kid was now off track and unlikely to complete the math requirements so that they could enter a California state university … In addition, it meant that their lifetime earnings and the earnings of their family would be forever diminished.” The policy tackled a loophole in the system that allowed teachers to subjectively hold students back. A legislative fix like this won’t make a quantitative difference for some time. But it can make obtaining a high school diploma and going on to college just a little bit easier for a population that already faces a head wind. Permanent RVs line the street outside SVCF’s headquarters in Mountain View, a Silicon Valley city that was considered affordable 10 years ago. “It’s simply heartbreaking to see children coming home from school, carrying books, and going into an RV,” Carson explains. SVCF has even gone extremely local to help support the owners of RVs that have made the street behind the SVCF office their permanent home. “It’s just heartbreaking, and we’re working with the city to both provide housing and social services.  It’s disappointing for me to say this, but it’s necessary: [We’ve facilitated] … portable showers … I don’t say that with any pride, ‘Oh, wow, pat us on the back. We’re helping to get portable showers.’ That’s a stopgap for something that shouldn’t be acceptable in one of the wealthiest counties in the United States and in the world.” But the showers and social services SVCF arranged to provide do make a real, measurable improvement in the lives of people living permanently in what should be temporary homes. Addressing Silicon Valley’s housing crisis has become a key priority for SVCF. “The community foundation’s principle is that every community should have a home for every job in that community. Whatever job is generated that’s needed in that community, there ought to be an affordable home for the salary.” It doesn’t seem like too much to ask, but as we learned in our series last year on social inequality in Silicon Valley, housing is a huge issue for the entire region. Carson advocates for building up not out, to increase density and therefore supply on the peninsula, and a state or regional mandate to overcome the not-in-my-backyard issues that currently keep cities from zoning for new housing. When Carson talks about housing, he makes it clear that it’s not homeless or low-income housing he’s fighting for, although those are important too. “We have $100,000 software engineers who have to have roommates — not by choice, but because of the housing market. That is not sustainable, and if we don’t address that, it will corrode our entire community’s success.” The complicated issues of economic and racial inequality are difficult to unravel; and solutions must come from every angle too: corporate leaders, policy updates, and even modest efforts like our own Black Lives Matter and Beyond series. Each little effort to address economic inequality and educate ourselves about implicit biases and our own individual efforts to address them can bring about massive change — as long as we work together.

The DNCE frontman recently opened up during a Reddit chat with fans about the time he lost his virginity to the actress, telling fans: "You can probably just Google it. It's pretty easy to figure out. I dated a girl named Ashley, so just Google it to figure out which Ashley that is." Following Joe's admission, the Twilight star appeared to throw shade on Instagram when she posted: "Class is timeless." Now the 27-year-old singer has insisted he didn't intend to cause offence with his tale, telling Entertainment Tonight: "I'm not out to hurt anybody, but I think, ultimately, I'm just telling my stories and what I can say from my heart." Joe also told the outlet that he always wants to be true to himself, labelling himself an "honest guy". "I think life's too short, you know?" he added. "I mean ultimately, I think of myself as an honest guy. There are just those moments in life where you have to be true to yourself and true to the world." Joe's sex tale saw him admit to fans that he raided his bandmate's room for condoms for the encounter with Ashley, who he dated when he was 20. "I didn't have any condoms, so I went to our drummer, Jack's, room... and I demolished his room looking for them," he said in the AMA. "Found them underneath his underwear drawer. When he came home, he thought somebody broke into his room because his whole room was demolished because I was in dire need. Needed to happen then and now. Safety first, kids." Joe is enjoying huge success with his band DNCE, who recently released their sexy Body Moves video. Joe gets up close and personal with actress and model Charlotte MCKinney for the video, and told Billboard he was thrilled to be given the opportunity to kiss such a beauty. Asked how his teenage self would have reacted to the video, Joe replied: "He’d say, 'Lucky you.' I think more so he’d be like, 'Damn, could we speed up this process so I can be in that video.' Took too damn long."

According to tech tip king Evan Blass, Google is slated to release its own smartwatches in the first quarter of 2017. The company is expected to launch two watches with Android Wear 2.0 in tow. We heard rumors about Google working on its own wearables back in July, the larger of which packs a heart rate monitor and offers well GPS and LTE capabilities. The image in Blass’ tweet is from Android Police’s recreations of prototypes, based on information from the publication’s anonymous source.

Join a chat The arrival of new watches next year makes a lot of sense when you consider the strong push into hardware that Google recently made: The tech giant unveiled a slew of new gadgets earlier this month, including two Pixel smartphones, a voice-activated speaker, a VR viewer, a Wi-Fi router and a 4K Chromecast. In addition, Google noted last month that Android Wear 2.0’s public release was being pushed to next year to allow time for further refinement. The new version of the OS, which was first announced at Google’s IO conference, will bring numerous features like handwriting support and a full QWERTY keyboard, the ability for watchfaces to display info from other apps and one-touch smart replies based on the context of your incoming messages, as well as a Play Store exclusively for Android Wear. We’ve contacted Google to learn more and will update this post if there’s a response.

Tags : Android-Android+ Apps-Apps+ Google-Google+ Google has just pushed a new update for the Google Maps for Android app that allows users to quickly view real-time traffic information. Version 9.39 of Google Maps for Android introduces a useful shortcut for viewing traffic information. Previously, users had to enter a destination or engage the ‘Driving Mode’ to view traffic information for their location. With the new update, the app now shows a ‘Traffic Nearby’ shortcut, which quickly directs users to the relevant screen. This new feature makes a lot of sense for those who just want to poll the traffic information without setting a destination first. If you’re planning to go out for lunch, you may want to be aware of any potential traffic jams before picking a spot, which is exactly where the new feature comes in. Users can also add a shortcut to the ‘Traffic Nearby’ feature on their home screen. To do this, you should open the widget library on your Android device and then place the corresponding 1x1 shortcut in any of your home screens. At the moment, the new shortcut is only available for Android devices. Note that the update is rolling out in batches, so not everyone will see it available in the Play Store. This new feature is just the latest in a series of updates designed to make Google Maps more useful for drivers. A few weeks ago, Google’s navigation app was updated with a range of advanced voice commands. Furthermore, through a previous update, users were also granted the ability to enter multiple stops for a single trip (a feature that was previously limited to the desktop version of Google Maps. source: Google Play via The Next Web Share Tweet Share Google Pixel ad parody pays homage to the Motorola Nexus 6 17 Oct Prev news Deal: get a Samsung Wireless Charging Pad at nearly 50% off the usual price 17 Oct Next news Close newer posts 5 cool RPG and adventure games with dungeons on Android and iOS 17 Oct LG G5 to receive Android 7.0 Nougat update in November 17 Oct Nokia confirms presence at MWC 2017, but smartphone announcements are not 17 Oct Deal: get a Samsung Wireless Charging Pad at nearly 50% off the usual price 17 Oct Now reading: Google Maps update introduces a handy shortcut to the 'Traffic Nearby' screen Google Maps update introduces a handy shortcut to the 'Traffic Nearby' 17 Oct Google Pixel ad parody pays homage to the Motorola Nexus 6 17 Oct Best new Android and iPhone games (October 11th - October 17th) 17 Oct Sony's Xperia X, X Performance, and Xperia XA are currently on sale at 17 Oct SwiftKey Beta gets Incognito Mode in the newest update 17 Oct Facebook is testing a 'Data Saver' feature in its Messenger app for Android 17 Oct older posts Featured stories   Apple with three new iPads in March, including a bezel-less 10.9-inch model   Black on AMOLED screens saves power, but how much?   HTC Bolt: 10 key features   The HTC Bolt is official!   iPhone a top-seller in the US, declines in China; Samsung losing its grip on Europe   How to shoot RAW photos with your iPhone 0 Comments Follow Following view all comments Want to comment?

Comment Comment Rohan Silva: Tech City’s go-getting example can help post-Brexit Britain Rohan Silva Monday 17 October 2016 09:17 BST Rohan Silva: 'It’s not easy to win new investment but if you work hard enough, anything is possible' Nigel Howard / Evening Standard I feel old. Exactly six years ago this month, I was on a trade mission to Silicon Valley, trying to convince US tech giants to invest in east London. I’d organised the trip ahead of the launch of the Tech City initiative, which I’d hoped would turbocharge the growth of the small digital cluster around Old Street. The stakes were high: we needed to secure global investment or the project would be dead on arrival. The entrepreneurial minister Jeremy Hunt and the former head of the Olympic Park legacy corporation, Andy Altman, also made the journey, and our days were packed with visits to sceptical tech bigwigs who had zero interest in the UK, and no idea there were so many brilliant companies being started in the capital. It was a tough slog, and things were looking grim when we arrived at Google’s sprawling HQ. It was our last meeting before heading home, and we were seeing Eric Schmidt, the company’s powerful CEO, so we had to make it count.  As soon as we walked in, we began selling Tech City hard, fighting to persuade Eric that Google should invest there. He didn’t know anything about the area, so instinctively rejected the idea, saying: “We don’t put our people in a business park in the middle of nowhere.” Eric was clearly sick of government delegations pitching projects in remote parts of far-flung countries.  Fortunately that wasn’t the case with us. We described east London’s art galleries, bars and music venues, and Eric started to be won over. He looked at Andy Altman and said: “You’re in charge of the Olympic Park. How much would it cost us to buy the entire thing?” The poor Google staffers looked nervous — was their boss being serious? Luckily for them, Andy had no way to answer the question, so the conversation moved on, and we’ll never know for sure.  Read more Rohan Silva: How to make it easier to be an entrepreneur and a parent In the end, we shook hands on a commitment that Google would create an “innovation centre” in Tech City, which David Cameron announced just a few weeks later. This is how the Google Campus in Bonhill Street came into being: a five-storey building that hosts start-up events every day and provides cheap workspace, mentoring and funding for small businesses.  This investment was hugely important for Tech City and the London economy. For a start, it created a generous community space for techies to come together, sparking valuable new collaborations and businesses, and catalysing the development of our city’s digital ecosystem. Policy-makers often overlook the importance of physical hubs where innovation happens, and it’s vital that the Government’s new industrial strategy doesn’t make that mistake. What’s more, other global companies soon followed suit, and Amazon, Microsoft, Intel, Cisco and many others committed to investing millions in east London, helping make Tech City the fastest-growing digital cluster in the world.  These memories came flooding back to me this weekend when Theresa May announced new trade missions to boost international links after the Brexit vote. As our Silicon Valley trip showed, it’s not easy to win new investment but if you work hard enough, anything is possible. And once the floodgates open, a trickle can quickly become a tsunami. If Britain is going to flourish outside the EU, that’s exactly what we’re going to need.

On one side is Samsung, the stalwart crown-wearer of the last couple of years. On the other side is… Google? Where the Nexus devices were really phones designed and built by Google's hardware partners, the Pixel is far more of an in-house Google device. It might be put together in HTC's factories, but it's got Google's stamp all over it. Which might make it seem a little odd that it looks remarkably like an iPhone. Still, this is a very intriguing high-end Android flagship option, but there's a Samsung-shaped barrier in its way to success. Until the incredible bargain of the OnePlus 3, the Galaxy S7 ruled our best smartphones ranking, replacing the Galaxy S6 after about a year of its own reign. If you want the absolute best of the best, regardless of value, it's the Galaxy S7. Does the Google Pixel really give Samsung's shining star a run for its money? Here's our analysis, now that we've put the Pixel through an exhaustive review. Design: Samsung vs... Apple? There's no denying it: the Pixel looks a lot like an iPhone from the front, sans the home button of course, and even from the bottom of the back. It flips the script up top on the back, however, switching the matte backing to a glossy surface and the fingerprint sensor. That two-tone experiment is a nice tweak, although overall, the Pixel's look is a bit uninspired, despite being a blend of metal and polished glass. It just doesn't feel as premium as it needs to as this price.  Contrast that to the Galaxy S7, which is a lot more alluring and feels like a luxury device. It's not a dramatic departure from the Galaxy S6, but the more rounded curves are nice, as is the curved glass backing. Also, Samsung's phone is waterproof, while the Pixel is not. All told, score multiple points for Samsung here. Winner: Samsung Galaxy S7 Also Read Google Pixel review Screen: Quad or Full HD? Samsung tends to win most smartphone screen battles these days due to the incredible clarity and colors of its AMOLED displays, but this one's especially easy: the Galaxy S7's 5.1in Quad HD display weighs in at a staggering 2560x1440 resolution, while the Pixel's 5in AMOLED screen is just a 1080p panel (1920x1080). For a five-inch phone, a 1080p display looks just fine – but Samsung's screen is noticeably crisper, and the superior brightness and viewing angles of Super AMOLED give it an even stronger nod here. Honestly, it's surprising to see a £600 Android phone without a Quad HD panel at this point, so the Pixel has an uphill battle against other flagships as well. Winner: Samsung Galaxy S7 Camera: Two shooters enter... Until recently, the Galaxy S7 was our clear favourite for a smartphone camera. And you, dear readers, agreed with us: in a blind preference test, you gave the Galaxy S7 a slight edge over the OnePlus 3. Samsung's 12-megapixel rear shooter, with its optical image stabilisation and f/1.7 aperture, is rather brilliant overall. The impressive iPhone 7 Plus camera complicates matters a bit, and could give the Galaxy S7 a run for its money once we conduct a proper head-to-head test… but what about the Google Pixel? Well, DxOMark fired the first shot, and the imaging site gave the Pixel its highest smartphone camera rating ever: an 89. Granted, that's only one point higher than the Galaxy S7, which netted an 88 and was previously tied for the lead. The Pixel also has a 12-megapixel back camera, but there's no optical image stabilisation and the f/2.0 aperture won't let in as much light. In day-to-day usage, however, they both deliver remarkably strong photos. The Pixel has especially fantastic outside exposure, for example, and the electronic stabilisation for video is an awesome perk. Is it better than the Galaxy S7's camera, though? It's too close to call, honestly, and members of our staff have their own preferences. We'll say this: if you buy either the Galaxy S7 or Pixel, you'll have one of the two best Android phone cameras today - and you can't go wrong either way. Winner: Draw Also Read 5 of the best Samsung Galaxy Note 7 alternatives Power: About the same As very expensive flagship phones, it's little surprise that both devices have some high-end components inside. On the Galaxy S7, you'll get Samsung's own blazing-fast Exynos 8890 processor in the UK, along with 4GB RAM. In the States, it's Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 chip with 4GB RAM. Either way, the performance is about the same in our experience. Meanwhile, the Pixel uses the slightly enhanced Snapdragon 821 processor with 4GB RAM, but the difference isn't really noticeable in everyday use. Both phones run apps, games, and media without breaking a sweat, and multitask with the greatest of ease, and they're both among the most powerful devices you can grab today. It's even again here, in our estimation. Winner: Draw Perks: Galactic benefits Both devices have mobile VR solutions: Daydream VR for the Pixel and Gear VR for the Galaxy S7. While Daydream might ultimately be the bigger VR platform in good time, the Gear VR has a couple-year head start with a solid array of early content to check out, plus the Quad HD screen is a big benefit when you're slapping a display in front of your eyes. When it comes to storage, the Pixel's iPhone-like design has an iPhone-like weakness: no external storage. Samsung's phone, on the other hand, lets you pop in a microSD card to expand upon the base storage of 32GB or 64GB. With the Pixel, you're stuck with the 32GB or 128GB you begin with. Even the battery on the Galaxy S7 is bulkier, at 3,000mAh vs 2,770mAh on the Pixel, although the higher-res screen of the Galaxy probably eats up that extra capacity over the course of the day. Both are strong all-day devices, however, with moderate use. And the Galaxy S7 also gives you wireless charging as standard, while the Pixel does not. Seeing a trend? In some ways, the Pixel feels like a premium-priced phone without the kind of premium perks that Samsung has made standard for top-end flagships. All told, Samsung notches a big win in this broad category of bonus features. Winner: Samsung Galaxy S7 Also Read Google Daydream View hands-on review Verdict: Still Samsung Consider us unconvinced by the Google Pixel's value proposition, especially when matched up against the Galaxy S7. Both are £500-£600 devices, but the money-for-hardware equation seems a little off-balance for the standard Pixel model. You get a lot more with the Samsung Galaxy S7, whether it's screen resolution, premium design and build, wireless charging, microSD support, or waterproofing. Some elements are pretty even between the two devices, including overall camera quality and processing muscle, but those added perks really put the Galaxy S7 over the top in this particular showdown. The Galaxy S7 is so great because it has all of those extra benefits, which help justify the price point for anyone willing to spend that much on a smartphone. A more apt comparison to the Pixel when it comes to features is the OnePlus 3, but given that phone's £329 price point compared to the £599 for the Pixel, it hardly seems like a fair fight. Google's first in-house phone is interesting in many ways, but £600 worth of interesting? Not when you consider the competition. In this case, that kind of money is better spent with Samsung and the sterling Galaxy S7. Overall winner: Samsung Galaxy S7 Buy the Samsung Galaxy S7 from Mobile Phones Direct Buy the Google Pixel from PC World Liked that? Read this...

(Motorola) RELATED ARTICLES Motorola a hit on SA's Orange online store Motorola Moto Maker on the cards for SA? Motorola smartphones are coming back to SA Johannesburg - Chinese computing giant Lenovo is readying to launch its ‘Moto’ smartphones in South Africa on Thursday, a move that heralds the return of Motorola in South Africa. Lenovo bought Motorola Mobility from Google in late 2014 for $2.91bn. Google previously paid $12.5bn for Motorola Mobility in 2011. Amid Motorola Mobility’s changes in ownership, the brand’s last high profile smartphone launch in South Africa was the release of its Razr Maxx handset in 2012. In January last year, the President of Lenovo Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Aymar de Lencquesaing told Fin24 that Motorola phones would make a comeback in SA before the end of 2015. Lenovo, though, didn’t manage to launch Motorola back into the SA market last year as previously planned. In January 2016, Lenovo also re-branded Motorola as ‘Moto’. But Fin24 understands that Lenovo will launch Moto phones into the South African market on Thursday at a launch event in Johannesburg, with one of the phones being its Android powered Moto Z. Local Lenovo officials couldn’t be immediately reached for comment on Monday. Lenovo’s current PR firm, Hill+Knowlton Strategies, told Fin24 that “Lenovo will make comment at and after the launch”. An invite to journalists to attend a Lenovo launch on Thursday, though, hints at a "Lenovo Moto Launch". An invite to journalists that outlines Lenovo's planned launch on Thursday, October 20. The re-launch of the Moto phones in South Africa has become an open secret in South Africa. On Friday, Lenovo’s Africa Twitter account further hinted at the Moto South Africa launch in a tweet. We are not saying anything… except that we're excited! #hellomoto #SA pic.twitter.com/SG1p1y4bjW— Lenovo Africa (@Lenovo_Africa) October 14, 2016 In June this year, local Lenovo executives were quoted in the press as saying that plans were in place to bring the Moto brand to South Africa before the end of 2016.

But she insisted that she was not limiting its scope. (See 4.49pm.) Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has dismissed suggestions that she mislead a Commons home affairs committee about the events that led to the resignation of Dame Lowell Goddard, the previous inquiry chair. Goddard resigned in August after serious concerns were raised about her conduct, including an allegation that she had used racist language. But when Rudd gave evidence to the committee in September, she just said that Goddard stood down because she was lonely. In the Commons Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said this meant Rudd was open to “accusations of misleading the committee”. But Rudd said that Goddard strongly denied the allegations and that it would have been wrong for Rudd to have raised them with MPs. She said: I was asked [at the select committee] why Dame Lowell had gone. Dame Lowell had not spoken to me about her reasons, so I relied on the letter she had sent to the committee. In her letter she said she was lonely and felt that she could not deliver and that was why she stepped down. Dame Lowell has strongly refuted the allegations about her, and the only way we could understand properly why she resigned would be to hear from Dame Lowell herself. To echo any further allegations that are now likely to be the subject of legal dispute would have been entirely inappropriate. In response the Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who tabled the urgent question that led to Rudd addressing MPs, said Rudd’s explanation was unsatisfactory. Nandy said: This inquiry was established to shine a spotlight on institutions characterized by a culture of secrecy, denial and cover-up in which child abusers were able to operate in plain sight without challenge or consequence. It is a tragedy that the inquiry itself has become dogged by complaints about the very problems it was designed to expose and that for survivors of abuse will be far too familiar. If it is to proceed with confidence the home secretary and the prime minister need to answer the very many questions over this inquiry starting with the truth surrounding the departure of Dame Lowell Goddard. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, has warned that the safety of up to 400 unaccompanied children stranded in the Calais refugee camp is being put at risk by the government’s “foot-dragging”. A Conservative councillor has been suspended by his local party after starting a petition to make opposing Brexit into an act of treason. As the Press Association reports, Guildford councillor Christian Holliday’s petition for a change in the law to make supporting UK membership of the European Union a crime attracted more than 1,250 signatures within four days of being launched on the parliamentary website. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.49am EDT 11:49 Jay announces new approach to child abuse inquiry to make it manageable Here is more from Professor Alexis Jay’s BBC interview about her review of how the child abuse inquiry operates. She has also put a summary statement on the inquiry’s website, and a full statement here (pdf). Although she said she would not be reducing the scope of the inquiry, she has unveiled a new strategy designed to make it manageable. She said she hoped the inquiry would complete a “significant amount” of its work by the end of 2020. The inquiry has been running 13 investigative strands, looking at child abuse within various institutions. In future it is going to focus more on four thematic strands. They are: Cultural - examining attitudes, behaviours and values within institutions. Structural - looking at the legislative, governance and organisational frameworks within and between institutions. Financial - considering the financial, funding and resource arrangements for institutions and services. Professional and political - focusing on leadership, professional and practice issues for those working or volunteering in relevant institutions. Jay said a traditional public inquiry approach to the allegations would fail. I believe that the concerns that our terms of reference cannot be delivered are founded on an assumption that we must seek to replicate a traditional public inquiry in respect of each of the thousands of institutions that fall within our remit. We will do so for some, but we would never finish if we did it for all. Jay ordered a review of how the inquiry operates when she took over as chair in August. She said today her review was not yet complete, and that it would be finished by the end of November. Today is about outlining the strategy I intend to pursue to make the inquiry manageable and deliverable in a specified timescale. If we were to pursue the traditional public hearing model that people associate with inquiries of this kind to the thousands and thousands of institutions in England and Wales, we would fail, so there’s no possibility that we can do that. She said the four themes were “absolutely central to looking at institutions and their failings in the past, if any exist” and that the inquiry would be holding public hearings related to the four themes. For example, we might ask certain council leaders or police and crime commissioners to account publicly for what they’ve done in relation to the subject of child sexual abuse within their areas of responsibility. Asked if her announcement was reducing the scope and scale of the inquiry, she replied: It’s certainly not reducing the terms of reference in the inquiry. We have no intention to propose that any aspect of the terms of reference is dropped. But we do intend to use different models and ways of working to deliver the terms of reference. In that respect we consider that we can complete a significant amount of the inquiry’s work by the end of 2020. She said no decisions have been made about the 13 investigations. Asked if some of them could be cut, she said: It really is impossible for me to say just now because it is quite a complex matter and we need to take the views of core participants and other relevant parties into account.

Asked about the involvement of UK troops in the push on Mosul, Theresa May’s official spokeswoman said: With regard to the work that is ongoing with Iraqi forces, we are taking part in the coalition to counter Daesh and support the work of the Iraqi forces. We have been involved in the training of the Iraqi forces to help prepare for the fight against Isis and support the efforts of the Iraqi government to take their country back from terrorists. We have UK personnel in Iraq involved in the training of Iraqi forces. Downing Street also said the decision to shut down Russia Today’s UK bank accounts was “a matter for the bank to decide based on their own risk appetite”, and confirmed it was taken independently without consultation with the government. Asked if the action was welcome as a move to restrict propaganda, the spokeswoman said: “The issue as I understand it relates to action taken by the bank, which is a matter for them. More broadly, we clearly want to make sure misinformation is not being spread.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.12am EDT 11:12 That’s it.

The search giant has been producing its own Android-based phones for the last few years under the "Nexus" brand - but no more. Google has ditched the name Nexus in favour of the Pixel moniker. In the past, the company has used the Pixel name on its premium tablet and laptop products.

Alternatively, you can go to the network EE, which has an exclusive right to the Pixel phone in the UK. With EE, the Pixel is free on a £50.99 a month, 24 month 4GEE plan, which comes with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 10GB of mobile data a month for existing customers.

Alternatively, for just £5 per month more, you can get Pixel and Pixel XL on 4GEE Max plans giving you access to the UK’s fastest 4G speeds, and inclusive access to the BT Sport App for the duration of the plan.

There will be a choice of either 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, and Google is also offering Pixel owners free unlimited storage for photos and videos through its Google Photos app. And - of course - Google has kept the 3.5mm headphone jack in place, unlike Apple which ditched it with the launch of the iPhone 7. Read More What makes phone batteries explode? And what to do if YOU bought Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 Both the Pixel and the XL have a similar design to last year's well-received Nexus 6P albeit with a thinner bezel that means a near edge-to-edge display. Price Buying directly from Google or Carphone Warehouse means you can pick up the phones SIM-free and unlocked for the one-off price of £599 for the 5-inch Pixel and £719 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. That puts them in exactly the same kind of territory as Apple’s iPhone models. It looks like EE is the only network in the UK that will stock the phone on contract, and we'll update this as soon as we know for certain. Read More iPhone 7 vs Galaxy S7: Which smartphone is best when Apple and Samsung go toe-to-toe? Specifications The Pixel XL has 5.5-inch 2,560 x 1,440 AMOLED display with a quad-core Qualcomm processor, 4GB of RAM, USB Type-C port, and rear-facing fingerprint reade. It has a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 8-megapixel front-facing one. It will also have a beefy 3,450mAh battery and standard 32GB of storage, with the option to upgrade to a 128GB if needed. Read More Android 7.0 Nougat: All the features of Google's new mobile operating system and how to download it onto your smartphone The regular Pixel has similar specs, but it’s clearly the lower-end of the two flagships. It will sport a 5-inch Full HD AMOLED display, quad-core 2.0GHz 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, the same cameras as the XL and a smaller 2,770mAh battery. As expected, it will also come with a rear-mounted fingerprint reader and a USB Type-C port. Features Both Pixel phones come pre-installed with the latest version of Android (Nougat), as well as Google's AI-powered assistant Allo and the FaceTime-style app Duo. Google also "live cases" that can be customised with your favorite photos and places, as well as exclusive designs from artists like Justin Maller, and photographers like Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield. Should you buy it? If you don't like the idea of an iPhone 7 there's a lot to suggest Google's phones will offer a decent alternative. These phones will be developed to Google's spec so should have the best integration with Android on the market. What's more, they're going to be entirely free of the third-party bloatware commonly loaded onto Android phones by other manufacturers.

While both have their pros and cons and co-exist in today's technology world, the real pain is to transfer data from one platform to another. Most of us use data transfer apps like Share it, Xender, etc. to transfer media files, but what about the files stored in iCloud Drive? How to make sure you don't lose the data stored on Apple cloud and successfully transfer it to Google's cloud platform- Google Drive. SEE ALSO: Apple iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel XL: Do they bring along the Innovation We Need If you are struggling with the transition process, you are at the right place. Here are 5 simple steps to help you transfer your iCloud files to Google Drive by using iCloud and Google Drive desktop apps. 1) The first step is to download and install iCloud and Google Drive desktop clients on your Windows PC. When you download and set up iCloud on your Windows PC, your photos, videos, mail, files, and bookmarks stored in iCloud drive become accessible on your Windows PC. 2) Post installing the storage clients, sign in with your respective iCloud id and Google Drive id to access your stored files.

That's it, you are done. Now Google Drive will sync all the files.

He said “a variety of factors have been holding down interest rates and may continue to do so for some time,” which seems contrary to the idea of an imminent US rate rise. So the pound is currently up 0.07% at $1.2192, while against the euro it is off its worst levels, down 0.19% at €1.1084. As for bonds, they have also recovered some ground but the 10 year yield at 1.117%, up 0.02 percentage points, is still at its highest since the aftermath of the Brexit vote. On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.35pm EDT 12:35 Factors holding down interest rates could continue - Fed's Fischer A leading member of the US Federal Reserve has warned of the dangers of continuing low interest rates. Vice chairman Stanley Fischer said in a speech in New York there were three reasons to be concerned about low rates: First, and most worrying, is the possibility that low long-term interest rates are a signal that the economy’s long-run growth prospects are dim...A second concern is that low interest rates make the economy more vulnerable to adverse shocks that can put it in a recession...And the third concern is that low interest rates may also threaten financial stability as some investors reach for yield and compressed net interest margins make it harder for some financial institutions to build up capital buffers... Those are three powerful reasons to prefer interest rates that are higher than current rates. But, of course, Fed interest rates are kept very low at the moment because of the need to maintain aggregate demand at levels that will support the attainment of our dual policy goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, defined as the rate of inflation in the price level of personal consumption expenditures.. being at our target level of 2 percent. He said there were a variety of factors holding down interest rates - including slow economic growth, low investment, a slowdown in the global economy - and they may continue to go so for some time. But he added economic policy could help offset these factors, and boost the economy’s growth potential: While there is disagreement about what the most effective policies would be, some combination of more encouragement for private investment, improved public infrastructure, better education, and more effective regulation is likely to promote faster growth of productivity and living standards--and also to reduce the probability that the economy and, particularly, the central bank will in the future have to contend with the effective lower bound.

Helena Smith reports from Athens: Timed to coincide with the arrival this week of international inspectors, the rally is one of scores taking place this evening around Greece by protestors aligned with the communist-run labour group Pame. In a sign of the disquiet measures have caused, some 436 labour groups have joined the protests seen as the first step in a campaign to send a “fierce response” to a government implementing “barbaric measures” under the guise of progressive policy.

Meanwhile technical groups representing the EU and IMF have been poring over files in preparation of the arrival of mission chiefs. The review, projected by credit rating agency Fitch to take months, comes as government officials announced that prime minister Alexis Tsipras will meet the French and German leaders later this week to discuss the review.

Reports of divisions between Chancellor Philip Hammond and the rest of Theresa May’s cabinet over Brexit have caused investors to sell UK assets across the board. UK stocks, bonds and the pound were all lower on Monday. Over the weekend Mr Hammond was rumoured as preparing to quit over the divisions, though the Treasury has since denied this is the case. In a cabinet with some hot-headed opinions on Brexit, Mr Hammond is viewed by markets as a cooler cucumber. His departure and the resulting political uncertainty would likely see another nose-dive in the pound and exacerbate the rise in gilt yields. The EY Item Club calling the economic stability in the UK since the Brexit vote “deceptive” and Open Europe suggesting banks could shift operations to Europe in 2017 without passporting rights are doing little to remedy shaken sentiment. The government bond sell-off has sent UK 10 year Gilt yields to the highest since the EU referendum, putting them on course for one of the biggest monthly rises in 20 years. US markets have also edged lower although positive results from Bank of America have helped limit the damage. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 66 points or 0.94% at 6947.55 Germany’s Dax dropped 0.73% to 10,503.57 France’s Cac closed down 0.46% at 4450.23 Italy’s FTSE MIB added 0.23% to 16,630.34 Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.31% at 8740.7 In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.55% to 586.06 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 24 points or 0.13%.

In a sign of apparent cabinet tensions over the balance between limiting immigration and keeping open access to the EU, unnamed cabinet sources told two newspapers about anger towards Hammond over his concerns about plans to swiftly restrict immigration from the EU. But the prime minister’s official spokeswoman told reporters: “The prime minister has full confidence in the chancellor and the work that he is doing.” The chancellor is said to have used a meeting last week of May’s cabinet Brexit committee to urge caution about a plan to force EU workers to show they have a guaranteed skilled job before they are allowed into Britain.

Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Monday he was optimistic about a deal but when asked if his country’s output was now high enough after its return on sanctions for it to join an agreement, he said: “We should decide in November how much each country should produce.” The amount each country can produce could well prove a new stumbling block.

Core prices, which exclude energy and food prices, are also expected to pick up to 1.4% from 1.3%. We believe that the risks are to the upside for September’s price data, as the impact of a weak pound continues to weigh on price pressure.... We think.. annual CPI could breach the 1% mark for September, while the market expects a reading of 0.9%. A strong inflation reading could be another reason to sell the pound tomorrow, which, ironically, could lead to even higher inflation in the coming months. If prices rise as we expect, then the Monetary Policy Committee’s 2% inflation target to be breached at some point in the first quarter of 2017. If, against the odds, CPI does not rise by as much as expected, then we would expect the pound to rally as it could brighten the UK economic outlook and put less pressure on future consumption. However, we view this outcome as unlikely at this stage.

The new orders index edged up but remained negative at -5.6, indicating an ongoing drop in orders, and the shipments index increased to -0.6, suggesting that shipments were essentially flat. Labor market conditions remained weak, with both employment levels and the average workweek reported as lower. Price indexes increased somewhat, and continued to signal moderate input price increases and a slight increase in selling prices. But the outlook is more optimistic: Indexes for the six-month outlook suggested that manufacturing firms expect conditions to improve in the months ahead.

Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji Samsung has stopped the production and distribution of their Galaxy Note 7 smartphones following several incidents involving the handsets’ battery overheating and catching fire. If you are reading this article using a Samsung Note 7, please do yourself a favour: Turn off the phone and return the device at the nearest Samsung centre. You are going to need a new phone, of course, so here’s the list of the three best -- and safe -- Galaxy Note 7 alternatives out in the market to help you decide. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge It is only proper that the best alternative to the Galaxy Note 7 should also be a Samsung smartphone. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is the closest thing to the Galaxy Note 7 you can find, offering the same distinctive quality and robust capabilities. One notable difference is the absence of the contemporary S-Pen. The Galaxy S7 Edge also has a slightly smaller screen size at 5.5 inches compared to the Galaxy Note 7’s display of 5.7 inches. All the basic goodies are still there though. The Galaxy S7 Edge is basically a compact version of the Galaxy Note 7 that doesn’t explode. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is available via Vodafone. They have plans that start at $83 a month. Google Pixel XL Compared to the 5.7-inch screen of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, Google’s brand new Pixel XL has 5.5 inches of Quad HD display. The Google smartphone features the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and 4 GB RAM as the Galaxy Note 7. The smaller display size of the Pixel XL also provides better pixel density, so there is no room for complaints. The Google Pixel XL’s sleek, aluminium-and-glass premium design is also a nice incentive. The smartphone’s intelligent personal assistant, simply called Google Assistant, can be used to find easier traffic routes and book dinner reservations using voice commands. The Pixel XL is also compatible with Daydream, Google’s new virtual reality platform. The Google Pixel XL smartphone will be launched in Australia on Oct. 20, with Telstra as the exclusive carrier partner. They offer plans that start at $92 per month. Motorola Moto Z The Moto Z is an ultra-thin smartphone with a 5.5-inch Quad HD display capped by Gorilla Glass 4. This Motorola smartphone’s 13-megapixel primary camera is great for taking photos even in low light. Its secondary 5-megapixel selfie camera is also more than capable. The handset also comes with the same chipset as the Galaxy Note 7. Unfortunately, the Moto Z does not come with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, just like the Apple iPhone 7. The box comes with a headphone adapter, though, so you won’t have to pay extra to listen to your favourite tunes. The Moto Z is available for purchase at the Motorola store.

China to launch manned space mission today China is to launch its longest and most ambitious manned space mission later today, at 7:30 CST (23:30 BST), when two taikonauts will ascend to the Tiangong 2 space laboratory, where they will live and work for the next month (Reuters). The Shenzhou 11 mission is a stepping stone toward's China's goal of setting up a permanent manned space station by 2022. Taikonaut Chen Dong said that "we will focus on improving our ability to handle emergencies in orbit, medical first aid, mutual rescue capabilities and space experiments."

Germany forbids Tesla from referring to Autopilot in ads Germany's Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has written to Tesla to insist that the electric car maker ceases using the term 'Autopilot' in its advertising (MarketWatch). The ministry has made the demand in order to "prevent misunderstanding and incorrect customers’ expectations", although Tesla maintains that the driver assistance feature is comparable to the autopilot assistant features found in aircraft, where the term originated. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has tweeted that an announcement planned for today has been pushed back to Wednesday, October 19. 3. Juno spacecraft suffers engine problems Nasa has announced that the Juno spacecraft, currently in orbit around Jupiter, is experiencing engine problems (Ars Technica). Juno project manager Rick Nybakken explained that the problem affects a pair of helium check valves that are critical to firing the craft's main LEROS 1b engine: "The valves should have opened in a few seconds, but it took several minutes. We need to better understand this issue before moving forward with a burn of the main engine." The engine was scheduled to fire this coming Wednesday, when Juno's proximity to Jupiter is optimal for bringing to the spacecraft into a shorter orbital period, but the attempt is now set to be delayed until December 11. If the issue cannot be resolved, Juno will have to fly fewer orbits of the gas giant, although its ability to collect scientific data will not be affected. 4. Facebook is trialling a data saver mode for Messenger Facebook's Messenger mobile app is a notorious data hog, but the company has plans to fix that with a new Data Saver mode (TheNextWeb). Whenever you're connected via mobile broadband, Data Saver will kick in, preventing the app from automatically downloading potentially bandwidth-hungry images and videos – users can instead click to download only they content they wish to see.

The rocket's Cygnus cargo capsule will once again be carrying food, supplies and experiments to the ISS. The launch, originally scheduled for the weekend, has been delayed until 19:40 EDT on October 17 (October 18 at 00:40 in the UK) due to a "ground support equipment (GSE) cable that did not perform as expected during the pre-launch check out."

Samsung Galaxy Note 7 banned from all US flights The United States Department of Transport has banned all Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones from being taken aboard planes as either hold or carry-on luggage (TechCrunch). This made it illegal to take the phones onto US flights as of midday on October 15. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx said that "we are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung has recalled all Galaxy Note 7 devices 8. Rockstar teases new Red Dead Redemption release Rockstar Games' social media avatars and cover images have turned blood-red in what's widely thought to be a teaser for the long-awaited release of Red Dead Redemption 2 (IGN). The move follows a leak that appeared to show the game's map and a promise from publisher Take-Two that Rockstar has been "hard at work on some exciting future projects that will be revealed soon." The company has a history of subtle release teasers, with Grand Theft Auto V hinted at in a similar fashion in 2011, a week before the release of its first trailer. 9. PlayStation games could be coming to Android and iOS Japanese news agency Nikkei reports that Sony is returning to mobile gaming with plans to release five "or more" new mobile games, starting from March 2018 (WIRED). Similar to rival Nintendo's mobile plans - which so far comprise the already-launched Miitomo, upcoming Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem games, as well as Super Mario Run for iPhone - Sony plans to leverage its existing portfolio of titles, with games based on "popular PlayStation series". ForwardWorks, the new mobile-focused studio Sony established in March 2016, will "handle distribution" of the new games. Titles are expected to be announced later this year. 10. Studio Ghibli's first TV series is coming to Amazon Amazon has announced that it will be releasing the English-language dub of Studio Ghibli's first TV series, Ronja the Robber's Daughter (Ars Technica UK). First released in Japan in 2014, the children's series, based on a story by Astrid Lindgren, was directed by Goro Miyazaki and features a combination of traditional and 3D animation. The series doesn't yet have a release date, but Amazon has confirmed that it will include the voice talents of Gillian Anderson and will debut on Amazon Video in the UK, USA, Germany, Austria and Japan.

These self-lacing ‘Nike Mags’ based on the fictional pair from the second film worn by Michael J. Fox, have been recreated by the company, equipped with lights and the ability to auto-tighten using power laces. By placing your foot in the shoe, pressure on the sole initiates the self-lacing mechanism, strapping you in without needing to touch the shoes yourself. If you do want to adjust it, you can turn on the lights, adapt the tightness and check the battery using buttons on the upper. Battery time is three hours with the lights on, or 'days' without the lights, and it takes three hours to recharge. WIRED 11.16 – on sale now WIRED’s latest issue focuses on big ambition.

INTERVENTO DELLA GUARDIA DI FINANZA CONTRO IL MOTORE DI RICERCA - Il tema dell'evasione fiscale sarà affrontato stasera ad ampio raggio nel corso della trasmissione di Rai 3, Report, la quale affronterà anche la situazione che riguarda alcuni colossi del web. Non è passata inosservata, nei mesi scorsi, la notizia secondo la quale a finire nel mirino della Guardia di Finanza e della procura di Milano ci sarebbero anche alcuni colossi della rete, da Amazon a Facebook fino a Google. Lo rendeva noto lo scorso gennaio il quotidiano La Stampa in merito alla situazione fiscale relativa al celebre motore di ricerca di Mountain View al quale la Guardia di Finanza ha contestato un'evasione che oscilla tra i 227 ed i 300 milioni di euro. "Noi rispettiamo le normative fiscali in tutti i Paesi in cui operiamo. Continuiamo a lavorare con le autorità competenti", sarebbe stata la replica di Google dopo l'avvio delle dovute ispezioni della Finanza alla luce del fatturato della società in Italia pari ad oltre 2 miliardi a fronte del quale al fisco sarebbero stati versati solo 2 milioni. A finire nel vortice dell'evasione fiscale anche altri importanti nomi, come accaduto prima ancora ad Apple. GOOGLE & FACEBOOK, EVASIONI MILIONARIE PER I DUE COLOSSI DEL WEB: AL VIA CONTROLLI FISCALI (REPORT, 17 OTTOBRE 2016) - Siamo ormai nel mondo ad alta velocità per la connessione dati e nel web, come in qualsiasi altro regno, esistono due forze quasi incontrastate. Due colossi che non solo sono presenti nella vita di milioni di persone in tutto il mondo, ma hanno un potere ineguagliabile: Google e Facebook. Il loro potere si potrebbe definire quasi illimitato, dato che i loro archivi racchiudono i dati sensibili di tutti gli utenti, dai gusti personali alle scelte per gli acquisti, fino ai dati anagrafici di tutti coloro che si conoscono. Questa sera, lunedì 17 ottobre 2016, Report e Rai 3 approfondiranno le multinazionali del web dal punto di vista fiscale. Risale, infatti, a poche settimane fa la notizia scandalo che ha colpito la Apple, un altro magnate di internet, riguardo all'evasione fiscale di 13 miliardi di euro ai danni dell'Irlanda. Ma non è la sola: Google e Facebook sono le due piattaforme a raccogliere l'85% delle campagne pubblicitarie on line ed hanno un valore di mercato di quasi mille miliardi di dollari. Eppure, proprio nei Paesi in cui registrano i profitti e si trovano le sedi legali, Google e Facebook non pagano le tasse. L'azienda di Mark Zuckerberg è finita nel mirino della Guardia Finanza in questi ultimi giorni, a causa di un buco di 1,7 milioni di dollari che non avrebbe versato nel 2010, un numero che è destinato forse a crescere. Sul capo di Facebook pende infatti un'inchiesta fiscale che risalirà anche al fatturato degli anni successivi. Anche in questo caso si parla dell'Irlanda ed il trasferimento di fondi nel Paese per approfittare delle minori tasse per le imprese. Più forte invece il peso che grava su Google, pari a 400 miliardi di euro di tasse non pagate. Nello scorso settembre, l'ufficio di riscossione tasse dell'Indonesia ha infatti ultimato una verifica su Google, ma è ancora al vaglio la multa che potrebbe essere comminata dal governo sterno. L'accusa è di aver pagato meno dello 0,1% delle tasse totali, un dato che potrebbe confermare l'evasione, avvenuta nel 2015.  © Riproduzione Riservata.   SEGNALA STAMPA COMMENTA QUESTO ARTICOLO ULTIM'ORA 7.20 Cinema, Televisione e Media STEFANO BETTARINI/ L’ex calciatore di nuovo in prima serata: cosa ha fatto nella casa?

Not only are many teachers using tablets and computers for classroom instruction, but many state tests are now administered on computers, adding incentive for teachers to teach digital reading strategies. But casual digital reading on the internet has instilled bad habits in many students, making it difficult for them to engage deeply with digital text in the same way they do when reading materials printed on paper. Devin Hess sympathizes with educators’ concerns, but believes digital reading is here to stay and teachers have a duty to equip students to engage with digital texts in meaningful ways. Hess was a middle school social studies teacher and early tech adopter in his classroom. Now he works with the UC Berkeley History-Social Science Project training social studies teachers on deep reading strategies. The techniques were developed by the Project for reading on paper, but Hess has worked to extend and further them in the digital space.* “I don’t believe technology should ever be taught separately,” Hess said. Most of what he helps teachers learn are plain old good reading strategies, but he tries to highlight how practicing them in the digital space can make feedback easier and help students go further in their thinking. ‘The goal in almost all the strategies is to slow the kids down so they are focusing on this text.’Devin Hess, technology integration coach “The world is almost forcing us to go there,” Hess said. He sees deep digital reading as a new kind of literacy and a crucial one for the academic environment, as well as for students who will grow up to be adult citizens interacting with digital text as they move through their daily lives. Many of his strategies resonate with teachers because they are based in research about how students have always made sense of difficult texts and are only enhanced by a few digital affordances. “I’m sure you’ve had the experience of thinking about a problem and then you talk to someone else,” Hess said. “Just the nature of conversation impacts your comprehension.” Discourse is at the center of the strategies he teaches, which is why he’s not a fan of one-to-one programs that isolate kids on individual computers practicing rote skills through software. To him, that usage of technology doesn’t capitalize on the powerful learning that happens in social, collaborative spaces. “There is that danger of silencing that discourse, to the degree that teachers were using it anyway,” Hess said. He acknowledges that too few teachers know how to effectively facilitate academic discussions in classrooms, and that often “turn and talk to a partner” devolves into “turn and gossip.” But those issues have always existed in classrooms and aren’t the fault of technology. In fact, Hess maintains that to be a good teacher who uses technology, a person must first be a good teacher. Technology won’t repair those gaps. READING ON PAPER VS. READING DIGITALLY Reading print media is undeniably different from reading digital content. Researchers have been trying to understand how and why people interact differently with the two media and have shown that when students read online they comprehend less. But there isn’t enough longitudinal data to know if those deficits can be remediated by learning strategies specific to digital content. Those who prefer reading in print talk about the ability to flip pages, write in the margins and that they remember a scene based on where it was located on the page. It’s more of a linear experience and readers interact with it in specific ways. In contrast, digital reading takes place on a flat screen and the ability to hyperlink to related content makes the experience feel more like stream of consciousness than like a linear reading experience. It takes more self-control to stay focused when reading digitally, a challenge for many students used to quickly navigating around the Web. “It’s an amazing thing, but it also causes a lot of fragmentation,” Hess said. The key to getting kids to read deeply in any format is to have them engage with the text in meaningful ways. In the digital space, that means disrupting a pattern of skipping around, writing short chats and getting lost down the rabbit hole of the internet. It means teaching kids ways to break down a complex text, find key ideas, organize them and defend them. Practicing those skills in class can be time-consuming, but it also builds good digital reading habits that hopefully become second nature. “The goal in almost all the strategies is to slow the kids down so they are focusing on this text,” Hess said. “Number two is to engage them in an active way with the text, and number three you want to encourage oral discourse. And number four you want them to do some reflection.” Those steps should sound familiar to teachers because they are important for any kind of reading for comprehension and analysis. The trick for teachers is to learn how to transfer these processes into the digital space and push them even further. “HEADINGS AND HIGHLIGHT” STRATEGY Most of Hess’ tricks are easy to do in Google Docs, a free tool many schools are adopting because it’s easy for students to access their work anywhere. In this strategy, students have an excerpt of a difficult article open in Google Docs. First, the teacher asks students to read through on their own and highlight words they don’t now. This is basic decoding work. After everyone is on the same page with the vocabulary, teachers can ask pairs of students to read a paragraph together and highlight key ideas. As they do this, they’ll have to discuss why they believe those parts are important. After they have a few minutes to do this activity, the teacher can ask them to individually devise a four-word heading for that portion of the text based on the main ideas they’ve highlighted. They can type their heading into the Google Doc and then compare the headings each created. “If you came up with something different, you have to now justify why yours is better,” Hess said. Once again, students have to defend their thinking using text. “Making that heading has forced us to dig into the text,” Hess said. The teacher can then ask for all the agreed-upon headings and pair different groups together so that four students have to discuss their headings and come to consensus on the single best representation of the main ideas. “When you walk around and listen, what the kids are talking about is the text,” Hess said. At the end, the teacher might have groups present or even have the whole class vote on their favorite heading. And individually students can reflect on the process they went through, how the heading helps them understand the reading, and how it helps them answer the driving question of the unit. Hess is the first to admit that this strategy could easily be done with paper and pencil. The only real affordance of the technology is the ability to change the heading multiple times in a clean way. But it does help teachers see how to bring dialogue and discussion into the classroom, even when students are reading on the computer, and it has achieved the goal of slowing down reading. When students practice this method they may internalize it as well and start looking for the main idea in each paragraph as they read. “Part of it is getting kids to be thinking about why they are reading something,” Hess said. Often kids will read an entire paragraph, understand all the words in it, but never slow down to make meaning or look for main ideas. This basic reading strategy forces them to do so. Once students can identify the main idea of a reading, the next task is to understand the flow of the ideas and to connect concepts. The “Document outline” tool in Google Docs can be an easy and effective way to ask students to pick out evidence that supports the main ideas they’ve found. When this tool is turned on, students can write a heading for the paragraph or group of paragraphs and select “Heading 1” from the drop-down menu. When they come across a sentence or phrase that represents evidence supporting that main idea, they summarize it and label it “Heading 2.” Meanwhile, along the side of the Google Doc an outline will automatically populate with main ideas in Heading 1 and supporting evidence nested below in Heading 2. At the end, the whole essay is outlined and can be “exported to table of contents,” which will put it at the top of the document, where it can be used as a jumping-off point for writing. The technology didn’t do any of the thinking for students, but in this case the software helped build an outline as students discuss and winnow down their evidence, and their work has been conveniently saved in an easy-to-review manner. That makes initiating writing — often hard for students — much easier. And the headings in the outline are links that automatically skip to the part of the text where students inserted that heading. “You’ve created an active document,” Hess said. Even better in Hess’ mind, when a teacher sees an outline like this he or she can easily tell if the student understood the reading. To create the outline students have to comprehend the text; decoding isn’t enough. Hess says he uses this strategy all the time when reading documents for his own work because it’s useful, not just a tedious exercise to force kids to slow down. If a school or teacher isn’t using Google Docs, a similar type of “talking to the text” can be achieved using Diigo, which also allows users to share marked-up documents with one another that include comments or highlights. HIGHLIGHTING STRATEGY Students have been highlighting print texts for a long time, but anyone who has picked up an old copy of a high school text knows that sometimes the various highlights can get confusing. Teachers sometimes try to organize students by having them highlight different concepts in different colors, but the text can end up quite messy and hard to read after all that highlighting. Hess worked with a student to improve on a “highlighter tool,” Google Doc add-on that the student created in his computer science class. The tool lets users create individualized highlighters in different colors. So, for example, all the text that supports “Argument #1” might be in red, while the evidence in “Argument #2” might be in green, and so on. The highlights can be exported by color, which creates a table with all the ideas. Hess often suggests that students then add another column to the highlighter table, where they can write summaries of everything in that highlighted category. “It helps them discern between different things, and secondly, you’ve asked them to summarize what they’ve done,” Hess said. That provides good reflection and consolidation of the information they just picked out. Since some kids have difficulty prioritizing what to highlight, a teacher could limit the number of items for each color. In this case, the highlighting strategy is made much easier and more effective because it is digital. The various colors are labeled so the student doesn’t need a key to decipher highlights and all the information can be exported in one table, rather than having to sift back through the entire article. Hess warns that many of these strategies should first be taught using a text that isn’t a difficult cognitive lift for students so they can learn the reading strategy and the digital tools without also having to puzzle their way through a difficult text. A new tech tool and a new learning challenge at the same time are a recipe for frustration. While these strategies take time, they also get students deeply engaged with texts that may be difficult for them. Digital tools that modify articles for different reading levels, like Newsela, have a time and a place — like getting students on the same page about a topic so they can debate — but there are drawbacks to offering students only texts at their level. “If you are constantly bringing it down, you lose some of the richness,” Hess said. And challenging texts that force students to struggle also help them grow. “You can have someone reading a very complex text if you can scaffold it,” Hess said. TEACHER REACTIONS Evelyn Cervantes is an eighth-grade social studies teacher at Bret Harte Middle School in San Jose, California. Although located in the heart of Silicon Valley, the school only has a few laptop carts that all the teachers share. Cervantes knows many of her students are online at home a lot and she wants to make sure the lower-income students the school also serves are learning good digital skills when at school. In the past she experimented with showing videos in class and using a polling app, but wasn’t very impressed with how those tools impacted learning for her students. “I felt like it was very much about giving information to the kids, so more delivery of information, and not much beyond that,” Cervantes said. She has been pushing herself to use some of the strategies Hess taught her and likes the way they require students to engage deeply with text. She’s tired of students copying and pasting text without doing any analysis. “The strategies make it so that students have to slow down and analyze what they’re reading,” Cervantes said. She also noticed that when kids had their own computers they often didn’t really engage in dialogue when they were asked to share with a partner. Instead, they would merely share their screens. In response she halved the number of computers in the room, so pairs of students would have to share. After that modification she started to see much more robust dialogue. Cervantes says although many of the strategies Hess taught her could be done on paper, she likes using Google Docs because the outlines and annotations students create during class can easily become their notes. She can review them and return them quickly, touching on common themes or helping to point out holes in the thinking of the class. Hess emphasizes that all these digital reading tools must be used within the context of bigger, interesting questions, or else the strategies just become a list of steps. While Socratic seminars can take a lot of preparation, students are identifying main ideas, categorizing evidence and highlighting important passages in the service of an argument that they care about, which makes the whole process more meaningful. A New Yorker article dedicated to the question of whether students read as deeply on digital devices as in print focuses on the work of Maryanne Wolf, as well as others studying the space. Several studies found the decrease in comprehension on digital devices was more due to distractions on the internet than to the medium itself. Perhaps self-control is among the key skills to teach students expected to read more online. In the article, Maria Konnikova ends on a hopeful note: “Wolf is optimistic that we can learn to navigate online reading just as deeply as we once did print—if we go about it with the necessary thoughtfulness. In a new study, the introduction of an interactive annotation component helped improve comprehension and reading strategy use in a group of fifth graders. It turns out that they could read deeply. They just had to be taught how.” *This article has been updated to clarify that many of these strategies were first developed as paper-based strategies by the UC Berkeley History-Social Science Project.

Students need to be thinking deeply as they read, particularly with digital text! So many of our contracts, work docs, periodicals, and forms will be digital; students need to know how to slow down and process these texts on a screen if they expect to be successful adults. Tan Huynh I LOVE this highlighting strategy. Thank you, Katrina for sharing it. I have my ELs read digitally in Google Docs, but never thought of highlighting as a form of second close reading of the text. The different color coding and labeling is helpful because it offers a quick visual way to categorize ideas. Before engaging in Deeper Reading, I have my students digitally annotate the text sentence-per-sentence. In this image, Shungo chooses to switch between annotating in English and annotating in Japanese. The process is use before Deeper Reading is called Visible Reading, which is a form of guided reading to establish comprehensible input of the text http://www.empoweringells.com/2016/09/02/a3-making-reading-visible-to-ells/. I will definitely use this strategy the next time I use Kelly Gallagher’s Deeper Reading process. Regardless if the text is read digitally or in print, the Deeper Reading process asks students to slow down their reading and return to specific points in the text for a specific purpose. This process has helped my ELs significantly in 1) comprehending texts 2) thinking critically about the text and 3) develops their communication skills because students collaborate to construct meaning. I wrote about the process, which includes photos and videos, in this post http://www.empoweringells.com/2016/08/20/a-1-five-steps-o…s-deeper-reading/ Thanks again, Katrina! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e2429e940285441e1cb3ff8bc2265e31904a9233d7dda11ffb20687e4ffcdb26.png Ron Abate When students are aware that an assessment of their comprehension will follow the reading of a passage, they are more likely to read and reread “deeply.” The assessment can be a written summary of what was read or a quiz in multiple choice format. Also, knowledge of results can be a strong motivator. Actively Learn Team .. Author Katrina Schwartz Katrina Schwartz is a journalist based in San Francisco.

Well, we will leave that for you to decide. However, only to add fuel to the flames, Google, the search engine giant has unveiled two new smartphones namely the Pixel and Pixel XL. SEE ALSO: Here's How to Get Reliance Jio Barcode on 3G Phones [5 Easy Steps] Google decided to jettison the Nexus series of smartphones which are widely known to offer the best Android experience owing to the new Pixel series. Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, in a post stated that "The last 10 years have been about building a world that is mobile-first, turning our phones into remote controls for our lives." SEE ALSO: Top 5 Latest Dual-Lens Camera Smartphones in the market He added that "In the next 10 years, we will shift to a world that is AI-first, a world where computing becomes universally available - be it at home, at work, in the car, or on the go." But, does it really bring the innovation we need to the table. How does the Nexus 6P's replacement stack up against Apple iPhone 7 Plus in terms of metamorphosis? Let's find out. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Is omission of the headphone jack a step towards the future? Apple, not even for once, has taken a step backward when it comes to getting rid of tech it deems to be passé. For instance, the good old Floppy disk was replaced by USB since Steve Jobs regarded it archaic. In what appears to be a similar approach, Apple recently omitted the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. All the criticism apart, don't you think the headphone jack has been there with us for a while now? Sure, the wireless technology is in its nascent stages, it's quite expensive comparatively, and moreover, we are already content with whatever the 3.5mm jack can achieve. But, we've got to explore other options to progress, right? Moreover,Apple had proved time and again that it had been correct in its decisions to renounce obsolete technology. On the other hand, with the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google still continues to offer the ubiquitous 3.5mm headphone jack. Although we are not nitpicking about it since it seamlessly does what it's supposed to do, if merely seen from what new it brings to the table, certainly there isn't much. Does the highest DxOMark rating label mean something innovative? While we haven't gotten lucky to see the Google Pixel XL's camera in action just yet, according to what The Verge Reports, it has the highest DxOMark rated camera any smartphone has ever sported hitherto. But, does that mean the camera on the Pixel XL anything new as opposed to what we see on other flagships or, for that matter, its arch rival - the Apple iPhone 7 Plus? Well, we are afraid the answer is no. This, by any means, is not to belittle the Pixel XL's camera capabilities. On the flip side, Apple's iPhone 7 Plus rocks a dual camera setup at the back which Apple touts to be on par with the results you'd get from the images captured by a DSLR camera. Additionally, it offers support for 2x optical telephoto and a portrait mode which is capable of creating a greater sense of depth (the bokeh effect). While the dual camera setup on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus is not entirely a new tech (as far as the smartphone world is concerned), a few modes like the ones mentioned above are what makes it different and innovative. Click Here for New Android Smartphones Best Online Deals 3D Touch and Solid State Home button Despite rumours pointing towards a 3D Touch-like feature on the new set of Google smartphones, Pixel and Pixel XL doesn't offer any similar feature. And since it is a hardware feature, it is highly improbable for both of these smartphones to get support for this functionality via future Android updates. For those who are not in the know, Apple introduced the 3D Touch display (a pressure sensitive screen) back in 2015 with the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. This tech allows the iPhones to differentiate between a hard press and a light press thereby offering different functionalities. Apart from killing the headphone jack, Apple has also killed the physical home button in favour of a Solid State Home button which simulates a mechanical button press. It makes use of Apple's Taptic Engine haptic feedback to provide such results. The battle of Artificial Intelligence At the heart of the Google Pixel series smartphones is the Google Assistant. Unlike the Apple's Siri whose functionality seems to be annoyingly restricted, Google Assistant can pretty much handle most of the tasks you throw at it to help you get things done. And this is what makes it special about the Pixel series smartphones. Like stated by Mr Pichai, this paradigm shift marks the company's journey towards an AI-first world. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Verdict Let's get this straight out of the way, Apple's new additions or the removal (pun intended), while not perfectly feasible in the current day scenario, points at a step towards the future. On the other hand, Google, instead of experimenting, follows a safe approach which is quite understandable since it's company's first effort to manufacture a smartphone inside and out. From what appears from above, Apple seems to be slightly ahead in the league but we believe Google will catch up (or may be leave behind) Apple in the near future.

Alex Kras Home Top Posts Resume Projects Contact/Social Google May Be Stealing Your Mobile Traffic October 15, 2016 by Alex Kras 73 Comments Update 10/17/2016 6:30pm: You can read a response from the tech lead of the AMP Project for Google, in the comment area. Update 11/01/2016 10:40pm: After learning more about AMP, it became clear that the original title was inaccurate. A better title would have been You may be losing Your Mobile Traffic. Update 11/03/2016 10:30pm: I was invited to have lunch with Google AMP team, where I got to discuss some of my concerns. I’ve summarized my key takeaways here. I run my blog on WordPress with a custom theme. 6 month ago I’ve added support for Accelerate Mobile Pages (AMP) in order to provide better user experience for mobile devices. I did not research the AMP project well and have made some costly false assumptions that I wanted to share. Most importantly, I was surprised to find out that instead of redirecting users to an optimized version hosted on my server, Google was actually serving a snapshot of the page from their own cache. To make things worse, Google was injecting a large toolbar at the top of the snapshot encouraging users to get back to Google search results (a functionality already provided by the back button) and making it harder to get to the original site. To draw a contrast, Google have been keeping snapshots of sites for a very long time, available via a “cache” link right next to search results. The cache link, however, was optional. Clicking on the search result, traditionally, would take the user to the original source. With AMP, Google have turned this equation around. I do believe that Accelerated Mobile Pages is a great project! At the same time, I find the way Google handles redirects slightly dishonest and very concerning. Accelerated Mobile Pages Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) is a newish open source project that Google launched in the February of 2016. In their own words: AMP is a way to build web pages for static content that render fast. AMP in action consists of three different parts: AMP HTML is HTML with some restrictions for reliable performance and some extensions for building rich content beyond basic HTML. The AMP JS library ensures the fast rendering of AMP HTML pages. The Google AMP Cache can be used to serve cached AMP HTML pages. You can watched this promotional video to learn more about the project. Most Web Developer would recognize the suggested list of features (listed below) as a great thing. Allow only asynchronous scripts Size all resources statically Keep all third-party JavaScript out of the critical path All CSS must be inline and size-bound Font triggering must be efficient Minimize style recalculations Only run GPU-accelerated animations Prioritize resource loading Load pages in an instant As an added bonus, it was rumored that Google will prioritize AMP optimized pages in their search results, so there was really no downside in giving it a try. Or so I thought. AMP In Action I run my blog on WordPress, so it was really easy to add AMP support via the AMP plugin. I remember bragging that it took less than 5 minutes to set it up, saying “Google wants, Google gets”. I’ve been running my site with AMP support for over 6 months now. If you head over to Google and search for “Git Tips” you will see my site with the APM icon next to it. Clicking on that link will open up AMP friendly view of the post. The Problem So far everything seems great, with one big problem. The view above is not being served from my site, but rather from Google Cache. The URL of the page looks as follows: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.alexkras.com/19-git-tips-for-everyday-use/amp/?client=safari Essentially, the original link with www.google.com/amp/s/ added in front of it. Which is actually a good thing. It reduces load on my site and allows readers to access to the information much faster that my $10 a month server could accommodate. So Why in the world am I complaining, even going as far as to imply that Google might be stealing my mobile traffic? Guess what happens when the “close” button is clicked inside the AMP view? I was expecting it to cause a redirect to the original article. Instead it redirects back to Google search results. Say What? How are people supposed to get to my site? Luckily in my case there is a blue header at the top, clicking on which would redirect to the homepage. I have seen a number of sites, however, that do not have such header. In those cases, I literally had to copy the URL and paste it into my browser to get to the original site. I am afraid that most readers are not willing to go through that trouble. Also note that even with the header in place, landing on the home page will make it really hard to locate the original article returned via the Google search. One final nitpick. If Google cares so much about the mobile experience, why cover 15% of the small mobile screen with a fat bar at the top? What about the little guy or gal? If you watched the AMP promotional video, you’ve heard them talk about the web as the greatest innovation of our time. Except the user experience was broken on mobile and AMP set out to fix just that. I think Richard Gingras, Head of News at Google, said it best and I quote: “Let’s make the web great again“. Note: To be fair, Richard Gingras said it way before Donald Trump made it his campaign slogan. Still I couldn’t resist to point that coincidence out. Unfortunately, in the process of fixing the Web, Google broke something else. It used to work like this: Search Google Find interesting result Go to the site Explore the site further OR hit the back button to go back to Google search results Now it works like this: Search Google Find interesting result Read the content without leaving Google Try to explore the original site AND get redirected back to Google search results. The web used to be the place where anybody could publish quality content, help thousands of people, and earn a few dollars along the way. Google Adsense was one of the main products that made this reality possible. A lot of authors hope that people would find their content useful, stay for a while and come back in the future. None of this will work if readers are not able to get to the site in the first place. In addition, given the wide spread of Ad Blocking software, mobile platform remains one of few places where ad revenue continues to be a viable option. By hijacking the mobile traffic and keeping users from leaving their site, Google gets to benefit from somebody else’s content while at the same time displaying their ads. This cuts further into already narrow margins of independent publishers. What can be done? Ask Google to give users an easy option to view the original post. Google could change the close button to take users to the original site. Alternatively, a different button can be added to provide users with such option. Make sure your AMP content is optimized for the new deal I think it is important to point out that Google is playing by the AMP rules. My main concern is that a lot of people (like myself a week ago) have yet to realize that AMP search results are being treated differently from other search results. In other words, Google is playing by the rules, but the rules have changed. When I installed the AMP plugin, I assumed that all my setting from my main site will carry over. This was not the case. The AMP plugin extracted the text content and stripped everything else out. I noticed some of it, but did not, for example, realized that it removed my Analytics code. I wasn’t too concerned with the changes that I did notice, because I assumed that users will have an easy way to drop back to my original site. As of writing of this article, there is no such option. That being said, Google allows AMP sites to display whatever content they like, as long as it complies with AMP rules. I recommend each AMP enabled side to do the following Make sure your Analytics tracking code is properly installed Make sure you have a header that points back to your main site If your site has a menu, make sure it is visible in the AMP version Consider adding a link at the top of your AMP page, giving user an option to visit the original post Make sure your ads and other promotional material is properly integrate into the AMP version Conclusion I hope I am not being too hard on Google. I get it. Real innovation is hard. It takes courage. No one can get everything right on the first try and it’s easy to overlook some details. Since AMP is an open source project, I assume my feedback is welcomed. That being said, it’s the people, millions of authors who take their time to write and billions of readers who take their time to read, comment and share that make the Web great. Google is improving things for the mobile readers with the AMP project. I only wish they could do so without hurting the content creators. P.S. This post has generated an interesting discussion on Hacker News, with some good examples both supporting and opposing my arguments.

At first I thought it’s my browsers fault, now I see it’ s the usual “GOOGLE” doing whatever it wants to the internet! So this is an honest end-user opinion about this whole Amp thing! Reply Dave Archer says October 29, 2016 at 8:30 am does AMP reduce any adsense/other advertising revenue in anyway.? Reply Malte Ubl says October 29, 2016 at 10:37 am AMP pages are web pages that you publish yourself and where you configure the ads in the way you want. AMP puts some restrictions on ads (e.g. no popups) and on the other hand, the fast loading may help users actually see more of your ads. There was a recent blog post providing more details https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2016/10/26/do-more-with-ads-on-amp/amp/ Reply AJ Kohn (@ajkohn) says October 20, 2016 at 10:32 am I think there are a lot of misconceptions around AMP and also about what success is going to look like in the future. First off, an AMP view is a ‘visit’ to your site – it’s just a super speedy version cached by Google. If you have analytics configured you’ll see these as visits to your site. The question will be about engagement when users are interacting on this version of your content. That’s a fair question. But then the goal is to have content and a layout that encourages users to click-through on that AMP page to your mobile site. Google’s primary customer are search users. And I don’t think they’re looking for Google to put flashing signs that say ‘explore this site’ or ‘go to this site’s home page’. So asking for these types of things doesn’t seem in line with the goal of search users and thereby Google. But I agree that having good navigation at the top is critical. Being able to quickly get to the information you’re looking for is what users want. I somehow doubt if you interviewed folks and said that when you’re looking for ‘how to stain a redwood fence’ that you want to see that content and THEN explore the site a bit more to read other articles etc. And if I did there’s an easy way to do so. I think the future of mobile search may not even include links to click on at all but simply swiping through content. http://www.blindfiveyearold.com/the-future-of-mobile-search Right now they’re not putting the AMP pages in a carousel but they could. They have in some other iterations. So thinking hard about what and why users would click for more and designing for that is where I’d focus. Granted doing all of this with just a WP Plug-In is … going to be difficult. And as such the sites with development resources will get ahead of those who don’t. Reply Steve Floyd says October 19, 2016 at 1:01 pm I’ve noticed the URLs that AMP content was being served up from was coming from Googles cache. The easy solution is: Google don’t stop doing that. Serve up people’s content from their own servers. Fast loading pages are great. What AMP is shaping up to be (in the hands of Google), not so much. Reply Mike Dobbs says October 18, 2016 at 11:38 am Very good points in this article, and it’s a clear design by Google to keep users coming back to their SERPs. In fact. the same situation occurs regardless of AMP when users search from the Google Search App. Similar to AMP, Google’s Search App will no longer let me have “Chrome” as my default browser. So, when I click on any result AMP or regular, it brings it up in a generic browser (not sure what it’s call) and make it logical to hit the X when you are done reading that specific page. Then, it takes you back to the Google SERP which get’s updated with a new set of grey carousal suggestions for “people also searched for”… Reply Ben says October 18, 2016 at 8:49 am That WordPress plugin is very significant in AMP uptake by news publishers – see this analysis: http://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/06/20/a-look-around-the-world-at-how-news-websites-are-adopting-googles-amp-html/#64da63ba13e3 Reply Mail says October 18, 2016 at 3:18 am Well, AMP is very young technology, apart from some “heavy-HTML”-sites (large publishing houses) i haven’t seen many sites on which it was actually rolled out. You said it on your own: Innovation is tricky – so its the same with AMP. Give Google a little more time, they will improve it, i’m sure – this thing is that young that i can’t even walk… My concerns are currently much more regarding the to-be-included JS-file with a size of ~180kb, IIRC – outside the US, mobile connections are not that fast, having to have included an additional file with that size is -currently- just overkill for most (mainly) static webpages – i understand why a large publishing house like NYT may get some benefits of it, but for a “standard page” which lists just some text + images as content, it’s -yet- not worth the additional overhead of this JS file. (sure, take a look at your favorite debugging tool: NYT’s page et. al. is what you would call typically >overloaded<) Regards Reply Truffleweb says October 17, 2016 at 11:27 pm It’s a bit of an unnecessary whinge with a click bait title really… Reply Siddharth Kulkarni says October 17, 2016 at 10:57 pm This is a really click baity article. Should have done more research before putting that title. Reply Alex Hope says October 17, 2016 at 7:23 pm I like the idea of AMP, majority of hits to my website right now are coming directly from mobile devices, but as outlined in this post it is becoming increasingly difficult for the “average” blogger to tailor AMP to his own needs in a way that wouldn’t interfere with basic homepage functionality. At this time, it’s too much for starter bloggers to pay any attention to this project because the user experience is still a little bit choppy. Thanks for the writeup though, nice to see someone from the official team give a legit response. Reply Malte Ubl says October 17, 2016 at 5:56 pm Hey, this is Malte and I am the tech lead of the AMP Project for Google. While I work on the AMP open source project, I did check back with the Google Search team that is more directly responsible for most of the points mentioned in the post. I personally find it very important to respond, because “stealing traffic” is literally the opposite of what AMP is for. The original idea behind AMP was to allow content to be distributed to platforms (such as Google, Twitter and Pinterest) in a way that retains branding and monetization control for the publisher. AMP traffic is the publisher’s traffic. Period. I also realize that “just turning on the WordPress plugin” doesn’t get you there. Especially if a WordPress installation is heavily customized, one will need to invest similar effort to get the AMP pages to the same quality. While this may be a lot of work, this is by design: We recommend to really optimize AMP pages and fine tune them to your needs. AMP is not a templated format for that reason. While neither the AMP project, nor Google are directly responsible for the WordPress plugin, the AMP open source project working closely with the authors of the plugin(s) to improve the quality and scope. AMP is very flexible and should be capable of providing most features of a typical WordPress site, but this flexibility also requires respective work to make custom plugins and development show up in the AMP version. Getting more literal about “stealing traffic”: there are audience measurement platforms that attribute traffic to publishers. They might in theory wrongly attribute AMP traffic to the AMP Cache (not Google) rather than to a publisher because they primarily use referrer information. That is why we worked with them in worldwide outreach to get this corrected (where it was a problem), so that traffic is correctly attributed to the publisher. If this is still a problem anywhere, AMP treats it as a highest priority to get it resolved. “Ask Google to give users an easy option to view the original post.” Let us start by saying that we love URLs as much as everyone else, and we tried hard to make the AMP URL scheme as usable as possible given the technical constraints of web apps. We’re looking at ways to make the source link more discoverable and will update once that is done. AMP is super flexible in terms of how a publisher can direct traffic to their site. Typical ways to get to a publisher’s homepage (like clicking the logo) should just work and are in no way restricted. Also, make sure to check out amp-sidebar (https://ampbyexample.com/components/amp-sidebar/) for adding a menu to your AMP pages. If you are not comfortable with traffic on your AMP pages, please do not publish AMP pages. Google Search has 2 types of AMP related features: Normal search: AMP does not influence ranking. Your pages will appear in the same spot with or without AMP. AMP specific features (such as the “Top Stories Carousel”): For these features, we believe that AMP is the format that currently delivers the best possible user experience on the mobile web. That is because AMP allows for consistent speed, caching, pre-rendering, and enables swiping between full-length pages. This is a big deal for topics where there isn’t “that one best result” that a user might want to look at. “Google takes away ad revenue on AMP pages” AMP supports over 60 ad networks (2 of them are owned by Google) with 2-3 coming on board every week and makes absolutely no change to business terms whatsoever. There is no special revenue share for AMP. “If Google cares so much about the mobile experience, why cover 15% of the small mobile screen with a fat bar at the top?” The Android users might have already noticed that it is now scrolling out of the way and the same is coming soon for iOS (we’re just fighting a few jank issues in Safari). Similarly we’re spearheading a long term effort (https://github.com/bokand/NonDocumentRootScroller) to allow web apps to define how the address bar is hidden on scrolling. It looks like this will land in Chrome soon, providing even more space to web pages. Reply Malte Ubl says October 17, 2016 at 5:58 pm PS: I actually do own that hat! https://goo.gl/photos/MsYDTVe8t6icM1218 Reply Alex Kras says October 17, 2016 at 6:27 pm Thanks for the update! “We’re looking at ways to make the source link more discoverable and will update once that is done.” This really was my main concern/criticism of the project. I am looking forward to learning what you’ll come up with. There rest was just a public service announcement, to make sure that other AMP users are not making same mistakes as I did. P.S. I can’t believe you own that hat, thats just too good. Reply Guillaume Balaine says October 18, 2016 at 12:48 am You are pretty based Reply Steven van Vessum says October 19, 2016 at 12:07 am “If you are not comfortable with traffic on your AMP pages, please do not publish AMP pages. Google Search has 2 types of AMP related features: Normal search: AMP does not influence ranking. Your pages will appear in the same spot with or without AMP.” “in the same spot” is a bit of a grey area. If you don’t jump on the AMP bandwagon, but your competition does, you’re bound to lose a lot of traffic. So yeah you have a choice, but since Google’s pushing AMP so hard you’ll lose out if you don’t join the party. Reply Stephen Petrey says October 17, 2016 at 6:09 pm “AMP does not influence ranking. Your pages will appear in the same spot with or without AMP.” Thanks for clearing that up, that was my number one concern initially! Cheers! Reply Angela Bowman says October 17, 2016 at 9:36 pm Thanks for clearing that up! I have noticed news stories appear at top with AMP, but now I do see that regular articles are intermixed with the AMP articles. The Wired article was a bit misleading on that one. Reply David Sottimano says October 17, 2016 at 11:14 pm Hang on, you might want to do some research first, i.e. scrape 100,000 mobile US serps and you’ll see preferential treatment for AMP very quickly. Google can get away by saying AMP isn’t a ranking factor, because they can get away with saying anything and people will believe it. The AMP carousel generally appears at the top of mobile serps, and while it may not be a ranking factor, you probably won’t ever get into the top 10 carousel spots without being AMP’d. Example: http://screencast.com/t/QH0sxslNaq. On the other hand, I do appreciate the engineers at Google, they are phenomenal, honest and always seem to act with the best intentions. Reply Bastian Fraune says October 18, 2016 at 2:50 am Thx Simon! Google forces you to AMP in long term. But not by saying it like that … And it’s clearly not Google’s fault that the site was cached on google.com/amp/…. Obviously a mistake in the WordPress environment… Reply Mersudin Forbes (@onlinehero) says October 18, 2016 at 6:01 am Doesn’t “yet” Reply Janne Koschinski says October 18, 2016 at 5:15 am AMP specific features (such as the “Top Stories Carousel”): For these features, we believe that AMP is the format that currently delivers the best possible user experience on the mobile web. That is because AMP allows for consistent speed, caching, pre-rendering, and enables swiping between full-length pages. This is a big deal for topics where there isn’t “that one best result” that a user might want to look at. That is a very problematic situation – you could have built a verifier tool that also allows other simple websites to be listed there, or competing standards (Instant Articles, the old Google Currents standards, etc) to be listed there, too. I’ll be making an Antitrust complaint to the EU regarding this, and I hope you’ll rethink your position on this. Reply Jerome says October 23, 2016 at 8:56 am Yes, Antitrust complaints are warranted in this case. The simple argument is as follows. While Google may have devised the protocol and tools, having the pages hosted on their servers AND returning users to the search page is creating a silo. In addition, the temptation to impact on page rank is like gravity; without knowing it is already impacting you – it is also extremely expensive to escape – and thus the whole exercise is contrary to liberal and open markets with level playing fields. The protocol should, at bare minimum allow the site to define whether the AMP page is to be served up by the site’s chosen server – or Google. Then, Google will HAVE to pay up for monitoring exercises on how AMP vs self-hosted-AMP vs non-AMP pages fare. Reply Ilaya says October 19, 2016 at 2:04 am Congratulations. You re-invented the RSS format that you really do not like because you cannot insert Adsense ads there) “Thank you” for making life more difficult for webmasters. Reply Ron Elliott says October 19, 2016 at 6:48 am How about also allowing the end user to disable this feature? Because I find using AMP annoying i’m currently using duckduckgo. Reply AMPSuckd says October 20, 2016 at 3:44 am I avoid visiting AMP pages because it invokes more feelings of rage from me than not, overshadows any of its perceived added value to the mobile UX. How ducking hard is it to add a link to the original non-AMP generated page? Seriously, I should not have to perform 3+ user actions and spend 10+ seconds to get the original page URL. Google Images provides a quick way to get to the original source, FFS. Reply Tameka says October 17, 2016 at 2:34 pm WTF. Stealing traffic … what does it matter, if the content is shown on your site or accelerated via google? It’s your content and it gets to the users. The users hopefully like it. That’s it. You’re even saving on traffic costs. People always complaining … just because you may not get stats in your webserver logs? Reply Alex Kras says October 17, 2016 at 2:46 pm Thanks, check out this discussion https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12722590 I think some of the comments may explain my concerns better than I did. Reply Nicholas Griffin says October 17, 2016 at 12:47 pm Yeah, that was pretty much the point of Google’s integration dude. They would serve pages from their server for instantaneous loading. If you don’t want that to happen, don’t let Google crawl your AMP urls, but then you are missing the entire point of AMP. Reply Greg Ichneumon Brown says October 17, 2016 at 12:37 pm You bring up a number of important things that feel like they are just bugs in how the WordPress AMP plugin works (not detecting that you are using analytics already and enabling the AMP analytics; having the AMP page provide more links to your site – maybe a basic “recent posts” section at the end of the post to keep the user on your site). Converting WP posts to AMP such that they work across all themes and support different plugins is a complicated problem, but one that is worth solving. It would be super helpful if you could distill some of this into issues or PRs on the project: https://github.com/Automattic/amp-wp I worked on some of the early work on that plugin verifying that WP.com stats would be correctly recorded when AMP pages are viewed. In general I think that AMP (as a spec) is designed in a way that can allow a site to be both very fast and very engaging to keep a user on your site (and have it be monetized if that’s what you want). The current plugin needs more work to do that in user friendly way though. Reply Greg Ichneumon Brown says October 17, 2016 at 4:08 pm Opened some issues around these: https://github.com/Automattic/amp-wp/issues/541 https://github.com/Automattic/amp-wp/issues/542 https://github.com/Automattic/amp-wp/issues/124#issuecomment-254360266 Reply Sean Fitzroy (@fitzroy) says October 17, 2016 at 12:07 pm Just had this happen with both Thrillist and the New Yorker. It was impossible to get to the actual page on mobile (and also impossible to scroll or dismiss the popup on the AMP version of the New Yorker). Very frustrating. Reply Ricardo Cordts Monteiro says October 17, 2016 at 9:35 am Hi Alex, When you try to update your post, how long it takes to update your AMP cached version? Reply Alex Kras says October 17, 2016 at 10:08 am I don’t know, but it’s a great question. Reply Stephen Petrey says October 17, 2016 at 12:40 pm I could be reading this documentation wrong, but it sounds like the AMP cache considers a resource fresh for at least 1 minute. Very interesting. (Thanks for the write-up by the way Alex!) https://developers.google.com/amp/cache/overview#google-amp-cache-updates Reply Simon Hayter says October 17, 2016 at 7:37 am I admit one of those designers who yet to jump on the AMP bandwagon… my excuse?… I question is long term survivability. Mobiles are getting faster and faster… We are already starting to see the likes of HEXA and OCTA cores powered phones on the market, with 10 and 12 core versions in 2017. A lot of new phones support 1080p or more, hell we even have 2K and 4K phones by Sony/LG. At pace of mobile development is moving very quickly as the demand is there, I can’t help think that AMP is just a waste of time. Bandwidth 4G addresses a lot of broadband speed issues, while not breath taking, for the majority of users its good enough, but with that said we have 5G only around the corner which is going to be just as fast, or faster as home broadband. 5G is planned for 2020 (only 3 years away, for users in the UK) and most likely sooner in other countries. Reply catcat5 says October 17, 2016 at 8:27 am It’s not just the speed. People are less and less inclined to browse to an un-trusted website or article on their phone, afraid of pop up ads, auto playing video ads that cannot be turned off, the volume suddenly shooting up. AMP is raising the quality of the mobile experience by promoting publishers to conform to a restrictive spec that promises these advertising tricks will not be part of the user experience. Users build confidence in the amp logo and are more likely to click on an amp article than a regular link, much like Facebook’s instant articles. Reply Simon Hayter says October 17, 2016 at 11:49 am I appreciate what your saying but the majority of consumers are unaware what AMP is, so I can’t see it building consumer confidence this decade. Its taken two decades to get people savvy on SSL, and even then the majority still don’t know about it. As far as user experience, studies reveal people want a similar experience to the desktop environment, not allowing developer scripts stripes away that ‘similar’ experience instantly. I’ll go on a limb here and say that the type of people currently who know what AMP is, and see it in search results are IT savvy enough to install Ad Blockers and Disable sound from auto playing and so on. Reply Red Rebel says October 28, 2016 at 2:01 pm Hello. Don’t go on a limb! Actually, you can bet a few beers… I am not a computer genius with a PhD. but I may be what you call IT savvy. I’m an electrician who resisted as long as possible before getting a smart phone. I always wanted a phone to make phone calls, and some sms, nothing else. Two years ago I was forced into the smart phones’ world… Regular phones no longer existed in my part of the world. So, in the last two years I learned as much as possible about Android. I discovered AMP yesterday night. This afternoon I did a lot of reading about it. Now, I can see the AMP sites in the search results. I can open the full complete website even though I am clicking/taping on the AMP link. And… yes, all video or audio don’t autoplay on my phone. For ad blocking, I use a firewall. My phone is stock Android, unrooted. But in the next few weeks that will change. I plan to go “black”: rooted, custom ROM, 100% untraceable, 100% anonymous. (see http://www.torproject.com and guardianproject.info ) All that, I learned reading different discussion websites where ideas and knowledge are exchanged between hackers. So, you can bet those beers, if I can do that in less than 2 years, others will do some or all of it also. Bye. Reply sunk818 says October 17, 2016 at 11:20 am Saying phones are getting faster and bandwidth is plentiful (which I have to pay for) as a reason to not optimize delivery is a lazy approach to programming. I like the speed of AMP enabled pages. Didn’t realize it was cached on Google, but it loads a lot faster on my iPhone 6 than a site that is not AMP enabled. Faster delivery of pages is directly related to increased site revenue and lower bounce rates. If you’re not going to make your web page AMP enabled, there’s evidence to prove that faster loading content benefits everyone. Reply Simon Hayter says October 17, 2016 at 11:53 am It’s possible to have a website load within a second, or two on a mobile device without AMP. Optimisation can occur outside the realm of AMP. Reply veeman says October 17, 2016 at 5:26 pm I hope you realize that not everyone has blazing fast internet speeds like we do in developed countries. A large (and rapidly increasing) number of web users are in developing nations like Nigeria and India who are using smartphones primarily and on very limited data. Having your website AMP-lified (?) can be a great benefit to getting your content out there. Reply Tom says October 17, 2016 at 7:15 am I prefer reading tool in Firefox mobile. It’s far better than AMP as it’s pretty easy to configure size and color of text/page. Further, FF can use adblocker on mobile. My and my clients’ sites are all full responsive. I uninstalled AMP long time ago. Google is like Apple was 3 years before: No innovations, building a wall around their services (which become more and more shitty). Same with Facebook, they’ve started serving more and more websites within their apps. They don’t use Android’s built-in brwoser engine or Chrome anymore sometimes. Just don’t use the shit if you don’t want it. Further, I hate AMP because I have to load sites now 3 times with manually editing the URL. Lots of sites are running WordPress, lots of WordPress articles offer you to comment them… So now I load the RSS, then load the AMP version, then edit the URL and delete /AMP/, then I can comment. Pretty fucking easy and revolutionary, isn’t it? Reply Jonny Darling says October 17, 2016 at 3:28 am Thank you for sharing Alex. Is there a risk of duplicate URLs with the /amp/ page versions? Reply Luuk Lamers says October 17, 2016 at 3:00 am If anything I think you’re being too soft on Google. They want you to use a proprietary technique and replace standards… That sounds a lot like the IE-only age. Adding to that Google Chrome’s popularity gives Google a lot of tools to become the monopolist that will eventually break the web. Everything AMP does is possible without using AMP (though a little harder to set up). But because AMP exists now, developer teams big and small will just plug in AMP instead of actually learning about performance improvements, what works and what doesn’t. The cache might be a good thing but proprietary stuff is never good for the web. It could only hurt us more in a future where Google can be as much of a problem as the Link Tax in keeping an Open Web. Reply veeman says October 17, 2016 at 5:30 pm Proprietary? AMP is completely open source and supported on all the major web browsers. Reply Luuk Lamers says October 28, 2016 at 3:11 am The closed Caching server that is used via a Google URL is not open source. Even worse, in scientific research this would be equal to plagiarism if there is no link back to the original content. How come students and scientists can’t do this and can get expelled/suspended or forced to resigned for doing it and Google gets a “get out of jail free card”? An alternative service like CloudFlare (CDN proxy) enables you to speed up your site too (and cache it) but has no penalty of different URLs. Reply Malte Ubl says October 28, 2016 at 7:48 am AMP is currently used in production by Google, Microsoft Bing, Pinterest, LinkedIn and many other platforms. The rules are the same for all these platforms. The AMP spec states “By using the AMP format, content producers are making the content in AMP files available to be crawled (subject to robots.txt restrictions), cached, and displayed by third parties.” https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-html-format.md#amp-html- Additionally, AMP documents re, of course, absolutely free to link to themselves at the origin location (this is very common. See for example CNN’s AMP files) and provide all typical mechanisms for onward journeys. There are also guidelines for AMP caches, defining what they can and cannot do https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-cache-guidelines.md Highlight worthy are: “Provides a faithful visual and UX reproduction of source document, although visually imperceptible changes in image resolution or compression rate are acceptable.” “No obstruction of the contents of the original AMP document.” “No changes to ads, access, analytics, or similar”. Reply Kristoffer (@h4emtfr) says October 17, 2016 at 2:17 am Hello, I have a quick question. Living in Sweden I don’t see any AMPed results at all but I assumed that clicking on the article would take me to the original version. Is this not the case? Reply Alex Kras says October 17, 2016 at 7:08 am I believe the issue that I am describing only applies to AMP labeled pages. Reply Drazen says October 17, 2016 at 12:37 am Something on a subject of saving web server traffic, and visitor’s data plans. You might be saving some site bandwidth and visitor’s data plan with AMP, but there’s Facebook’s in-app browser with it’s “prerender” feature that will successfully annihilate it all together. Anyone who has Facebook fanpage and regularly share links on FB should do this test: http://inchoo.net/dev-talk/magento-website-hammering-facebook-liger/ Reply James Cridland says October 16, 2016 at 2:54 am There is nothing to stop you from producing a proper, full-fat version of your site using AMP. Using a WordPress plugin is not the best way to go. My main (commercial) site is now a mix of AMP and HTML5. You can’t tell the difference when surfing the site. Reply akras14 says October 16, 2016 at 7:20 am Definitely and it’s my key takeaway. I just did not realized this when I was first introduced to AMP, and figured others may have the same problem. I also still have a funny feeling about Google serving my content from their cache. It’s fine now, but I am afraid that they will continue down this path destroying the web as we know it. Reply curtjohnson1968 says November 1, 2016 at 11:38 am AMP was a frustrating one as we still had to bring in a great coder to avoid all the issues brought up in the article. We made sure that we kept the ‘related articles’ and had those drive to the AMP version so as not to lose traffic for our pages but also to keep fast loading. What’s interesting is that we’re actually getting loads more traffic now from Apple News and Facebook Articles than AMP. We’re a new site and always had a ton of Google traffic with a fast loading responsive site, but thankfully we’re seeing that you don’t have to be so reliant on Google anymore with Apple News and Facebook thankfully. It would be frustrating in the past as we had to do everything Google said or pay the price of less traffic, but now we can diversify and not be so beholden to Big G which is a great blessing. Reply jarofgreen says October 16, 2016 at 12:12 am Your complaint about the behaviour of the close button on a AMP page, in taking you back to search results: honestly, that’s what I expect it to do. If I go to a page and then try and close it, fundamentally I don’t want to stay on the site. I want to leave the site. (Tho I do agree with “If Google cares so much about the mobile experience, why cover 15% of the small mobile screen with a fat bar at the top?” Why have the close bar/button at all? Just make sure the back button works as expected – which is both easy to do and is what everyone knows to do already. Anyway …) The use case of a person seeing the AMP page, but then wanting to see the non-AMP version of the same page: With respect, that’s a workflow a programmer wants to do. I don’t see non-tech people wanting to do that. When AMP is working properly, it should seamlessly fit with other content and mostly people shouldn’t notice. What I do see is a non-tech person opening the AMP page, liking the content and then wanting to browse around the rest of the site – as you discuss. I recommend each AMP enabled side to do the following 3. If your site has a menu, make sure it is visible in the AMP version This for me is the take away point here. (Also commented at https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/57q8co/google_may_be_stealing_your_mobile_traffic/ ) Reply akras14 says October 16, 2016 at 7:23 am I personally dislike other apps popping an internal browser between me and my link. Facebook app does it so does Gmail on iOS. There I have an option to open the link in the regular browser. Google cache experience felt very similar to me, except that I didn’t have an easily available option to get back to my regular flow. Reply David Sottimano says October 17, 2016 at 1:39 am @Jarofgreen I agree! Since that bar is there, you shouldn’t be returned to the non AMP version of the page on close, it doesn’t make sense. That bar shouldn’t be there! Users shouldn’t be taken to Google’s snapshot of Alex’s page, they should be taken to the AMP version of his page where the browser CLOSE option should mean that the browser session closes, as expected, as you stated. By serving Google’s version of Alex’s page, they have absolute control – they can inject anything they like, example: ads. It wouldn’t surprise me if Google started injecting Adwords into the cached version, which can be both equally good and bad for people like Alex. Good if there is profit sharing, bad for obvious reasons. Reply Angela Bowman says October 17, 2016 at 12:31 pm I perform Google searches on my phone frequently for articles and technical information. I am also one of those people who assumed that the X to close would mean that I was closing the Google header and thus allowing me to go to the real web page. The way this is working now makes it nearly impossible to get the real web page or web site and bookmark or share URLs. You end up sharing the Google search URL instead. The only way I’ve discovered to get to the real article if the site hasn’t taken the steps listed in this article seems to be to press and hold on the link the search results which causes a new tab to open with the real article. This is infuriating to me as I bookmark and share a lot of URLs throughout the day and now it’s a huge pain in the ass that no novice is going to be abel to work their way around. I do like the speed and cleanness of the pages but at the same time important content I am looking for is stripped. So Google is policing what content you can see, and, again novice users aren’t going to realize they are missing important content from the page. A big issue with all of this is that Google gets what Google wants. By prioritizing AMP pages in search results, we are all essentially forced to use it (or recommend it to clients if you are a web developer). It’s like being stuck between a rock and a hard place. You have to play by Google’s rules and now you’ve decreased the amount of sharing and bookmarking of your content. https://www.wired.com/2016/02/google-will-now-favor-pages-use-fast-loading-tech/ Reply steve says October 23, 2016 at 12:03 pm that’s a key deficiency from the user perspective – i too often share/reblog and until Dave Winer linked to this issue i hadn’t sussed what it was that had started interfering with my process (i don’t ever use ‘social” icons on a site, i need the actual URL) Reply Jon Price says October 23, 2016 at 12:05 pm This is where everything is moving for every Google search property. Google’s immersive search experience = the AOLificiation of Google search results, with the unique twist of outsourcing content creation to you and me. Look at the # of swipes to get to the actual local organic result of a website for a local business in your area… no different than as you said for AMP results “The way this is working now makes it nearly impossible to get the real web page or web site and bookmark or share URLs.” As a business or their seo, one has to determine what’s best: A. formatting everything to appear in the new interstitial wave of 1-3 layers of pure google-controlled results, coded precisely the way google wants by creating perfectly-formatted documents, or B. have your content buried 10 swipes deep where they finally enable the user to view a true #1 organic search result slot (…god forbid you’re #3 or #4, which isn’t even a thing these days). Google knows you’ll choose A because they have an equal balance of leverage between those who seek to achieve organic visibility and the supply of those who will simply pay for prominence. Anyone remember the process of getting to the actual web from inside an AOL-monetized channel back in 1996 or 97? Well, Google’s mobile version of search & the web is really no different than AOL Travel, or AOL Local or AOL Money channel where that walled ad garden could persist. It’s just an “optimized” experience that feels like a web page, when in reality it’s a filtered, strategically blurred line between search and web delivered in Google’s packaged format incorporating ad units. The smart move Google made that AOL didn’t is to outsource content for free by leveraging the content YOU create and YOU format just for them, purely for the (diminishing) benefit of showing up there.

After a brief introductory skit reminiscent of the “Silicon Valley” TV show, most of the event’s time was spent with various spokesmen and executives giving information about these new offeringss. The most notable announcement was the official unveiling of the Pixel smartphone. This device sports the latest version of the Android operating software “Nougat,” a 12.3 megapixel camera, unlimited cloud storage for pictures and a headphone jack that does not require a drill to access. The smartphones are currently available for pre-order and begin shipping on Oct. 20. The Pixel Phone, with a five inch screen and 32 GB of storage, costs $649 upfront. The Pixel XL, which features a five-and-a-half inch screen and 128 GB of storage, costs $749. By comparison, the IPhone 7 and 7 Plus have a price range of $649  for the 32 GB IPhone 7 to $969 for the 256 GB IPhone 7 Plus. The Daydream VR Headset was also spotlighted, noting Google’s expansion into the rapidly growing virtual reality marketplace. This lightweight headset is made from a light microfiber material, uses compatible mobile devices (such as the Pixel Phone) as the screen and features a small, lightweight motion controller. The device is lined with cloth, compared to other VR devices which are primarily made of plastic, in the hopes to provide a more comfortable and affordable experience for the user at the expense of graphical fidelity. The device costs $79 and will be available in November. Several minor products were also announced, including a multipoint router produced by Google. Named Google Wi-Fi, the puck shaped routers allow consistent and fast internet access, along with the ability to see which devices are connected and the option to block said devices. The routers are available individually for $129 or in a three pack for $299. They will be available for U.S. customers to pre-order in November and will ship in December. There was also the announcement of the Chromecast Ultra, an upgrade to the company’s existing streaming device. The upgrade adds 4K streaming options and an ethernet port, which the original Chromecast lacked. The product will be available in November with a price of $69. Google also shed more light on the Google Home, its voice-activated home smart device, similar to the Amazon Echo. The device features a mute button (for those who like they’re privacy) and an audio version of Google Now, named Google Assistant. Just like Amazon Echo, Google Home can be used to browse the internet or control compatible devices with spoken voice commands. The product will ship on Nov. 4 and costs $129.  Whether these products can match the success of recent Apple products in terms of sale remains to be seen.

X Google hands over data on three Irish users to law authorities Transparency report reveals 62 accounts or users targeted here in first six months Mon, Oct 17, 2016, 05:05 Elaine Edwards French police detain a man outside the Bataclan Theatre in Paris on November 13th, 2015. Immediately following the terrorist attacks, which killed 130 people, French law enforcement authorities made 4,286 requests to Google in relation to 5,164 users or accounts. Photograph: EPA/Yoan Valat         Google received 19 requests for information regarding 62 customers or accounts from Irish authorities in the first six months of this year. Publishing its Google Transparency report, the company revealed it handed over information about three users or accounts on foot of requests from law enforcement. In the second half of 2015, however, the company disclosed information about 5,209 users, or 43 per cent of 12,113 customers targeted in just 14 law enforcement requests. Companies such as Google are only permitted to disclose limited data on law enforcement requests. So it is unclear why such a large number of users were targeted by Irish authorities in 2015, or whether those requests came from gardaí or another body. It is also unclear whether the requests relate to emails or other content, or to communications metadata. For comparison, the UK made 3,044 requests in relation to 3,696 users or accounts in the first six months; Google handed over information in 69 per cent of the cases. In the first six months of the year, a period immediately following last November’s terrorist attacks in Paris, French law enforcement authorities made 4,286 requests in relation to 5,164 users or accounts. Google handed over information in 60 per cent of the cases. Regular requests Google said that, like other technology and communications companies, it regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to hand over user data. “We review each request to make sure that it complies with both the spirit and the letter of the law,” the company said, “and we may refuse to produce information or try to narrow the request in some cases.” Globally, Google received 44,943 government requests for information regarding 76,713 accounts between January and June 2016. It provided user information in response to 64 per cent of them. ADVERTISEMENT Google said it received its first ever requests this year from Algeria, Belarus, Cayman Islands, El Salvador, Fiji and Saudi Arabia.       Topics: Google Read More Google: EU’s data protection authorities have “absolute focus” on privacy Ryanair challenges Google on ad transparency Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Agribusiness & Food Noonan heads to the US to drum up some business Work Lucy Kellaway: I don’t want my employers to feel my pain International Ken Early: When the going gets tough, Ireland get going Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa Power up your company's pension plan Designed for life: Helen James on creativity and a life InSync ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Nearly 70% of rural SMEs hobbled by poor internet 06:01 Knock airport summer passenger numbers climb 10% to 360,000 05:59 Lucy Kellaway: I don’t want my employers to feel my pain 05:54 What does Brexit mean for Irish manufacturers’ domestic sales? 05:50 Hotel planning bid lodged for Adelaide Road corner site 05:50 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

The first day of a long awaited mission to retake Mosul from the Islamic State (Isis) ended with Iraqi forces “ahead of schedule”, according to the Pentagon. “By midday they had achieved roughly what they had intended to do,” spokesman Peter Cook said. “It’s day one, it’s early, but this had kicked off certainly the way the Iraqis had hoped.” Starting at about 6am Baghdad time, about 30,000 coalition forces advanced on Mosul: Iraqi troops from the south, Kurdish peshmerga from the east and US air strikes and ground special forces supporting both. Some 6,000 jihadi militants, some who set oil and tire fires to hide their positions in smoke, are believed to be in the city. By 10pm local time, Kurdish president Massoud Barzani said the peshmerga had taken approximately 80 miles (200km) of territory from Isis, and commanders said they had cleared nine villages. Isis militants laid IEDs throughout the towns and sent a series of suicide attacks on Kurdish and Iraqi forces, slowing the march. Near Mosul, the Guardian’s Martin Chulov saw a fighter jet “engaged in a kind of cat and mouse game with a very active Isis mortar team”, and throughout the day Isis fought Iraqi and Kurdish forces with small arms and artillery. The Pentagon said about 5,000 American military personnel are in Iraq, and that special forces are advising Iraqi and Kurdish units and guiding strikes, some near the outskirts of the city. “We are crystal clear that Americans are in harm’s way in Iraq, but they are not in a lead role,” Cook said. One resident told the Guardian that Isis militants are trying to hide among civilians, storing IEDs in family homes, and are riding through the city on motorcycles to evade airstrikes. “People have had enough in Mosul,” he said. “We have seen too many beheadings, people being drowned in cafes, thrown from buildings.” Mosul About a million civilians are believed to remain in Mosul, and hundreds of thousands of children are thought to be in danger. The United Nations and aid groups fear a humanitarian crisis of as many as 700,000 people. The groups have set up refugee camps, able to hold about 60,000 people, in nearby Kurdish-held territory. Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi addressed the nation early Monday, telling residents in Mosul: “These forces that are liberating you today, they have one goal in Mosul, which is to get rid of Daesh and to secure your dignity. They are there for your sake.” The coalition against Isis intends to drop seven million leaflets in 48 hours over the city, which Cook said would either warn civilians how to flee or have “some specific guidance as to the safest place to be in your homes, if there’s air strikes or artillery or if the fight comes to be in your neighborhood.” Residents and Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister warned against allowing Shia militias join the fight against Isis, for fears of the sectarian violence that so traumatized Iraq in the civil war of the 2000s. Mosul’s post-Isis fate is also uncertain: it could become a humanitarian crisis, and the city has significance to Kurds and Sunni and Shia Arabs. If the Mosul offensive is a success, what could this mean for Isis?

The film was taken at some distance, but the ensuing explosion is massive enough to veil nearby vehicles in clouds of dust and sand.

Minutes later, a large mortar thumped into the soil next to an armoured truck less than 40 metres away. Then came a second shell, which nearly scored a direct hit on a still-working digger. The Isis mortar team had maintained its range and rhythm, despite the Kurdish attacks. Analysis Five key questions about the battle for MosulIraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces have begun a ground assault to oust Islamic State from Iraq’s second biggest cityRead more Back up the mountain, another smoke fire had been lit in an area that seemed to be behind Kurdish positions. The fire came from a cluster of homes set against Bashika mountain, which the Kurds had bypassed as they pushed ahead. Two more mortars, which had to have come from the same area, crunched into the peshmerga command post, one damaging a home and the other nearly killing a group of men walking just below. Further along the road to Erbil, a large empty refugee camp stood in the dust waiting to receive inhabitants that are yet to arrive. Aid agencies guess that more than 1 million people will attempt to flee Mosul and its surrounds as the offensive pushes closer. For now though, those who are able to leave are making long, difficult journeys to another camp, Dibaga. There, one man who arrived from Mosul on Sunday said the terror group was becoming ever more ruthless as pressure mounted on its last urban redoubt in Iraq.

Photograph: Cengiz Yar “Isis became terrible with the residents lately,” said the man, 28, who claimed to have been part of a nascent resistance unit along with his brother, uncle and father. “Their situation is awful and they have started to flee. We haven’t seen many of them in the street lately, even at the checkpoints. There is no security. We’ve been arrested by them. They said we were (Mosul resistance). They knew we were planning to leave and they came to my house. We decided to run, because they were going to kill us. We all left at night, all the women too. We went to another house and then we left the city through a farm. “You see them most at night. That’s when they leave their bases to make checkpoints and ask for identification. They’re mostly from Mosul. The foreigners left a while ago. I don’t know where they went. They have made a lot of trenches around the city. That’s all they can do. Burn things and run.” Fighting for every yard: on the ground with Kurdish troops pushing into Mosul Read more Updated at 4.21pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.39pm EDT 15:39 Mosul resident: Isis trying to hide with civilians A 35-year-old Mosul resident, using the pseudonym Abu Mohammed, has told Fazel Hawramy, reporting for the Guardian, that Isis forces are trying to mix into the population, and that civilians have seen “too many beheadings, people being drowned in cafes, thrown from buildings”. Everyone is staying at home because we don’t know what else to do. Daesh [an Arabic acronym for Isis] are mostly moving around on motorbike and have small and heavy guns. The planes started bombing Mosul around one in the morning today, and they are in the sky constantly and occasionally striking targets. I would say the airstrikes are very precise but around 10% of casualties, in my estimate, are civilians. Daesh are moving into civilian houses and mixing with the population. For example Daesh has placed a large depot of IEDs in a house next to my cousin’s. I begged him to leave his house and bring his family to stay with me, as the house could be targeted by coalition. He refused and said [he accepts] whatever destiny brings. People have had enough in Mosul. The majority want Daesh to go as soon as possible and would like to see the Iraqi army and peshmerga to enter the city. We have seen too many beheadings, people being drowned in cafes, thrown from buildings, etc. People have even offered to sacrifice animals if they see Daesh [go[ and get rid of them. I myself saw a man thrown off a building near the governor’s office around three months ago. I could not sleep for a week afterwards. It’s difficult for civilians to leave the city because a ditch has been dug around many neighborhoods, especially east of the city. There is also fighting – we cannot leave our houses. Smoke rises from clashes in the east of Mosul.

Barzani called the gains a “turning point in the war against terrorism,” but warned defeating Isis in the city would not mean the end of sectarian violence or terrorism in Iraq. He added that Kurdish forces will not enter the city itself, and declined to say who would govern territory seized by the Peshmerga. In the past, Kurdish officials have said all territory retaken by the peshmerga will be incorporated into the largely autonomous Kurdish region. The general command of peshmerga forces also released a statement, saying that as of 10pm local time, their troops “had achieved their key objectives: clear nine villages and extend control over the Erbil-Mosul road.” In less than 24 hours nine villages were cleared in an area measuring approximately 200 square kilometres. The villages include Baskhira, Tarjala, Kharbat Sultan, Karbirli, Bazgirtan, Shaquli, Badana Bchuk, Badana Gawre, Shekh Amir and a tile factory West of Hasan Shami. Peshmerga forces also secured an additional significant stretch of the Erbil-Mosul road. The operations in east and south Mosul are in coordination with Iraqi Security Forces in a shared effort to clear Isil from Ninevah province. Global coalition warplanes attacked 17 Isis positions in support of Peshmerga forces. At least four Isis VBIEDs were destroyed. Counter-IED teams will continue to clear the heavily-mined area. The region’s prime minister, Nechirvan Barzani, also released a statement, calling the campaign “an important event for the entire world since Isis used the city as a launching pad for attacks”. He praised peshmerga troops’ “resilience and heroism against the most dangerous terrorist organization in the world”, and said the Kurds are “proud to protect all different ethnic and religious groups in the region”.

The displacement could become the single largest, most complex humanitarian operation in the world, the AP reports. “Our capacity to support 700,000 people in the short-term we couldn’t do it. And certainly if we had to mount a response over the intermediate-term, if they couldn’t go back to Mosul quickly, if there was too much damage in the city, then it would test us to breaking point,” Grande said. The news agency has also spoke with Iraq’s commander of the joint military operation, army lieutenant general Talib Shaghati, who said the campaign “is going very well”. Shaghati declined to give details in the interview, which took place in the town of Khazer, but said troops were moving according to plan. He praised the role of the U.S.-led International Coalition as “very important” through carrying out airstrikes and sharing intelligence. Citing intelligence information, he claimed some IS militants were fleeing Mosul to Syria along with their families.

The instructions are meant to “make [residents] as aware as possible of the dangers they face, and they’re not insignificant, of course,” Cook says. A reporter asks about the spat between Ankara and Baghdad over the presence of Turkish forces in Iraq to fight Isis. “Our advice to the Iraqis as to the Turks is to sit down and discuss” their disagreements, Cook says. “Forces operating in Iraq, international forces, need to be there at the consent of the Iraqi government.” He says it’s at the discretion of al-Abadi’s government to decide whether other groups, such as Shia militias – who with Sunni militias sowed chaos during Iraq’s brutal, post-invasion civil war – will take part in the fight. A Mosul city councilman told the Guardian earlier on Monday that he and his colleagues had urged al-Abadi not to let Shia militias join the fight for fear of sectarian violence. With that, the briefing concludes. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.20pm EDT 14:20 Cook calls the assessment of Mosul over the last two years as “pretty abysmal” under Isis, and that although the coalition is worried about the humanitarian situation, “the goal first of all is to remove Isil”. He says the coalition plans to drop 7 million leaflets in Mosul over the next 48 hours to try to educate the residents of the city on how to stay safe or, if possible, escape Mosul. “Certainly there has been resistance from Isil,” Cook says, alluding to footage of artillery, small arms combat and explosions circulating online. “This is a big fight with multiple locations so fighting may be more intense in some locations than others.” A reporter asks about the simultaneous campaign in Syria, and Cook says the Pentagon is optimistic: “We think Isil is on the run, both in Syria and Iraq, and that’s a good thing.” Another asks whether the US intends to send special forces on the ground to assist Turkish troops who have had recent successes in Syria. “You know me better,” Cook replies, “than for me to tell you where US special forces are going anywhere in the world.” My colleague Julian Borger, who is at the briefing, asks about the leaflets being dropped for the residents of Mosul. “These leaflets make clear that help is on the way,” Cook says. “There may be some specific guidance as to the safest place to be in your homes if there’s airstrikes or artillery or if the fight comes to be in your neighbourhood.” He says that in certain parts of the city residents are being warned to stay in their homes, “because they may be safer in that context than trying to flee the city.” Updated at 3.28pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.09pm EDT 14:09 “Most American forces are not anywhere close to the frontline,” Cook says, but he concedes that many remain in danger near Mosul and elsewhere in Iraq. “We are crystal clear that Americans are in harm’s way in Iraq, but they are not in a lead role.” The Pentagon spokesman says Isis has had two years to prepare for this campaign by setting traps in and around Mosul, “to plant IEDs to do what they can to make life more difficult for the Iraqi security forces, certainly to make life more difficult for the people of Mosul.” He calls Isis “an enemy with a substantial ability to make life much more difficult”. Cook is again asked about Iraqi progress in the campaign. “This is the biggest military operation we’ve had in Iraq by the Iraqi forces,” Cook says. “Plenty of Americans have contributed to getting Iraqi forces into this position. “By midday they had achieved roughly what they had intended to do. It’s day one, it’s early, but this had kicked off certainly the way the Iraqis had hoped,” he says. “Day one, so far, has gone according to plan.” He is asked whether there is an indication that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of Isis, might be in Mosul. “I don’t have any information at this time,” Cook says. Mosul latest Updated at 3.01pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.00pm EDT 14:00 “There are Americans on the outskirts of the city,” Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook tells reporters, “but I’m not going to get into the disposition of every single American”. He declines to get into any specifics about the movements or positions of various forces. “I can’t speak to the movement of every single Iraqi brigade or every single American.” “There was a plan for Americans to provide that advisory role as they have through the course of this,” he says. “It is too soon to say at this point where these movements will go, where these Americans will go in this advisory capacity. “But what is important is that it will be the Iraqis in the lead.” He says Americans “are behind the forward line of troops, and they are providing the same sort of advice and assistance in Iraq as they were previously”. Cook is asked about the plan for if and when Isis militants are ousted from Mosul, but declines to get into specifics. “We do have concerns about the humanitarian situation,” and he says simply that the US has been coordinating with Baghdad and the UN.

Google Camera v4.2 is found out of the box on the Pixel, and thanks to developers on XDA, a modified version of that new version is available for anyone using a Nexus 5X or Nexus 6P. This version of the app is available to sideload, but doesn’t install over your current Google Camera application since it has been modified by developers. The app is supposed to work on any device with Android Nougat, but seems to only work on the Nexus 5X and 6P so far. Other users are reporting errors on other Nexus smartphones such as the Nexus 6. The first notable addition is shooting grids. Alongside HDR and flash toggles you’ll find an option to activate a grid. Three options are available including 3×3, 4×4, and the Golden Ratio grid. While this isn’t a big change, it is pretty useful. More important, Google Camera v4.2 adds auto-focus lock and exposure control. To access these option, long press on the area you want to lock focus, then adjust the exposure with the slider along the side of the display. Many users, myself included, are also reporting faster speeds with this app compared to previous versions. Aside from the previously noted changes, there are some new animations and options in the settings menu. If you’re interested in downloading the app, head over to XDA to grab the APK!

Reliable facts have become an endangered species in an era of adversarial politics and media bias. Google News already uses labels like "Most referenced", "In-Depth" and "Highly Cited" to help readers find reliable news sources, but now it's adding "Fact Check" to the mix in an effort to highlight articles which try to avoid blindly regurgitating the lies of public figures. Just the facts ma'am: Google aims to highlight news articles which strive for accuracy and weed out political half-truths Photo: Alex Elllinghausen Google News isn't manually fact-checking articles, instead it's giving news sites the option to include ClaimReview tags in their articles to indicate that facts have been checked. This is obviously open to abuse, although Google says if a site uses the ClaimReview tags but does not follow the criteria the search giant may ignore the tags or even banish the site from Google News. The fact-checking criteria includes; Discrete claims and checks must be easily identified in the body of fact-check articles. Readers should be able to understand what was checked, and what conclusions were reached. Analysis must be transparent about sources and methods, with citations and references to primary sources. The organisation must be non-partisan, with transparent funding and affiliations. It should examine a range of claims in its topic area, instead of targeting a single person or entity. Article titles must indicate that a claim is being reviewed, state the conclusions reached, or simply frame that the article's contents consist of fact checking. Google News' Fact Check label is coming to the United States and United Kingdom first, in time for the US presidential election battle between Trump and Clinton, and it's likely to expand to Australia where politicians also struggle to differentiate fact from fiction. You'd think efforts to strive for accuracy would have bipartisan support, but in some circles any kind of fact-checking is considered a form of political attack – strangely enough people who twist the facts don't like being called out on it. Advertisement While fact checking is designed to weed out deliberate untruths, both by public figures and the reporters who write about them, it's obviously harder to crack down on bias where the truth is used selectively or one point of view is suppressed. Bias is also in the eye of the beholder – these days the definition of bias tends to be anyone who doesn't agree with you or has the audacity to point out an inconvenient fact. There's also the challenge that a growing number of news items are actually comment/opinion pieces, which by their very nature contain a certain level of bias, but it's still possible to check the facts on which those opinions are supposedly based. Practically every media outlet is considered biased by some part of the political spectrum, so it will be interesting to see whether Google's Fact Check helps to curb bias or whether it's simply labelled another form of bias. How do you assess the trustworthiness of a news article? Would you put your faith in Google's Fact Check label? Advertisement 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

That’s why our list of Android Phones with the Best Battery Life is so popular. With the Google Pixel phone shipping in just a few days, one big question on everyone’s mind is how long it will last. It seems one Reddit user got their hands on the device before launch and spilled their guts after a weekend rendezvous with Google’s Nexus-killer. Here are his battery stats after a full-day of use: Those are some pretty amazing stats! What’s comforting – assuming this is a legit test on an actual Pixel – is that it was done in a real-life scenario where all the device’s capabilities were enjoyed including the camera, navigation, flight mode, phone, and WiFi. As you can see, top battery hogs include the screen, the OS, Waze, Android System, Google Services, and Phone idle. They were mostly connected to mobile data except for what appears to be 2 flights including a layover after which it seems they probably flipped on their GPS to navigate around their new locale. The user mentioned the above activity was logged from 9AM to 10:30PM without charging. That’s 12 hours of real-world use with 40% battery life left, estimated to provide them with an additional 8 hours of juice, meaning it’s likely the Google Pixel can easily last a full day with 20+ hours of battery life. Some additional screenshots provided by the Redditor reveal a bit more: Here we can see the user achieved 3+ hours of screen on time and had 10+ minutes of voice calls. We think that’s very impressive and a selection of comments on the Reddit post reflect similar sentiments, let us know if you agree. Also included are CPU and Phone Signal history over a two and a half day period. In terms of fast-charging it seems the Pixel performs as advertised, with the OP claiming that the included USB-C wall charger is fast, especially when powering through the 20% to 85% charge range. We’re incredibly excited to see this early report suggesting the Google Pixel gets impressive battery life, but we’ve also learned to be cautious about early reports and rumors. Battery life tends to outperform expectations on brand new phones, dragging a bit soon thereafter, so we’ll see how the Pixel holds up when people download their entire repertoire of apps and games. local_offer    battery life   Pixel   Pixel XL   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (140) stars Further Reading The Verizon Pixel XL is delayed again Pixel & Pixel XL feature magnet for flip cases Pixel mod allows for stereo speaker sound [ROOT] Pixel adoption beating Nexus Quite Black 32GB Pixel & Pixel XL back in stock stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Fill out our form or use #AskAnSEO on social media. Yet again, we’ve had a visitor ask a question that just can’t be answered in one paragraph, nor even one post. But I hope that this long treatment of the question will help clarify when you should and should not use nofollow on links. What are the advantages and disadvantages of nofollow link? I think to answer this question; you have to understand a little bit of the history around the nofollow attribute. Google decided a few years ago that people were abusing links since they had made public that they were a part of the Google algorithm. Google singlehandedly decided to create this attribute. The idea was, you could use this attribute to signal to Google that you didn’t want them to count this link when they were evaluating your site’s inbound links. It was originally meant to be used for paid links, where you had control over the inbound link. Then Google started penalizing people for having too many links pointing to them that were deemed “unnatural”, such as directories, link exchanges, press releases, guest posts… it seems like every time you turn around now; there’s another link type you’re “supposed” to make nofollow. What all this madness ignores is that links are the fundamental building blocks of the World Wide Web – born 25 years ago this year, in fact. Before search engines, the number one way people found new sites was by following links. But because the number one place most people start on the web now is a search engine (although it’s rapidly being overtaken by social and apps), Google feels perfectly at ease with dictating how we should link to each other. As you can probably tell, I’m not a fan of this. I believe interactions should be natural; that sites that provide high-quality experiences and traffic should be able to link to anyone any way that they please. If your site doesn’t do these things, then you have other problems beyond what type of link attributes to use. But I haven’t answered the question. Nofollow links do not pass PageRank. Therefore, using a nofollow link means that link won’t pass PageRank (a Google-only measurement of the quantity and quality of links) to another page. This means, on the one hand, that Google cannot penalize you for linking to a site that’s known to be a low-quality site. They also can’t penalize you for linking out too much (yes, that’s actually happened). On the other hand, this also means that a link from your site bears no value to other sites, which means they’re much less likely to include you in announcements of new products or exciting developments unless you already have a very large user base. Many of the largest sites like CNN and NFL now place nofollow on ALL their outbound links. This means that a link on their site has no value regarding PageRank. However, they still have value – very high value – because of the quality and size of their user base. Never forget, even a nofollow link has value, because it gives potential visitors the opportunity to visit your site and expands awareness. Even a mention on a site without a link is valuable for raising awareness. All this sounds confusing because it is. There are no hard and fast rules to apply when deciding whether to link out to sites or not. However, I can provide you with a few good guidelines: Always nofollow links in comments or on forums. Anything that has user-generated content is likely to be a source of spam – even if you carefully moderate, things will slip through. I’ve fought back more than one manual action for UGC (User Generated Content) spam on some very reputable forums my clients’ manage. It slips through, even if you nofollow. But if you don’t nofollow, your spam-fighting will be much harder and more prevalent. Always nofollow links that are meant to be advertisements or are in a sponsorship arrangement. This means sponsored content, text and image advertising, and run-of-site links. Always nofollow links in press releases. They’ve just been over-used and abused too much. Most press release sites now nofollow all links by default anyway. If you charge in any way for a link (directory submission, quality assessment, reviews, etc.), nofollow the outbound links.   The difficulty comes in evaluating editorial links. Allow Followed Links in These Cases: Bylines of authors for guest posters. This is only valid if your guest poster is someone you have vetted, who posts often on your site, and whose site is one that you trust. Even then, only allow your authors to include a single link, and only allow their anchor text to be their own name or their company name. The reason for doing this is that many reputable authors will prefer to post on sites that will offer them a link back to their company site in exchange for great content. Links to interviewees. If you are interviewing a celebrity or a subject matter expert, I think it’s fine to link to that person’s site. Again, only use anchor text (the linkable text) of their name or their company name to be safe, but providing a link in exchange for their time is the least you can do, and will help you score interviews with other important people in the future. But be careful if you interview people every week, if you interview a lot of people who no one’s ever heard of, or if you interview someone who is known to practice shady link practices on their own site. Any of those situations might be one where you should nofollow the link. Links in editorial content. If you are providing an unbiased, uncompensated review of a product or a tool, go ahead and link to that site. If you are citing another article as a source, link to that article. If you mention a positive association that you have with another site, go ahead and link to it. These are legitimate, editorial links. These sites deserve that link that you’re providing them. But be careful if you write a lot of review posts, if you receive something for free in exchange for reviewing it, or if you write a post only about one product or service without comparing it to others. These are all red flags for Google and they may begin to view your posts as “sponsored” content. This is Not an Exhaustive List Duane Forrester, formerly of Bing, once said that the only true link is the one you didn’t know you were going to get. While I think that’s somewhat naïve considering the many different types of link arrangements out there, I think it’s a good guideline for publishers. If you’re writing an article and the site you link to didn’t know you were going to mention them in advance, it’s probably just fine to keep that link follow-able. I think it’s also fine if you decide to mention someone and you say to them ahead of time, “Hey, mind if I mention your idea in my article? I’ll give you credit.” You’ll see I’ve provided a link to Duane’s personal blog above. Since he’s no longer with Bing, it doesn’t make sense to link to them, but I want to give Duane credit. I don’t get to choose if SEJ allows it to be follow-able or not, but if I were writing this on my blog, it would be. I’m sure this has made when to use nofollow (and when not to) about as clear as mud. My best advice for choosing is to be as natural as possible. If you want to link to the site and feel no pressure or obligation to do so, go ahead. If you’re getting money in exchange or you don’t think the site deserves the follow-able link, make it nofollow.

Google Photos begins creating animations from videos, gets smarter about fixing sideways pictures You may start seeing more frequent memories to help you capture all those small moments of a young child growing up. Derek Walter on 15 October, 2016 03:39 0 - - - - print email Google is flexing more of its AI muscles in Google Photos, promising to do much of the work for you when it comes to fixing images, finding memories, or making cute animations you’ll want to share with friends and family. In the latest Google Photos update, the app will begin to ping you about pictures that are sideways but need an adjustment. You’ll then be able to fix them all at once. The Keyword Google Photos will pull together images that it thinks you ought to rotate. Additionally, Google Photos will now pull moments out of your videos and then turn them into an animation. Unfortunately, you can’t select any segments from your videos to do this yourself. That is still controlled by the artificial intelligence overlords. The Keyword Google Photos will create short animations out of your video clips. Google also says you’ll be pinged more regularly with recent photo highlights. This may have special appeal to those with young children, who can get frequent updates about all of those moments that can fly by pretty quickly. The Keyword Watch that little one grow up with regular updates from Google Photos. All of the new stuff is coming to the Android, iOS, and web version of Google Photos. The impact on you: Google Photos continues to show why it’s an excellent option for saving all of your pictures. The machine learning makes it easier to find past images and to do some basic sorting. However, some more human-powered editing would be helpful in this case, such as the ability to pull out animations from the videos on your own.

Derek Walter 15 October, 2016 05:55 - - - - print email Comments Google is just getting started when it comes to selling its own hardware. Another rumor from the usually accurate Evan Blass points to a pair of Google-built watches that will come early next year. Google’s two smartwatches will be released with Android Wear 2.0 in Q1 2017 [image courtesy of: https://t.co/so8uJyEZCy] pic.twitter.com/ruejqXSNSy — Evan Blass (@evleaks) October 13, 2016 We’ve heard this before, but we have a lot more context now after attending the ”Made by Google” hardware event, where the company showed off the Pixel, DayDream View headset, Chromecast Ultra, Google WiFi, and Google Home. Something new to wear The tenor of the gathering and the new shift by Google told us this wasn’t a one-off event. Google has installed Rick Osterloh, the former head of Motorola's mobile division, as the new senior vice president of hardware. There’s a dedicated Made by Google site that shows off all the gear, further solidifying that hardware will be a major part of Google’s strategy going forward. Nearly every speaker at the event talked about how Google services and the company’s desire to build a “personal Google” for every user require a deep integration between hardware and software. Google Google dropped a ton of hardware at its Oct. 4 event. Given all of this, a watch makes perfect sense, particularly if it’s high-end and offers that deep software integration we heard so much about. Android Wear has a lot of catching up to do with the Apple Watch. For Google to really compete, it ought to build a watch that targets the same type of features that Apple is banking on to drive customers to the Series 2 watch: a much brighter screen, GPS tracking, and waterproofing. Those, combined with a lot of software innovation related to fitness tracking, make the Apple Watch an ideal companion for the health-conscious. Other watchmakers have hit the pause button this year, likely given the delay in Android Wear 2.0. It looks like a reboot of sorts is wisely on the way. A new tablet? There were rumors earlier this year that a Huawei-built tablet was coming. But it was nowhere to be found at the “Made by Google” event. And the rumor mill has gone dark. It’s all rather odd. Google desperately needs a new, Googley tablet that isn’t quite as thick or heavy as the Pixel C. There aren’t a ton of compelling Android tablets out there. Plus, a new Pixel tablet would give Google the chance to get the new Google Assistant out into more hands and further drive people into its new hardware ecosystem. It’s certainly one of the rumors that we’ll want to watch as 2016 wraps up and we turn towards the new year.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach A Telstra customer received his pre-ordered Google Pixel smartphone ahead of the Oct. 20 launch date and shared snaps and review of the latest Android phone on social media. Why can I remember song lyrics from 1999 but not things like omg when&#39;s my flight #ThingsICantRemember. Saved by #GoogleAssistant #Pixel pic.twitter.com/WvRemCCTs0 &mdash; Made by Google (@madebygoogle) October 13, 2016 Unveiled Oct. 4 in San Francisco, California, Google Pixel costs $1,079 for the 32GB model or $1,229 for the 128GB model in Australia. Meanwhile, the Google Pixel XL sets back customers $1,269 for the 32GB model or $1,419 for the 128GB handset. Google Pixel review According to the unnamed customer’s experience, the Google Pixel can last for a day’s use without charging. “It's not a 100 percent to 5 percent as I can't really risk running out of battery when I'm travelling around another state, but the stats below are a days use - 0900 to 2230 without charging. “Battery - a days use is easily feasible. I haven't had any concerns.” A previous Google Nexus 5 user, the customer is not completely impressed with the features of his new smartphone. “I guess the ultimate question is, if I could go round again, knowing what the phone is like, would I buy it again? I can only speak from a user coming from the N5 which ran out of update life with Nougat 7.0 and so I'd say, yes I would buy it again. However, if I had a newer Nexus or had to pay the outright cost ($1000+ in Australia for the 32gb) I honestly would not be happy in the phone.” “It's a nice phone, well built with some design issues. (It has) a solid sunny day camera but a lack of features for the price makes it difficult to recommend to anyone with a phone newer than 2014.” Google Pixel 32gb - I'm back, as promised, with some battery stats and weekend use report from Android Both Google Pixel and Pixel XL run on 4GB RAM, Android 7.1 Nougat interface and Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor. Both handsets feature 12 megapixel rear camera and 8 megapixel front camera. However, the Google Pixel model has a smaller 5-inch screen and 2770mAh battery, unlike Google Pixel XL’s 5.5-inch screen size and 3450mAh battery.

Vision: Google facebook twitter pinterest linkedin email print A new tech-savvy mirror dishes out beauty advice and can even deliver the goods to remedy what it deems to be “imperfections”.  The current model, from Panasonic, isn’t on the market yet, but at a Japanese electronics trade show, CEATEC, it demonstrated how it can detect blemishes, spots, large pores, wrinkles and sun damage on the face. After these have been detected, the mirror can recommend beauty treatments, such as exfoliation or facial serums. Are you ready to be told how to be the fairest of them all? Photo: Panasonic. It also offers make-up suggestions and allows the user try out different looks. If it is connected to a 3D printer, the mirror can then print out delicate patches of make-up specifically designed to cover the “problem areas”.  As the technology is still in development stages, these make-up patches require one day to dry and “settle” before being applied to the face.  Panasonic hopes this technology will eventually be able to be used to cover scars or birthmarks.  The mirror detect blemishes, spots, large pores, wrinkles and sun damage on the face.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out business Search Industries Small Business Money Farming World Better Business Nurture Change 2016 Opinion & Analysis Tools Google's nit-picky interview process is turning great coders away JULIE BORT Last updated 12:09, October 17 2016 DADO RUVIC/REUTERS Some programmers believe the company has designed its tough recruitment process to favour recent graduates. By just about any measure, Google is one of the best companies a software programmer can work for, between its high pay, free food, playground of a campus, and the interesting tech it creates. But in one important way, the company may have shot itself in the foot: its legendarily difficult interview process. Google is right now being sued on allegations of age discrimination by a couple of job candidates who didn't get offered a job there. Google is fighting the suit and calls the allegations "without merit". The suit may very well be without merit, but some programmers believe the company has designed its tough recruitment process to heavily favour those fresh from school with less real-world experience. READ MORE: Google still struggling to hire more than Asian or white men In fact, that notorious interview process caused freelance programmer Michael Geary simply not to apply for a full-time job at Google even after he had worked as a contract programmer for the company for five years, he told Business Insider. Google knows he's a Google Maps expert Back in late 2007, Geary had been working at a startup called Zvents, a company which created local event calendars (it was later acquired by StubHub). His job was to build maps to events, so he had become an expert with programming using Google Maps. As a friendly, helpful fellow, he spent a lot of time on the Google Maps mailing list helping other programmers with their questions. Ad Feedback Google took notice and hired him to help it build an election map for the 2008 presidential election. Although he lives near the Googleplex in Mountain View, he was attached to a team working in Washington, DC. They liked his work and he enjoyed working with them, so he continued on a contract basis for another five years. At that point, Google pulled the project in-house. He faced a choice: apply to join Google, either with this team or another, or move on to another contract job. He opted to move on. "I heard about this interview process," Geary said, "It seemed fine-tuned for people just out of college. When you are just out college, there's a lot of algorithms, and data structures and fast-thinking on a whiteboard, like you do in school. As opposed to real software engineering, there's a lot of other stuff that goes into that. "In my real work, in 20 years, I've never used a whiteboard. I use my computer. But in job interviews they do it all the time." He said he feared the process would be "quizzes about algorithmic minutiae and having to code a red-black tree on the spot on a whiteboard — all things that favour recent CS grads." He's not alone in this attitude Earlier this week, a blog post went viral on Hacker News, a site where programmers chat about news of interest to them, from Pierre Gauthier, a man with 37 years of coding experience and 24 years of R&D director experience. Gauthier, founder and CEO of TWD Industries, wrote that he never applied to Google but was called and asked to apply for a director of engineering job. So he agreed to a phone interview. He posted the questions he was asked in the interview and the recruiter's reply, coupled with his inner monologue about it all. Basically, the recruiter was asking a list of technical questions and believed that there was only one "right" answer, he said. According to the blog post: "Google's representative stated that both management and up-to-date coding skills were required (a rare mix). But having exercised the former for more than 2 decades and the latter for almost 4 decades was not enough: I failed to give the 'right answers.'" His inner monologue basically shredded the recruiter's "right" answer to pieces, pointing out other technical solutions that were better. But perhaps the most famous story is how Google rejected a programmer named Max Howell in 2015. Howell is well known for creating a popular programming tool called Homebrew. Howell vented his frustration in a tweet that went viral. The tweet said, "Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can't invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off." He later explained in another tweet, "I was rejected this morning. But it was a flippant tweet." Howell told Business Insider, "For me the situation was: Google really needed a plumber, so I turned up with 20 years of experience and all the right tools (some of which I'd developed myself), but then they insisted on quizzing me on fluid dynamics before they'd let me fix their leak." HAPPY ENDINGS Ironically, after Geary talked about not applying in a post on Hacker News last week, a product manager for the mapping team replied and told him that he did want to hire him and tried to get Google to fund the position, but got turned down. Geary says that not applying to Google back then, "could have been a mistake on my part," although he still has no intention of applying now. Meanwhile, Max Howell landed at Apple. And Gauthier updated his blog post to say that after the post went viral, he received an outpouring of job offers (that he didn't need) and resumes of people wanting to come work for him, telling us, "Google cold-called me – I was not seeking a job. I founded TWD 18 years ago," he said, telling us he believes his company's "'post-quantum' security technology is way ahead of today's academic R&D." When we asked Google to respond to criticism that its interview process favours new college grads, a spokesperson told us: "From hundreds of thousands of interviews, we hire thousands of engineers every year — from new college grads to people with decades of experience. "The process is well known to be rigorous, but we get consistently positive feedback from interviewees. Of course, with that many interviews taking place, there are some candidates who come away unhappy. We want more great people from a range of backgrounds and ages to apply to work here, so are very grateful for their feedback." - This story was first published on BusinessInsider.com.au  - BusinessInsider.com.au Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next World story: Why I walked away from my $4 million job Business Homepage Comments business headlines Hundreds of EQC claims Milk down the drain, on paddocks Wellington CBD to reopen Tuesday Property 'cheaper in 12 months' Sister city celebrations cancelled Supermarkets reopening after quake Stock up on groceries Harvey Norman billionaire fires up 'Weapons conference' protests planned Woodlyn Park for sale, again Damage minor to Kiwi's Wellington buildings Falling air-con unit cut 111 service Field trip leads winner to land More pressure on builders Home office most business' contingency plan Ad Feedback Most popular Viewed Shared Commented Live: 7.5 New Zealand quake causes casualties, tsunamis, and destruction Earthquake: Deaths, major damage after severe 7.5 quake hits Hanmer Springs, tsunami warning issued Photos: Large quake strikes New Zealand Earthquake: Tsunamis hit, warnings downgraded NZ Quake: What you need to know Ghost city: Wellington residents abandon central city after 7.5 earthquake Earthquake: Scenes of chaos and destruction around New Zealand Elms Homestead earthquake victim a 'quiet, private man' Earthquake: Two dead in 7.5-magnitude quake Earthquake: Passengers finally off Interislander ferry after huge quake stopped it docking Live: 7.5 New Zealand quake causes casualties, tsunamis, and destruction Photos: Large quake strikes New Zealand Earthquake: Deaths, major damage after severe 7.5 quake hits Hanmer Springs, tsunami warning issued Ghost city: Wellington residents abandon central city after 7.5 earthquake Earthquake: Passengers finally off Interislander ferry after huge quake stopped it docking Earthquake: Isolated South Island towns damaged, cut off NZ Quake: What you need to know 'Wall of water' as quake dam bursts on Clarence River Earthquake: The quake swarm that followed the big one Earthquake: there's no evidence the moon causes quakes special offers Ad Feedback National World Business Technology Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Stuff.co.nz About Us | Contact Us | View Mobile Site Subscribe Text | Follow us on Facebook and Twitter | Newspapers | Magazine subscriptions | RSS - Top Stories Services Stuff Fibre | Newspapers in Education | A-Z Directories | Online Advertising | Print Advertising | Careers Classifieds Death Notices | Celebrations | Trade Me | Jobs | Property | Motors | Accommodation | Personals | Newspaper Classifieds Newspapers Dominion Post | The Press | Waikato Times | Auckland Now | Sunday News | Sunday Star-Times   Marlborough Express | Manawatu Standard | Nelson Mail | Southland Times | Taranaki Daily News | Timaru Herald Other Sites Essential Mums | Cuisine | NZ House & Garden | NZ Fishing News | NZ Life & Leisure | NZ Gardener | Fairfax Archives Breaking news?

UnGoogled Chromium Removes All the Googley Parts from Chromium GO UnGoogled Chromium available for free on GitHub & Softpedia Oct 16, 2016 22:30 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  UnGoogled Chromium is a custom version of the Chromium browser that doesn't include any type of Google services or features. UnGoogled Chromium is not a Google Chrome version, but a version of Chromium, the open-source browser which is at the base of Chrome, Vivaldi, and Opera. Chromium is not as Google-free as many people think While Chromium is an open-source project, it is a de-facto Google affair, with most contributors being Google engineers. As such, many of Chromium's features include many Google-specific services and aren't that agnostic as most people think. For example, Chromium comes pre-configured to use Google as the default search engine, uses Google's Safe Browsing API to scan every URL you visit, and loads a bunch of Google binaries to power all sorts of internal services. This means that there is a lot of user data still being sent to Google's servers, despite using an open-source project, and not Chrome. Developer exorcises Google from Chromium A developer named Eloston has set out to fix this, and has forked the Chromium source code so he can remove any traces of Google from the Chromium source code. In a GitHub README, he says he disabled the Safe Browsing API, WebRTC, the Omnibox address bar search feature, and any functionality specific to Google domains, such as Google Host Detector, Google URL Tracker, Google Cloud Messaging, Google Hotwording, and others. He also removed all closed-source binaries Google was loading into Chromium and made other stylistic changes, such as automatic URL formatting (UnGoogled Chromium does not hide https:// in the address bar anymore). Additionally, UnGoogled Chromium also forces popups to open into tabs and allows users to save data from more types of URL schemes (categories). Below is a photo gallery of UnGoogled Chromium. As you can see, it looks just like any other Chromium-based browser. UnGoogled Chromium is available for Ubuntu, Debian, Mac, and Windows.

Cantech Letter The Very Best of Canadian Science and Technology Home About Us Archive Currently Trending Cantech Investment Conference ||| ||| Wireless Interviews Software Lists and Data Cleantech Life Sciences Hardware Gaming Opinion Science Fintech Facebook and Google partner on undersea cable from the U.S. to Asia October 16, 2016 By Dylan Waddell 2 Comments Share this: Twitter0 Google+1 Facebook0 Facebook and Google are planning to run underwater fiber optic cables all the way from Hong Kong to Los Angeles California. This 8,000+ mile long track of cable will connect North America to Asia with the sole purpose of bringing better internet speeds. The cable will begin construction at some point this year and is expected to be completed and in operation by 2018. It’s predicted that the capacity will be 120 terabits per second, that’s over 15,300 gigabytes a second, extremely impressive compared to what’s currently available on the North American market. “These underwater cables will help increase the total bandwidth available not just to the giants that build them, but for pretty much everyone else as well. And they improve the resilience of the global internet by increasing the number of routes that data can travel across the oceans. But more to the point, they also give Facebook and Google more control over the infrastructure they depend on,” Klint Finley from Wired.com reports. Many in Eastern Canada will know that trans-Atlantic connections do not belong solely to this century, nor to the last for that matter. In the tiny town of Hearts Content on the eastern end of Newfoundland they will soon be celebrating the 150th anniversary of the first ever subsea cable. This is where the first ever transatlantic cable began and it ended in Valentia Islan, Ireland over 1900 miles away. With the introduction of Industrial Revolution-era cable the communication time between Europe and North America was altered drastically. Instead of messages taking upwards of a week to reach landfall in Europe, one could now be telegraphed across in nearly no time at all. Originally the telegraphs exchanged between the two points were a visual morse code. The system used lighting instead of the much more famous dots, dashes, and spaces we see in moves. Visual morse code required three people to convey the contents of a message and also a dark room to be able to see the light. Despite the strenuous methods of relaying messages, it was loved by the people everywhere as they could know in a near instant what was happening across the Atlantic Ocean, something we now take for granted. “These people were the first texters,” says Tara Bishop, an employee at the Heart’s Content Cable Museum. “It’s like us turning on a news network and watching the ticker tape running across the bottom of the screen of news headlines or stock markets. That’s what these people provided to the world,” But despite the popularity, the system was still very expensive, costing around 1 British Pound per word sent. But people quickly caught on and began shortening and combining words, a trend that continues even up until this day (LOL). “They were shortening words and combining words to make it more feasible to send their messages.” adds Bishop. Although this cable system has been disconnected since the 1960’s researchers are looking at using old subsea communication cables to help track temperatures and other information that could lead to a better understanding of climate change. But for now that dream is just slightly out of reach.

Were you one of the people inconvenienced by Samsung when they recalled all their Galaxy Note 7 units? Were you denied boarding your scheduled flight because you refused to turn in your Galaxy Note 7, which is now banned from all U.S. and Canadian aircraft? Or worse, did you witness, first-hand, your brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 7 unit catching on fire while you left it charging? Well, we forgive you; you didn’t know better. No one did, actually. We were all captured by the beautiful new Galaxy Note 7 that Samsung lured us with, not knowing it would bite us back in the end. So if you did turn over your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (if you haven’t, better do so now) or you’ve almost purchased one, then you might want to consider these other Android smartphones, which can even outdo some of the Galaxy Note 7’s features, and for a far better price, too. But of course, if you’re just going to pick up the new iPhone 7 Plus instead, by all means, do so. If you have been a fan of the Google Cardboard, then wait until you see Google’s new techie toy, the Google Pixel XL. If you don’t mind the 0.2 inches you’ll miss from the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, then you might take delight in this 5.5-inch Android smartphone. In fact, you’ll find that display is a little bit crisper since the display area is a bit smaller than that of the Galaxy Note 7’s. Google Pixel XL delivers–for a price. [Image by Google] In terms of a camera, you’re in for a treat. CNet reports that the Google Pixel XL’s 12.3 MP is a real winner. Camera-testing website DxOMark gave the Google Pixel XL’s camera a score of 89, the highest rating a smartphone camera has ever received. Apparently, one of the factors that really stood out is the camera’s outstanding Autofocus feature, which is extremely fast and accurate. The Google Pixel XL also runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, making it not only Google’s very first smartphone, but the very first to be compatible with Google’s new virtual reality system, Daydream. Forbes notes that the Google Pixel XL also promises a seven-hour battery life with just 15 minutes of charging time, although this, of course, will vary with continued usage. Although we did promise you a better price, the Google Pixel XL is not really a much cheaper alternative to the Galaxy Note 7. With its impeccable specs making this smartphone a premium phone to watch, setting you back $769 for the 32GB model is a fair price to pay. Wondering what’s the release date for the Google Pixel XL? The Google Pixel XL will be available in stores October 20. Another 5.5-inch smartphone that can easily bully the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is the Huawei P9 Plus, which is Huawei’s finest creation yet. Pocket-Lint played with the Huawei P9 Plus, and they’re returning with smiles on their faces. Packed with a Kirin 955 processor and a generous 4 GB RAM, you won’t need to worry about performance issues and data processing. And what’s more interesting is that despite its powerful core, the Huawei P9 Plus can run for two straight days on a single charge on normal usage. Huawei P9 Plus is a bigger and badder Huawei P9 [Image by Chainupong Hiporn / Shutterstock.com] In terms of camera, because everyone these days are just so obsessed with the camera, the Huawei P9 Plus comes strong and fierce. Fitted with a powerful Leica lens and offering an array of shooting modes, you’ll never go wrong with this one. Sold yet? Well, getting the Huawei P9 Plus will save you $200 from getting the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, so that’s a pretty good bargain given the top-notch features and performance the Huawei P9 Plus delivers. Another interesting unit that has been lurking in the shadows for a while now is the OnePlus 3. Also sporting a large 5.5-inch screen, a 1080p AMOLED display, and a whopping 6 GB RAM, the OnePlus 3 is a real smooth talker in terms of display and performance. According to Engadget, it comes with a customized OxygenOS, which provides a wide variety of customization and options that a real nit-picker will appreciate. OnePlus 3 is very competitive price wise. [Image by Esa Riutta / Shutterstock.com] While the camera of the OnePlus 3 won’t completely overpower that of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7’s, it’s a pretty decent player at 16 MP. With optimum image stabilization and excellent phase-detection autofocus, you can’t really complain. It’s pretty, it’s powerful, and most of all, it’s cheap. At $399, the OnePlus 3 will definitely deliver that bang for your buck. Are you considering these Galaxy Note 7 alternatives or will you stick around and wait for a new Samsung flagship that will supposedly knock your socks off?

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Monday, November 14, 2016 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? Policy Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? By Jeneba Ghatt - 2:30pm July 18, 2011 7182 63 SHARE Facebook Twitter For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google’s latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project. It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

 Google's nit-picky interview process is a huge turnoff for some experienced coders Julie Bort Oct. 16, 2016, 10:35 AM 100,431 facebook linkedin twitter email print Alphabet CEO Larry Page and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. AP Photo/Jeff Chiu By just about any measure, Google is one of the best companies a software programmer can work for, between its high pay, free food, playground of a campus, and the interesting tech it creates.  But in one important way, the company may have shot itself in the foot: its legendarily difficult interview process. Google is right now being sued on allegations of age discrimination by a couple of job candidates who didn't get offered a job there. Google is fighting the suit and calls the allegations "without merit." The suit may very well be without merit, but some programmers believe the company has designed its tough recruitment process to heavily favor those fresh from school with less real-world experience. In fact, that notorious interview process caused freelance programmer Michael Geary simply not to apply for a full-time job at Google even after he had worked as a contract programmer for the company for five years, he told Business Insider. Google knows he's a Google Maps expert Back in late 2007, Geary had been working at a startup called Zvents, a company which created local event calendars (it was later acquired by StubHub). freelance programmer Michael Geary Michael Geary His job was to build maps to events, so he had become an expert with programming using Google Maps. As a friendly, helpful fellow, he spent a lot of time on the Google Maps mailing list helping other programmers with their questions. Google took notice and hired him to help it build an election map for the 2oo8 presidential election. Although he lives near the Googleplex in Mountain View, he was attached to a team working in Washington, D.C. They liked his work and he enjoyed working with them, so he continued on a contract basis for another five years. At that point, Google pulled the project in-house. He faced a choice: apply to join Google, either with this team or another, or move on to another contract job. He opted to move on.  "I heard about this interview process," Geary said, "It seemed fine-tuned for people just out of college. When you are just out college, there's a lot of algorithms, and data structures and fast-thinking on a whiteboard, like you do in school. As opposed to real software engineering, there's a lot of other stuff that goes into that. In my real work, in 20 years, I've never used a whiteboard. I use my computer. But in job interviews they do it all the time." He said he feared the process would be "quizzes about algorithmic minutiae and having to code a red-black tree on the spot on a whiteboard — all things that favor recent CS grads." He's not alone in this attitude Earlier this week, a blog post went viral on Hacker News, a site where programmers chat about news of interest to them, from Pierre Gauthier, a man with 37 years of coding experience and 24 years of R&D director experience. Thomson Reuters Gauthier, founder and CEO of TWD Industries, wrote that he never applied to Google but was called and asked to apply for a director of engineering job. So he agreed to a phone interview. He posted the questions he was asked in the interview and the recruiter's reply, coupled with his inner monologue about it all. Basically, the recruiter was asking a list of technical questions and believed that there was only one "right" answer, he said. According to the blog post: "Google's representative stated that both management and up-to-date coding skills were required (a rare mix). But having exercised the former for more than 2 decades and the latter for almost 4 decades was not enough: I failed to give the 'right answers.'" His inner monologue basically shredded the recruiter's "right" answer to pieces, pointing out other technical solutions that were better. But perhaps the most famous story is how Google rejected a programmer named Max Howell in 2015. Howell is well known for creating a popular programming tool called Homebrew. Howell vented his frustration in a tweet that went viral. The tweet said, "Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*&k off." He later explained in another tweet, "I was rejected this morning. But it was a flippant tweet." Howell told Business Insider, "For me the situation was: Google really needed a plumber, so I turned up with 20 years of experience and all the right tools (some of which I'd developed myself), but then they insisted on quizzing me on fluid dynamics before they'd let me fix their leak." Happy endings Ironically, after Geary talked about not applying in a post on Hacker News last week, a product manager for the mapping team replied and told him that he did want to hire him and tried to get Google to fund the position, but got turned down. Geary says that not applying to Google back then, "could have been a mistake on my part," although he still has no intention of applying now. Meanwhile, Max Howell landed at Apple.  And Gauthier updated his blog post to say that after the post went viral, he received an outpouring of job offers (that he didn't need) and resumes of people wanting to come work for him. "Google cold-called me - I was not seeking a job. I founded TWD 18 years ago," he told us, adding that he believes his company's "'post-quantum' security technology is way ahead of today's academic R&D." When we asked Google to respond to criticism that its interview process favors new college grads, a spokesperson told us: "From hundreds of thousands of interviews, we hire thousands of engineers every year -- from new college grads to people with decades of experience. The process is well known to be rigorous, but we get consistently positive feedback from interviewees. Of course, with that many interviews taking place, there are some candidates who come away unhappy. We want more great people from a range of backgrounds and ages to apply to work here, so are very grateful for their feedback."

(Associated Press files) By ANICK JESDANUN, Associated Press Published: October 16, 2016, 6:05 AM A   A If you’re like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you’ve posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. They don’t have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called “machine learning” to organize your pictures and video — and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple’s tools are part of last month’s iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories — and Google signaled recently that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here’s a look at how they take you down memory lane: • APPLE’S MEMORIES. Apple’s new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn’t just a slideshow. There’s slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you’re ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file — so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple’s app created a “Florida to Illinois” package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a “Together” package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an “At The Beach” package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to “Related.” You can also add or delete images within Memories — in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let’s face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren’t necessarily ones I’d choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they’re presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually … someday. • GOOGLE’S ASSISTANT. Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image. Unlike typical “GIF” animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady — without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google’s Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation — although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn’t require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes, such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google’s choices aren’t necessarily ones I’d make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called “Rediscover this day.” Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you’ll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. • SEARCHING. Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple’s version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. • STORAGE. To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you’re online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition — good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple’s iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos.

The 21-year-old company, once a dominant force in Silicon Valley, is now close to sale, with final bids due Monday and observers expecting that the firm will be broken up. Experts say Yahoo committed fatal errors in the fast-paced, hypercompetitive tech world — it didn’t innovate fast enough, clung to a stale business model and failed to blow its own horn. “Part of what makes Silicon Valley an exciting place to be and to study is the amazing ability of many of the companies there to engage in effective self-promotion. Yahoo, possibly because of its performance problems and possibly because of its leadership changes, has really fallen down on that mark,” said Jo-Ellen Pozner, UC Berkeley Haas School of Business professor “There are ways to keep customers and investors and the public engaged in your story even if you’re not delivering. A little bit of hype really never hurt anybody, especially when your stock price is tanking,” she said. Instead, Yahoo has been steamrolled by Silicon Valley competitors Google and Facebook, which have grown to dominate digital advertising. The two are raking in 64 percent of online ad revenue in the U.S., according to Pivotal Research. Both firms are known for continuously rolling out new products and services and developing an impassioned user base. Meanwhile, Yahoo is expected to capture just 1.5 percent of the global digital ad market this year, down from 2.1 percent in 2015, according to digital advertising consultancy eMarketer. Yahoo’s travails are often laid at the door of CEO Marissa Mayer, who arrived from Google in 2012 to become Yahoo’s fourth CEO in four years. Mayer quickly went on a buying spree, spending more than $2 billion on dozens of companies. In 2013, Yahoo hired news anchor Katie Couric for more than $6 million a year and raised her compensation to $10 million last year. This year, Yahoo shuttered seven digital magazines and laid off more than 300 California workers as it seeks to cut 15 percent of its workforce by year’s end. When Mayer landed at Yahoo, the firm’s market capitalization — the combined value of all shares not owned by the corporation — stood at $25.9 billion and had climbed to $42.1 billion in 2014. The value fell precipitously last year to $34.9 billion. And in April, Yahoo announced its first-quarter revenue had fallen 18 percent to $859 million, the biggest quarterly drop since Mayer took over. It also suffered a $99 million quarterly loss and its market cap now stands at $35.8 billion. The company reports second-quarter earnings Monday, the same day final offers are expected. Bidders, according to reports based mostly on anonymous sources, include Verizon, AT&T, Quicken Loans co-founder Dan Gilbert backed by Warren Buffett, and private equity companies. Sale-price estimates hover around $6 billion. In its defense, Yahoo consistently points to its 1 billion monthly users and says its News and Finance sites are No. 1 in viewership in their categories, according to comScore ratings. But to many observers, expansive metrics don’t tell the real story. “Big numbers don’t necessarily mean success,” said Michael Malone, a journalist and longtime Silicon Valley watcher. “You can have a lot of users, a huge installed base, a huge market cap, but you’re dying of old age, you’re rotting from the inside. When was the last time anyone talked about Yahoo as interesting or compelling or innovative?” Companies perceived as interesting and innovative, such as Facebook and Google, have kept their product-focus sharp, while Yahoo has done the opposite, said Forrester Research analyst Shar VanBoskirk. The firm has spun out its offerings from search to a wide variety of products, from news to mail to video programming to hosting blogs. While Google has also wheeled out an array of products, its dominance in search gives consumers a strong touchpoint, VanBoskirk said. “The thing it (Google) did so well that Yahoo missed on is it stood for a clear utility and clear use,” VanBoskirk said. “The Yahoo brand doesn’t stand for anything anymore, which is their whole problem. They said, ‘We are going to be your all-purpose portal.’ “ Malone sees Yahoo’s business model as a throwback to the ’80s and ’90s. In contrast to Google’s ability to launch users wherever they want to go in the web, Yahoo is a “closed system,” Malone said. “You’re supposed to enter into this complete world where you get all the experiences you supposedly want,” he said. “They want to keep you in the castle.” To Pozner, Yahoo has essentially lost its Silicon Valley mojo, and with it, the interest of an otherwise tech-obsessed public and its ability to lure tech talent. “The company has been mining its existing customer base and not necessarily providing new value to attract new customers,” Pozner said. “Once the organization stops being known for innovation, then it stops attracting the people who are excited by innovation.” However, Yahoo still generates affection, even among people who seldom interact with it, and that loyalty may be an attractive asset in the company’s sale, VanBoskirk said. “It’s a funny thing. Even if people don’t use Yahoo a lot or know what the brand stands for, they like it. They root for it. They feel kind of warm and fuzzy to the brand, even after it’s reached its point of uselessness.” Contact Ethan Baron at 408-920-5011 or follow him at Twitter.com/ethanbaron.

By: Tech Desk | Published:October 16, 2016 2:15 pm Google Allo doesn’t require an email ID to sign-in and needs only a mobile number to get started. We’re seeing a new trend with Google, which has started advertising its products on the homepage. And looks like its Allo’s turn now. Barely days after the Search giant started putting up ads on its homepage for Pixel smartphones and video-messaging app Duo; has now come up with a text banner for its messaging app. Android Police, which first spotted the ad on Google’s homepage, put out a screenshot of the same. “If you visit the search homepage (at the time of this writing), you will see a text banner that says – Say hello to Google Allo, smart messaging for Android and iOS,” the report said. Google Allo was launched was first announced at the annual I/O conference in 2016 along with Duo (a video-messaging app). Google Allo was rolled out on September 21 and the app crossed 5 million downloads within eight days on the Play Store. Allo is powered by the company’s new machine-learning assistant – Google Assistant – which gives users a more personal experience. The chat gives you auto suggestions for quick replies. Google Allo doesn’t require an email ID to sign-in and needs only a mobile number to get started. According to Google, the company is looking to bring the Hindi version of Google Assistant as well, though the Assistant already understands Hinglish. Given the focus on Hindi, Hinglish, it is clear the app is geared towards the Indian market, which has growing importance for Google.

(Sean Proctor/The New York Times)   By Quentin Hardy The New York Times Oct. 16, 2016   Today’s Business stories Festive farming: Harvest time comes for Willamette Valley Christmas tree growers For some, pets at work take edge off ‘ruff’ days Tiny-home market more bust than boom Business Datebook Business Beat More Business »   Jason Mars is an African-American professor of computer science who also runs a tech startup. When his company’s artificially intelligent smartphone app talks, he said, it sounds “like a helpful, young Caucasian female.” “There’s a kind of pressure to conform to the prejudices of the world” when you are trying to make a consumer hit, he said. “It would be interesting to have a black guy talk, but we don’t want to create friction, either. First we need to sell products.” Mars’ startup is part of a growing high-tech field called conversational computing. This technology is being popularized by programs such as the Siri system in Apple’s iPhone, and Alexa, which is built into the Echo, Amazon’s artificially intelligent home computing device. Conversational computing is holding a mirror to many of society’s biggest preconceptions around race and gender. Listening and talking are the new input and output devices of computers. But they have social and emotional dimensions never seen with keyboards and screens. Do we, for example, associate the stereotypical voice of an English butler — think of Jarvis the computer in “Iron Man” — with a helpful and intelligent person? And why do so many people want to hear a voice that sounds like it came from a younger woman with no discernible accent? Choosing a voice has implications for design, branding or interacting with machines. A voice can change or harden how we see each other. Where commerce is concerned, that creates a problem: Is it better to succeed by complying with a stereotype, or risk failure in the market by going against type? Considering gender For many, the answer is initially clear. Microsoft’s artificially intelligent voice system is Cortana, for example, and it was originally the voice of a female character in the video game “Halo.” “In our research for Cortana, both men and women prefer a woman, younger, for their personal assistant, by a country mile,” said Derek Connell, senior vice president for search at Microsoft. In other words, a secretary — a job that is traditionally seen as female. This month, Google introduced a number of voice-based products, including Google Home, its version of Echo. All of them use Google Assistant, which also speaks in tones associated with a young, educated woman. Google Assistant “is a millennial librarian who understands cultural cues, and can wink at things,” said Ryan Germick, who leads the personality efforts in building Google Assistant. “Products aren’t about rational design decisions. They are about psychology and how people feel.” The company has had internal debates about whether to respond differently on questions to the computer about suicide, Connell said. “We’ve leaned to providing information about suicide prevention everywhere,” he said, as opposed to offering no advice at all. But sometimes, if you want people to figure out quickly that they are talking to a machine, it can be better to have a man’s voice. For example, IBM’s Watson, when it talks to Bob Dylan in television commercials, has a male voice. When Ashok Goel, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, adapted Watson to have a female voice as an informal experiment in how people relate to conversational machines, his students couldn’t tell it was a computer. But Watson’s maleness is the exception. Amazon’s A.I. technology is another in the comforting female voice camp. “Alexa was always an assistant, and female,” said Peng Shao, who worked at Amazon on the Echo and is now at a Seattle startup, building another speech-based A.I. system. Amazon would not comment on its product. “You need a persona” Gender is just the starting point. Can your A.I. technology understand accents? And can it respond in a way that feels less robotic and at least mimics some sort of human empathy? “You need a persona,” Shao said. “It’s a very emotional thing — people would get red, even get violent, if it didn’t understand them. When it did understand them, it felt like magic. They sleep next to them. This is heading for hospitals, senior care, a lot of sensitive places.” Capital One developed a banking app on Alexa, and found it had to dial down the computer’s formality to make people comfortable talking about their finances with a computer. “Money is inextricably linked to emotion, enabling and preventing things in your life,” said Stephanie Hay, the head of content strategy, culture and A.I. design at Capital One. At first the app said, “Hello,” but that seemed too tense. “ ‘Hi, there’ worked better,” she said. “She’s my friend, hanging out with me in the kitchen. I need her to be reliable and approachable, but not invasive.” We don’t just need that computerized voice to meet our expectations, said Justine Cassell, a professor at Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. We need computers to relate to us and put us at ease when performing a task. “We have to know that the other is enough like us that it will run our program correctly,” she said. That need seems to start young. Cassell has designed an avatar of indeterminate race and gender for 5-year-olds. “The girls think it’s a girl, and the boys think it’s a boy,” she said. “Children of color think it’s of color, Caucasians think it’s Caucasian.” Another system she built spoke in what she termed “vernacular” to African-­American children, achieving better results in teaching scientific concepts than when the computer spoke in standard English. When tutoring the children in a class presentation, however, “we wanted it to practice with them in ‘proper English.’ Standard American English is still the code of power, so we needed to develop an agent that would train them in code switching,” she said. And, of course, there are regional issues to consider when creating a robotic voice. For Cortana, Microsoft has had to tweak things like accents, as well as languages, and the jokes Cortana tells for different countries. If a French driver goes into Germany using driving directions voiced by Nuance Communications, the computer will mispronounce the name of a German town with a French accent. The idea is to keep the driver confident by sustaining the illusion that the computer is French. Mars’ company, called Clinc, makes personal financial smartphone software that answers questions like “how much can I spend on a computer?” It relies on a similar Google-created female voice. He is hoping for enough success that he can eventually test and counter stereotypes with unexpected A.I. voices. “You need to be at a certain size before you can address these questions,” said Mars, who teaches at the University of Michigan. But maybe not too big. “I think consumers will eventually be open to exploring different voices and types,” he said. “Companies, they’ll probably stay conservative about it.” More Business articles »     RG Daily Digest Get our top headlines delivered to your inbox.         Today’s Business stories Business Festive farming: Harvest time comes for Willamette Valley Christmas tree growers Business For some, pets at work take edge off ‘ruff’ days Business Tiny-home market more bust than boom Business Apple shows  it’s out of touch Business Business Datebook Business Business Beat     Local Healthcare Lane County shoppers find higher costs, fewer health plans on insurance exchange Open enrollment is operating as usual despite President-elect Trump’s pledge to repeal the law Lane County residents who buy their health insurance on the exchange created by the federal Affordable Care Act may be wondering what to do because of President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to repeal the act.

Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called “machine learning” to organize your pictures and video – and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple’s tools are part of last month’s iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories – and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here’s a look at how they take you down memory lane: Apple’s Memories Apple’s new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn’t just a slideshow. There’s slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you’re ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file – so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple’s app created a “Florida to Illinois” package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a “Together” package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an “At The Beach” package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to “Related.” You can also add or delete images within Memories – in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let’s face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren’t necessarily ones I’d choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they’re presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually … someday. Google’s Assistant Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout. Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so they resemble a moving image. Unlike typical “GIF” animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady – without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google’s Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation – although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn’t require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes, such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google’s choices aren’t necessarily ones I’d make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called “Rediscover this day.” Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you’ll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. Searching Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple’s version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. Storage To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you’re online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition – good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple’s iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos.

But a few of designers are still dreaming of a phone that is easily upgraded and repaired. Adele Peters 10.13.16 1:45 PM When a Dutch design student unveiled a concept for a fully modular phone in 2013, his goal was to eliminate waste. By turning every component into a tiny removable block, he reasoned, it would be possible to easily repair or upgrade phones that would have been quickly trashed in the past. The idea, called Phonebloks, was later wrapped into Google's Project Ara—though Google's take on it focused more on swappable parts than longevity. Then came the news that Google was cancelling plans to make the phone, leading to questions about whether modular phones have a real future—and whether those phones can help solve the ballooning problem of e-waste. Project Ara. [Image: via Google/Project Ara] "For phones, modularity may seem like a good idea, but in reality, I think it is ultimately not making devices more sustainable," says product designer Mike Simonian, co-founder of Mike and Maaike, who previously helped Google build an industrial design team. "It may allow people to upgrade rather than buying a new device but this will only delay a complete upgrade, as the entire system will pretty quickly become outdated." The Project Ara phone, a frame with parts that could be added and removed, was designed to let users add features like a camera or extra speaker as needed or customize at the store. "Sustainability is in there, but I don't think it's the key focus," says Josh Morenstein, founder and creative director of Branch Creative, which worked on the Ara design. "It is possible. You're still getting rid of a lot of the product every time you swap out a component, though." PuzzlePhone If a new display comes out, for example, you're still getting rid of the old display. In some cases, especially because the electronics on phones are so integrated now, making parts modular might mean more materials are used in manufacturing up-front, and again for each part that's replaced. "Imagine it's like Legos," says Morenstein. "Every Lego block has six sides to it. So when you replace that Lego block and put another block on there, you're still getting rid of a block. That Lego block has all this plastic around it, it has microchips in it, depending what it is . . . in a way, there's more materials on this modular architecture than there is on a standard phone." PuzzlePhone, a Finland-based modular phone project, argues that if someone replaces one of its parts, someone else can reuse it. The phone is designed with removable parts—a "brain" with electronic guts, a frame with a high-res display, and a "heart" with a battery and more electronics. The electronics and screen are designed to last 10 years and the battery, three years. PuzzlePhone "Many users will only seek more processing power, a fresh battery or to repair their screen once every 10 years, and these cases do not happen at same time, so you can replace only that bit, and you still have a valuable module in your pocket—unless broken—that someone else can use," says Alejandro Santacreu, CEO and founder of Circular Devices OY, the company making the PuzzlePhone. It's a noble idea, and there's no reason why a screen and a battery, at least, shouldn't be easily replaceable by users rather than by a manufacturer. FairPhone, a social good-minded Dutch company, also uses modularity to make its phone more repairable. But it's unclear how well a phone that lasts a decade will do on the mainstream market. Some of the product churn is driven by manufacturers through planned obsolescence. But to some extent, it comes from consumer demand for improving technology as well. "Every year, new processors come out and the rest of the components of a phone need to work well with that processor," says Simonian. "All of these other components are constantly being improved as well. So if you upgrade one part of a phone, the rest of it will quickly become outdated. Technology in phones changes more rapidly than almost any other product category so I don't think a phone would ever be a BIFL item." Kyle Wiens, founder of iFixit, a site that helps people learn to repair their own electronics, thinks that the secondary market solves the problem, at least in part, by itself. "Everyone wants to make their phone last 10 years," he says. "But why? The free market provides modularity. If you want a better camera, just sell your phone to someone who needs it and buy a new one with a better camera. The more important thing is that your old phone stays in use by someone and is repaired when it breaks." An alternative approach to making phones more sustainable could be to focus on making them much easier to disassemble and recycle. "I think when we're able to design consumer electronics where we can take all of the elements and essentially melt them down and turn them into something else or make a new phone, I think that's where it starts to become more magical," says Morenstein. "Things are changing so fast through these product cycles and what you can do that it almost doesn’t make sense to say we can sell your phone and somebody else can use it." In the meantime, PuzzlePhone is still working to bring its modular phone to market and plans to prove that it can work. Though some expected European Commission funding was delayed, it expects to have a prototype in six months. It argues that typical phones—which it compares to cars with parts glued together, so that you'd have to throw out the whole car if one part breaks—are designed for manufacturers to be able to sell more. Dave Hakkens, the designer who originally proposed Phonebloks, thinks that might be true. "For me, that's never really a reason not to chase the thing that is good," he says. "Then I guess it's a case of finding a way to make that profit without making that much waste." Hakkens also expects the fledging industry of modular phones to keep growing. "I still believe that a lot of people want it and it makes sense," he says. "Slowly you see more companies and initiatives doing more modular stuff. Step by step. I definitely think there's more room for modularity in the future." Have something to say about this article? You can email us and let us know.
