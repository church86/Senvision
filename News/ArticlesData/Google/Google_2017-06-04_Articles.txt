Wall Street Journal’s Google traffic drops 44% after pulling out of First Click Free Despite less traffic, paid subscriber conversion said to be up fourfold. Danny Sullivan on June 5, 2017 at 4:48 pm More In February, The Wall Street Journal stopped participating in a program allowing Google visitors to bypass its paywall. The publication has now discovered, as was predicted, that it no longer gets as much traffic from Google. In an interview with Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal reported that its Google traffic plunged 44 percent after leaving the “First Click Free” program. First Click Free allows visitors from Google to access articles that are normally behind paywalls for free, when they click to them from Google’s search results. Many publishers participate in the program because they find the traffic and related ad-revenue offsets potential lost subscription revenue. When a publisher is not in the program, Google cannot fully index the articles it publishes. That means those articles are less likely to appear for a wider range of topics. That can hurt potential traffic from Google. In addition, such articles are also listed with a “subscription” designation next to them, which might put off some people who lack subscriptions from clicking through. The WSJ seems a bit surprised and possibly upset over the traffic drop. Suzi Watford, the Journal’s chief marketing officer, said in an interview with Bloomberg: “Any site like ours automatically doesn’t get the visibility in search that a free site would. … You are definitely being discriminated against as a paid news site.” It was pretty clear from Google’s own rules, as I’ve covered before, that such a traffic drop was likely. The WSJ certainly knew it could happen and deliberately chose to leave the program. From my previous article, it told me: We are constantly experimenting with different ways to enhance the digital experience for members. As a continuation of this, the Journal has broadened its test by removing content available through Google’s First Click Free. The test began last month when the Journal removed four sections, resulting in subscription growth driven directly from content. What’s also important here is that while the WSJ’s overall traffic has dropped, it had — as Bloomberg notes — a fourfold increase in subscription conversions. Losing that traffic and the potential ad revenue with it may well have been offset or exceeded by subscription revenue — which was the original stated goal. Also to the WSJ’s benefit, Google is only showing a “subscription” designation when stories appear in Google News, like this: However, Google fails to show such a designation in its regular search results, as shown below: I’d long been under the impression that Google would use a “subscription” designation for any type of subscription content in web search results. It’s something I recall in the past for when Google Scholar content appeared. However, Google tells me the designation is only used within Google News, not within regular Google search results. It doesn’t even show when subscription content appears in the “Top stories” section of Google search. About The Author Danny Sullivan Danny Sullivan is a Founding Editor of Search Engine Land.

But there was a trade-off: Traffic from Google plummeted 44 percent. The reason: Google search results are based on an algorithm that scans the Internet for free content. After the Journal’s articles went behind a paywall, Google’s bot only saw the first few paragraphs and started ranking them lower, limiting viewership. Executives at the Journal, owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., argue that Google’s policy is unfairly punishing them for trying to attract more digital subscribers. They want Google to treat their articles equally in search rankings, despite being behind a paywall. “Any site like ours automatically doesn’t get the visibility in search that a free site would,” Suzi Watford, the Journal’s chief marketing officer, said in an interview. “You are definitely being discriminated against as a paid news site.” Latest business videos The Journal’s experience could have implications across the news industry, where publishers are relying more on persuading readers to pay for their articles because tech giants like Google and Facebook are vacuuming up the lion’s share of online advertising. With Google, publishers try to strike a balance. While they may want to sign up more subscribers by not giving away free articles, they also don’t want their content to drop in search results, which drives traffic to their sites and can boost advertising sales. For that reason, many outlets with subscription businesses let Google users read at least one free article so they still rank high in search results. Google says its “first click free” policy is good for both consumers and publishers. People want to get the news quickly and don’t want to immediately encounter a paywall. Plus, if publishers let Google users sample articles for free, there’s a better chance they’ll end up subscribing, Google says. The Mountain View company likens its policy to stores allowing people to flip through newspapers and magazines before choosing which one to buy. The Journal decided to stop letting people read articles free from Google after discovering nearly 1 million people each month were abusing the three-article limit. They would copy and paste Journal headlines into Google and read the articles for free, then clear their cookies to reset the meter and read more, Watford said. The Journal now only lets Google users see a short snippet at the top of its articles, restricting the rest to its 2.2 million subscribers or people who arrive via social media. In the most recent quarter, the Journal’s digital subscribers grew about 30 percent compared with the prior year, driven partly by barring Google users from reading for free. Google, meanwhile, displays a “subscription” label next to Journal articles in Google News search results, alerting users that they won’t be getting a full article. Gerry Smith is a Bloomberg writer.

Jun, 2017, 19:01 ET Share this article LONDON, June 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The technology giants Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook take the Top 5 places in the 2017 BrandZTM Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking released today by WPP and Kantar Millward Brown.      (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/513554/Kantar_Millward_Brown_Logo.jpg ) Amazon achieved the highest dollar value growth of all brands in the Top 100 ranking, increasing by $40.3 billion (+41%) to $139.3bn to take the no. 4 position. The retail giant has continued to focus on its technology ecosystem honed to meet multiple consumer needs such as online shopping, rapid delivery and entertainment, as well as introducing new artificial intelligence-enabled services including grocery delivery and personal assistant Alexa.  Google, Apple and Microsoft retain the top three positions, growing their brand value +7% to $245.6bn, +3% to $234.7bn and +18% to $143.2bn respectively over the past year, while Facebook, at no. 5, grew +27% to $129.8bn. 25% of the total value of the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands is made up of the combined brand value of the Top 5, emphasising their dominant positions in the modern business landscape.  David Roth, CEO EMEA and Asia, The Store WPP, says: "This year's BrandZ global top 100 continues to demonstrate that strong brands deliver superior shareholder value and returns regardless of disruptive external climates. Dubbed the 'The Frightful Five' by some, the tech giants that head the rankings are more like the 'Fearsome Five' to their competitors, given their huge brand power and a seemingly unassailable market position." Other highlights in this year's ranking include Chinese brand Tencent (no.8), which saw increased use of its social platform WeChat and entered the Top 10 for the first time, with a brand value increase of +27% to $108.3bn. Adidas was the fastest riser by percentage growth (+58%, $8.3bn), followed by Chinese premium alcohol brand Moutai (+48%, $17bn).  As the largest and definitive brand-building platform in the world, BrandZ reflects the brands that are integrated into today's consumer lifestyles. It is the only brand valuation study to combine interviews with over three million consumers globally with analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel). This year, the total brand value of the Top 100 brands has risen +8% to $3.64 trillion, compared with +3% in 2016, while the number of brands worth more than $100bn has increased from six to nine. The total brand value of the ranking is up +152% from 2006 (its first year), as its composition has shifted towards innovative, consumer-focused technology brands with huge reach and brand-building power. The BrandZ Top 10 in 2017 are worth almost as much as the entire Top 100 in 2006 ($1.42tn vs $1.44tn), and have grown +249% in value, compared with +152% for the Top 100 as a whole.  The value of the BrandZ Top 100 Global Brands confirms that strong brands continue to outperform their competitors. Compared against key benchmarks over the past 12 years, the portfolio of BrandZ Top 100 brands grew 50% more in value than the S&P 500 and 3.5 times the MSCI All Country World Index. The 2017 ranking shows that the balance of power has truly tipped towards the consumer-focused technology brands that develop ecosystems that cater to many needs, simplifying an increasingly complex world. More than half of the Top 100's total brand value is contributed by technology-related brands (a definition that includes telecoms and online retailers), up from a third in 2006, and these have grown +16% in the last year compared with +4% for non-tech brands. Nine of the Top 10 are technology-related brands, as are all seven of the newcomers to the Top 100 in 2017: XFinity, YouTube, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Salesforce, Netflix, Snapchat and Sprint. Retail was the fastest rising category, increasing +14% in value over the last 12 months, driven by ecommerce brands such as Amazon and Alibaba which, like many native internet companies, continued to add physical stores to their sales channels. Overall the value growth of pure online retailers has increased +388% since 2006, while traditional retailers dropped -23% as they took longer to adapt their offering to include online. The technology category grew +13%, while fast food was this year's third highest growing category (+7%), as the leading brands introduced fresh food and value menus as well as customer touchpoints innovations that enhance the brand experience.

 In terms of regions, US brands dominate the ranking, with 54 brands in the BrandZ Top 100, worth 71% of the total brand value. In the last year these brands have grown +12% compared with an overall -1% decline for brands with origins in the rest of the world except China where overall brand growth, excluding state-owned enterprises, was +11%. The top 20 B2B brands increased their value by 11%. Microsoft remains at no. 1 growing +10% to $143.2bn, while Shell is the fastest B2B riser, increasing +23% to $18.3bn. The ranking also shows that as the digital world creates overlap between business and consumer environments, the border between B2B and B2C is disappearing, creating B2H (Business to Human) brands. Key trends highlighted in this year's BrandZ Global Top 100 study include: Consumer-centric technology ecosystems are making brands indispensable. Consumers can increasingly carry out a variety of activities, from online shopping to watching television, under the banner of one brand and across multiple devices. This convenience for consumers also allows the most powerful brands to minimise the risk of consumer switching. New brands are increasingly born global, allowing them to grow rapidly. Technology allows businesses to provide their offerings globally from day one. This is fostering a new breed of entrepreneur, who is not restricted by the geographical or sector boundaries that have traditionally limited the speed and scale of growth. Traditional non-tech brands are adopting technology to innovate and increase consumer appeal. Fastest riser Adidas has introduced 3D printing to produce its footwear, for example, while fast food brand Domino's Pizza offers customers a real-time tracker for their order. The BrandZ Top 100 is getting younger. The average age of a brand is now 67 years, compared with 84 years in 2006, reflecting the entry of the newer technology brands and the emergence of brand China. Brands that make it clear how they will make consumers' lives better, such as Huawei and Toyota, have grown three times more on average over the last 12 years (the top third grew +170% compared to the bottom third which was +57%). Great communications puts a brand at an advantage. The top third in terms of strongest communications (including McDonald's and L'Oréal Paris) have grown 196% in value, compared with 47% for the bottom third. This is because they have successfully amplified the difference they have built. Doreen Wang, Kantar Millward Brown's Global Head of BrandZ, comments: "This is the era of internet giants that have developed ever-growing ecosystems that touch and connect consumers, with the overall aim of making life easier, simpler and better. Technology with the consumer at its centre has redefined our expectations, and we now take for granted that products, services, tools and content are immediately available at our fingertips. These brands also demonstrate great elasticity - they confidently and comfortably play in new territories and new categories to develop and expand their customer bases."

About the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands Ranking  Carried out by WPP's marketing and brand consultancy Kantar Millward Brown, the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking is now in its twelfth year. It is the only study to combine measures of brand equity based on interviews with over three million consumers globally about thousands of global 'consumer facing' and business-to-business brands with a rigorous analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel) to separate the value that brand plays in driving business and shareholder value. Consumer perception of a brand is a key input in determining brand value because brands are a combination of business performance, product delivery, clarity of positioning, and leadership. The ranking takes into account regional variations since, even for truly global brands, measures of brand contribution might differ substantially across countries.

It's brand valuation nudged up by 5% to $143 billion. Amazon has been on fire over the past year and its brand value surged by 41% to hit $139 billion. Google's brand is associated with innovative research, self-driving cars and helpful online services like Google Drive, Google Docs and Google Maps. Apple's brand value nudged up by 3% to $235 billion, helping it retain the No. 2 position in the ranking. But the brand has lost some shine since 2015 when it topped the BrandZ ranking. By Alanna Petroff LONDON (CNNMoney) -- China now has one of the world's most valuable brands. Shenzhen-based tech firm Tencent has broken into a ranking of the top 10 most valuable brands published by BrandZ. The annual ranking is typically dominated by American companies with global reach, making the inclusion of a Chinese firm notable. Tencent specializes in popular online games, apps, instant messaging services and online payments. It boasts a market capitalization of $330 billion, making it worth more than America's most valuable bank: JPMorgan Chase. Here's a round-up of the world's 10 most valuable brands: 1. Google Google is still the most valuable brand in the world; a title it has retained for seven out of the past 11 years. It's brand value -- worth just over $245 billion -- increased by 7% from 2016. The company has transformed itself from a simple search engine to an all-encompassing lifestyle brand, said Doreen Wang, Global Head of BrandZ. Google's brand is associated with innovative research, self-driving cars and helpful online services like Google Drive, Google Docs and Google Maps. Bonus: The company consistently ranks as one of the world's best employers. 2. Apple Apple's brand value nudged up by 3% to $235 billion, helping it retain the No. 2 position in the ranking. But the brand has lost some shine since 2015 when it topped the BrandZ ranking. Wang said Apple's "innovation speed over the last year is not perceived to be as fast as Google or Amazon." BrandZ's ranking relies heavily on consumer perceptions. If people can't see that Apple is being innovative, its brand value will suffer. 3. Microsoft Microsoft has landed in the third slot for three years running. It's brand valuation nudged up by 5% to $143 billion. "The key word is Microsoft Cloud," said Wang, who said the success of the company's cloud and business services helped improve consumer perceptions. Microsoft generates nearly a third of its revenue and almost 40% of its operating profits from its "Intelligent Cloud" line of businesses. Investors are clearly happy with the company: Shares have shot up by about 16% since the start of the year. 4. Amazon Amazon has been on fire over the past year and its brand value surged by 41% to hit $139 billion. "Wherever the consumers go, Amazon is going," said Wang. "At this moment, that is the right strategy." The retail giant offers a wide range of services: online shopping, grocery delivery, cloud computing and entertainment are just the tip of the iceberg. It's continuing to develop artificial intelligence services and its personal digital assistant, Alexa. Investors have taken notice too, bidding up shares by 34% since the start of the year. 5. Facebook The Facebook brand continues to perform well, despite scandals over fake news and violent events streamed live on its platform. Users think of Facebook as "friendly" and "helpful," said Wang. This has helped convince advertisers to move onto the platform, and users don't seem to mind the growth in advertised content, she said. Facebook's brand value shot up by 27% over the past year to hit $130 billion. 6. AT&T Telecom giant AT&T has appeared in the ranking for seven consecutive years and its brand has increased in value by 65% over that period. It's now worth $115 billion. "It's becoming a more dynamic brand and increasing communications with consumers," said Wang. The company is trying to close an acquisition of CNN's parent company, Time Warner, that is worth about $109 billion including debt. If the purchase goes ahead, it would be one of the biggest takeovers of all time. 7. Visa Visa is an American company with a name that's recognized around the world. The company's brand value increased 10% to hit $111 billion this year. The brand got a particularly big boost after Costco ended its relationship with American Express last year in favor of a new one with Visa and Citigroup. Millions of former Costco AmEx cards were subsequently transferred to Visa and Citi. 8. Tencent Led by its media-shy CEO, "Pony" Ma Huateng, Tencent is huge in China, where its messaging platform WeChat is used for everything from texting to booking karaoke sessions. BrandZ said that increased used of WeChat helped to propel Tencent into the top 10 for the first time. Its brand value jumped 27% to $108 billion. The only other Chinese firm to have cracked the top 10 is China Mobile, but it's hasn't appeared on the list since 2013. Tencent is hoping to avoid that same fate by expanding globally. It announced plans last month to set up an artificial intelligence research lab in Seattle. "Right now they're very aggressive in going beyond China," said Wang. 9. IBM IBM has been included in the ranking since it started in 2006. This year the brand has been valued at $102 billion, up 18% from last year. The company has helped boost its consumer appeal through the development of the artificial intelligence mascot Watson. "Watson is the face of the company's transformation," said Wang. 10. McDonald's McDonald's is the only truly non-tech company to be featured in the top 10 ranking this year. The brand has received a boost by introducing more healthy food options. It's also offering more locally-inspired options in places like China and India, said Wang. "McDonald's has been doing pretty well compared to the other fast food restaurants," she said.

By Emily Bary and Nicholas Jasinski June 5, 2017 5:29 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple's $349 HomePod speaker comes out in December. Photo: Apple Apple has finally made its much-anticipated entrance into the smart home speaker market with the “HomePod,” announced Monday afternoon at WWDC. Given how much hype the device got from the rumor mill before its reveal, Apple nerds (and investors) might be disappointed by its high price tag and lack of revolutionary new features. HomePod is a 7-inch tall Apple-engineered wireless speaker with a large woofer and seven smaller speakers. The $349 WiFi-connected unit includes six microphones and the same chip that powers your iPhone. You can use voice controls to turn on lights, set timers, play music, and handle your usual Siri commands. Apple’s not the first to come out with a voice-controlled speaker, and its device costs more than the two big players combined; the HomePod will sell for $349, while the Amazon Echo costs $180 and the Google Home goes for $130. Essentially Apple is betting that its ecosystem is worth twice Amazon’s or Google’s. Apple tried to justify the HomePod's steep price tag in its WWDC keynote. Photo: Apple Apple has a history of introducing devices with high price points and still managing to outsell the competition, but such a premium over other smart home speakers might be hard to justify -- especially given the Alexa-powered Echo’s head start. An industry report earlier this year estimated that the Echo would make up 70% of the voice-controlled speaker market by year end. (The report didn’t take into account the possibility of an Apple speaker, but the Home Pod won’t be out until December anyway.) Apple’s PR machine is already working overtime to convince consumers that the HomePod is worth the money. “It takes the listening experience to a whole new level,” reads a quintessentially Apple description of the new product. “And that’s just the beginning.” Besides a more-advanced speaker, the HomePod doesn’t seem to have any features that its competitors haven’t had for months. Siri is touted as a big selling point for the device, but it has plenty of room for improvement. Marketing agency Stone Temple recently asked Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana each the same 5,000 general knowledge questions and rated their replies for accuracy. Google Assistant and Cortana each got more than half right, while Siri and Alexa barely answered more than 20% correctly. At least Amazon already has its device in millions of homes. The HomePod won’t even be out until the end of the year. Overall, Apple’s announcements at WWDC didn’t wow investors. Shares dropped 1% on Monday after an analyst downgrade. And Wall Street isn’t sold on the HomePod’s potential. “Given the price point relative to competitive offerings, we would expect the near-term impact from HomePod to be immaterial,” Piper Jaffray’s Michael Olson wrote in a note to clients.

Apple is getting serious about competing with Amazon’s and Google’s infiltration of the home. At the company’s annual developer conference on Monday, Apple announced a new Wi-Fi speaker called HomePod that will play music and respond to voice commands with Apple’s digital assistant, Siri. HomePod will be released in December for $349, and it's meant to work with Apple's $10-per-month subscription music service, Apple Music. HomePod marks Apple’s attempt to put a stake in the smart-home assistant hardware market, an area currently dominated by Amazon’s growing array of Alexa-running devices, like its Echo speaker, and Google’s Home gadget, which runs Google Assistant.

Incorrect email format Manage your newsletter preferences HomePod doesn’t have a display, but when you say “Hey Siri” to invoke Apple’s assistant, the top of the device lights up. It can do things Siri already does, like deliver weather, traffic, or sports updates. You can also use it to relay voice commands to smart appliances that use Apple’s smart-home software, HomeKit (these include a range of smart bulbs, thermostats, and so on, but excludes Google-owned Nest’s smart thermostat). In many ways, Apple kicked off the mass-market digital personal assistant trend in 2011 with the release of Siri for the iPhone, then considered novel for its abilities to respond to commands to make phone calls, check the weather, or set up an appointment (though its ability to understand queries was sometimes comically bad). Siri was originally developed at SRI International as part of a DARPA-funded artificial intelligence project called CALO (Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes) and spun out as a startup; Apple purchased it in 2010. Apple has lagged behind Google and Amazon, however, in incorporating Siri into a voice-operated household device, and it was widely expected to start selling its own. After all, the market for such devices is growing fast, and projected to keep expanding: in a report this month, research firm eMarketer predicted nearly 36 million Americans will use a speaker-based voice-assistant each month this year, more than twice as many as a year ago. About 71 percent of them will be using Amazon’s Echo speaker, while Google’s Home captures about 24 percent of the market. This overall adoption is still tiny compared to, say, the number of people using smartphones every month, but is growing faster. Yet even as Apple showed off HomePod—which it saved for last during the more than two-hour presentation—the company seemed to deliberately undersell the device as an all-around home assistant. Instead, it positioned the product as a more of a smart speaker that is wedded to Apple Music and happens to also have other capabilities thanks to its Siri integration.  Recommended for You First Quantum-Secured Blockchain Technology Tested in Moscow The Desktop of the Future Is Coming Experts Predict When Artificial Intelligence Will Exceed Human Performance Google Sprinkles AI on Its Spreadsheets to Automate Away Some Office Work Secret Algorithms Threaten the Rule of Law First, there’s the name, HomePod, which hearkens back to Apple’s iPod—a device that has always been focused almost exclusively on tunes. “Just like we did with portable music, we want to reinvent home music,” CEO Tim Cook said. Second, when Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of marketing, came back to the stage to present the device, he spent much of his time highlighting how well it plays music—explaining the minutiae of its built-in tweeters and woofer. He also singled out its ability to figure out the acoustics of the room it’s in, and optimize the sound accordingly. Finally, when talking about its ability to use Siri, he explained most in depth how the assistant can help with a range of music-related HomePod commands like “Play something more mellow” or questions like “Who’s playing drums on this track?” These types of music-related capabilities are limited to Apple Music subscribers, though; if you don't want to pay a monthly fee, Siri won't be able to help you here.  Get stories like this before anyone else with First Look.

I’m curious about tech innovation, and I’m always on the lookout for the next big thing. Before… More arriving at MIT Technology Review in early 2012, I spent five years as a technology reporter at the Associated Press, covering companies including Apple, Amazon, and eBay, and penning reviews. I’ve also worked as a freelancer, covering both technology and crime for the New York Times. I grew up mostly in Palo Alto, California, where companies like Hewlett-Packard and Google were simply a part of everyday life. But I didn’t discover my love for tech coverage until 2003. That’s when I accidentally discovered a major security lapse in Palo Alto Unified School District’s wireless network, which allowed anyone with Wi-Fi to view sensitive student information, including psychological profiles identified with full names. When not hard at work on a MIT Technology Review story, I can be found cycling around the Bay Area. READ COMMENTS Please read our commenting guidelines.

Apple unveiled new hardware, including a Siri-powered speaker, and previewed upcoming iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch features as the company's Worldwide Developers Conference kicked off Monday. Here are the highlights: ___ SIRI-POWERED SPEAKER An internet-connected speaker called HomePod is coming in December for about $350. The speaker is similar to cheaper devices from Amazon and Google. Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research, says the price is good for a high-end audio device. Besides playing music, Apple's Siri digital assistant will also respond to requests for information and other help around the house. ___ A NEW, SMARTER SIRI With an upcoming software update for iPhones and iPads, Siri will learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay using Apple Pay. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Siri, meanwhile, is getting a new voice. Or make that new voices, with a male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. And Apple Watch is bringing Siri front and centre. The smartwatch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. ___ ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY Apple says its Safari browser on the Mac will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. Another Safari feature will stop video from automatically playing on websites. The features are part of the Mac software update this fall, to be called High Sierra. The current version is just Sierra. As for HomePod, Apple says that while the speaker's always listening, nothing will be sent to Apple's servers until you say, "Hey, Siri." The protection is similar to what Google Home and Amazon's Echo speakers already offer. Even then, Apple says it won't know who you are — it'll just get an anonymous ID to help process a response. ___ A DIFFERENT REALITY Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Although Apple is late to the game, CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says the new tools come "as the technology hits an inflection point." Apple's new iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities, which Apple says makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. So far, interest in VR has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change that. ___ NEW HARDWARE Apple is introducing a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. That size offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. The new iPad starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also unveiled new Macs, addressing complaints that Apple has let its Mac lineup languish in favour of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. New iMacs and MacBook laptops start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro coming in December starting at about $5,000. ___ UPDATES FOR THE IPHONE AND IPAD With the next version of the iOS system for mobile devices, messages will sync in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage space. For photos, Apple is replacing JPEGs with a new format meant to reduce file sizes. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple will also have new tools for organizing photos and creating sharable videos. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay someone back through its payment service, Apple Pay, much as PayPal and other services already do. Before, Apple Pay transactions could be done only with businesses and institutions. Apple Maps will get lane guidance for highways and floor plans for indoor malls and airports. Google Maps already does both. And Apple will have a new "do not disturb" mode for driving. The phone will block most notifications to reduce temptations behind the wheel. The free software, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business Apple Inc.

New updates to the itslearning learning management system (LMS) will make it even easier for K-12 teachers to assess and grade their students during the 2017-18 school year. Among the LMS’ enhancements is a streamlined grading workflow, a new capacity for annotating student submissions online and the ability to easily see students’ assignment status, to search and share assessment activities, and to deliver tests and see grades on any device. “Our goal is to provide the best integrated grading and assessment experience for teachers and students, alike,” said Arne Bergby, CEO of itslearning. “For students, we know the importance of staying connected to their results and outcomes of school work. So now we’ve made it a one-stop shop where they’ll be able to check their grades from any device they choose. For teachers, we were determined to make it easier to complete their assessment and grading tasks so they can spend more time teaching.” The updated grade book features enhanced data entry and it provides greater ease of use on mobile devices such as tablets. When an assignment or task deadline passes without a submittal from a student, that individual entry in the grade book will automatically become shaded red so teachers can see what’s overdue at a glance. itslearning will also allow teachers to use their browser to annotate student submissions in common file types such as MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint as well as Google Sheets, Google Docs and Google Slides. This new annotation capability will simplify the feedback process, allowing for detailed and personalized feedback. The LMS’ new assignment tool will be the fastest and easiest way to submit, view and grade student work. It will allow students to submit assignments via a cloud service such as Google Drive or OneDrive, which means that they will be able to submit an assignment, or even take a test, on any device of their choosing. The tool also will enable teachers to quickly and easily see which students have or have not completed assigned work. In addition, teachers will be able to search and share assignments, tests and third party assessments via the itslearning library. Educators can even search for assessments by standards. A new, shareable and easy-to-use test tool will allow students to take assessments on all devices and screen sizes. “Teachers can let students take a test on their phone in class and immediately see the results so they’ll know whether they need to spend some additional instruction time against the subject matter and when they can safely move on,” said Bergby. The added assessment and grading features are just the latest enhancements itslearning has announced. In April, the company introduced market-leading integrations to the world’s most popular cloud apps giving users the ability to work in Excel, Word and PowerPoint directly from within itslearning, without the need for a Microsoft email account or for any user information to be shared with Microsoft. In May, the LMS enhanced its mobile app, giving K-12 students and their teachers the full LMS experience even when they’re on the go. District administrators, teachers and students are now able to access course content, resources and tools on their Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. Additionally, students can use the app to submit assignments and attach files.

The retail giant has continued to focus on its technology ecosystem honed to meet multiple consumer needs such as online shopping, rapid delivery and entertainment, as well as introducing new artificial intelligence-enabled services including grocery delivery and personal assistant Alexa.  Google, Apple and Microsoft retain the top three positions, growing their brand value +7% to $245.6bn, +3% to $234.7bn and +18% to $143.2bn respectively over the past year, while Facebook, at no. 5, grew +27% to $129.8bn. 25% of the total value of the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands is made up of the combined brand value of the Top 5, emphasising their dominant positions in the modern business landscape.  David Roth, CEO EMEA and Asia, The Store WPP, says: "This year's BrandZ global top 100 continues to demonstrate that strong brands deliver superior shareholder value and returns regardless of disruptive external climates. Dubbed the 'The Frightful Five' by some, the tech giants that head the rankings are more like the 'Fearsome Five' to their competitors, given their huge brand power and a seemingly unassailable market position." Other highlights in this year's ranking include Chinese brand Tencent (no.8), which saw increased use of its social platform WeChat and entered the Top 10 for the first time, with a brand value increase of +27% to $108.3bn. Adidas was the fastest riser by percentage growth (+58%, $8.3bn), followed by Chinese premium alcohol brand Moutai (+48%, $17bn).  As the largest and definitive brand-building platform in the world, BrandZ reflects the brands that are integrated into today's consumer lifestyles. It is the only brand valuation study to combine interviews with over three million consumers globally with analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel). This year, the total brand value of the Top 100 brands has risen +8% to $3.64 trillion, compared with +3% in 2016, while the number of brands worth more than $100bn has increased from six to nine. The total brand value of the ranking is up +152% from 2006 (its first year), as its composition has shifted towards innovative, consumer-focused technology brands with huge reach and brand-building power. The BrandZ Top 10 in 2017 are worth almost as much as the entire Top 100 in 2006 ($1.42tn vs $1.44tn), and have grown +249% in value, compared with +152% for the Top 100 as a whole.  The value of the BrandZ Top 100 Global Brands confirms that strong brands continue to outperform their competitors. Compared against key benchmarks over the past 12 years, the portfolio of BrandZ Top 100 brands grew 50% more in value than the S&P 500 and 3.5 times the MSCI All Country World Index. The 2017 ranking shows that the balance of power has truly tipped towards the consumer-focused technology brands that develop ecosystems that cater to many needs, simplifying an increasingly complex world. More than half of the Top 100's total brand value is contributed by technology-related brands (a definition that includes telecoms and online retailers), up from a third in 2006, and these have grown +16% in the last year compared with +4% for non-tech brands. Nine of the Top 10 are technology-related brands, as are all seven of the newcomers to the Top 100 in 2017: XFinity, YouTube, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Salesforce, Netflix, Snapchat and Sprint. Retail was the fastest rising category, increasing +14% in value over the last 12 months, driven by ecommerce brands such as Amazon and Alibaba which, like many native internet companies, continued to add physical stores to their sales channels. Overall the value growth of pure online retailers has increased +388% since 2006, while traditional retailers dropped -23% as they took longer to adapt their offering to include online. The technology category grew +13%, while fast food was this year's third highest growing category (+7%), as the leading brands introduced fresh food and value menus as well as customer touchpoints innovations that enhance the brand experience.

 In terms of regions, US brands dominate the ranking, with 54 brands in the BrandZ Top 100, worth 71% of the total brand value. In the last year these brands have grown +12% compared with an overall -1% decline for brands with origins in the rest of the world except China where overall brand growth, excluding state-owned enterprises, was +11%. The top 20 B2B brands increased their value by 11%. Microsoft remains at no. 1 growing +10% to $143.2bn, while Shell is the fastest B2B riser, increasing +23% to $18.3bn. The ranking also shows that as the digital world creates overlap between business and consumer environments, the border between B2B and B2C is disappearing, creating B2H (Business to Human) brands. Key trends highlighted in this year's BrandZ Global Top 100 study include: Consumer-centric technology ecosystems are making brands indispensable. Consumers can increasingly carry out a variety of activities, from online shopping to watching television, under the banner of one brand and across multiple devices. This convenience for consumers also allows the most powerful brands to minimise the risk of consumer switching. New brands are increasingly born global, allowing them to grow rapidly. Technology allows businesses to provide their offerings globally from day one. This is fostering a new breed of entrepreneur, who is not restricted by the geographical or sector boundaries that have traditionally limited the speed and scale of growth. Traditional non-tech brands are adopting technology to innovate and increase consumer appeal . Fastest riser Adidas has introduced 3D printing to produce its footwear, for example, while fast food brand Domino ' s Pizza offers customers a real-time tracker for their order. The BrandZ Top 100 is getting younger. The average age of a brand is now 67 years, compared with 84 years in 2006, reflecting the entry of the newer technology brands and the emergence of brand China. Brands that make it clear how they will make consumers ' lives better , such as Huawei and Toyota, have grown three times more on average over the last 12 years (the top third grew +170% compared to the bottom third which was +57%). Great communications puts a brand at an advantage. The top third in terms of strongest communications (including McDonald's and L'Oréal Paris) have grown 196% in value, compared with 47% for the bottom third. This is because they have successfully amplified the difference they have built. Doreen Wang, Kantar Millward Brown's Global Head of BrandZ, comments: "This is the era of internet giants that have developed ever-growing ecosystems that touch and connect consumers, with the overall aim of making life easier, simpler and better. Technology with the consumer at its centre has redefined our expectations, and we now take for granted that products, services, tools and content are immediately available at our fingertips. These brands also demonstrate great elasticity - they confidently and comfortably play in new territories and new categories to develop and expand their customer bases."

About the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands Ranking  Carried out by WPP's marketing and brand consultancy Kantar Millward Brown, the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking is now in its twelfth year. It is the only study to combine measures of brand equity based on interviews with over three million consumers globally about thousands of global 'consumer facing' and business-to-business brands with a rigorous analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel) to separate the value that brand plays in driving business and shareholder value. Consumer perception of a brand is a key input in determining brand value because brands are a combination of business performance, product delivery, clarity of positioning, and leadership. The ranking takes into account regional variations since, even for truly global brands, measures of brand contribution might differ substantially across countries.

Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple “can’t afford to yield valuable real estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smartphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple’s annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality “experiences.” But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple’s entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple’s web browser, seeks to make users’ online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn’t be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser’s new “intelligent tracking prevention,” meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7-inch model couldn’t, yet isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple is updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It has enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch.

But Indian tech news site Gadgets360 reports that Amazon may take another crack at smartphone hardware. So how would the company’s new phone or phones be different? If the first was Fire, the new models are “Ice.” Seriously, that’s allegedly the code name. It’s best to take the report with a grain of salt though. Amazon hasn’t officially confirmed any plans, and the new Ice phone strategy is very different from the one Amazon uses to sell tablets, Kindles, TV boxes, and other hardware… although there are also some reasons the Amazon Ice phone concept sounds plausible. Amazon Fire Phone Amazon sells Kindles, Fire Tablets, and other hardware at reasonably low prices in order to get customers hooked into the Amazon ecosystem. Have a Kindle? You’re more likely to buy eBooks from Amazon. Have a Fire TV? Then it’d almost be silly for you not to sign up for Amazon Prime to stream movies, TV shows, and music. So it’s no surprise that the original Fire Phone shipped with Fire OS, a custom build of Android that also runs on Amazon’s Fire tablets. But without access to services such as Google Maps, Google Assistant (or its predecessor, Voice Search), and other apps and features that users might expect, the Fire Phone was a tough sell. More recently, Amazon has taken a different approach to the smartphone space: in the US, the company has partnered with smartphone makers including Motorola, BLU, and Alcatel to offer “Prime Exclusive” variants of some phones. When you buy one of these special edition smartphones you save $50 off the list price… and get a device with lock screen ads and a suite of Amazon apps pre-installed. That approach gets Amazon’s apps and services in front of users, without requiring a huge investment on hardware. And users arguably get the best of both worlds, since the phones also feature Google’s apps, services, and the Google Play Store. So… what does this all have to do with the alleged Amazon Ice phone? According to Gadgets360, instead of partnering with third-party phone makers in India and other developing markets, Amazon seems to be developing its own low-cost phone. That sort of makes sense. There are already some dirt-cheap phones made for developing markets. Some are distinctly better than others though, and there’s certainly still an opportunity for Amazon (or any other company) to make a name for itself by offering a high-quality budget phone that offers a better user experience than you’d expect in that price range. Markets where people don’t already have a lot of brand loyalty to long-time phone makers might also seem appealing. So while it’s unlikely that Amazon would try to sell a branded phone in the US or other developed markets after the failure of the Fire Phone, it wouldn’t be surprising to see some first-party hardware from the company in emerging markets, offering the same kind of Google + Amazon software experience we already see on Prime Exclusive phones in the US.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. I think Amazon’s path is pretty easy actually. Offer pay-as-you-go without unnecessary minute purchases. Typically MVNOs make their profit by forcing people to update their phone every 30 to 90 days regardless of whether they need more minutes or not. Amazon could offer unlimited time frames for Prime members. I know for my father that would make Amazon Prime a no-brainer. Like many elderly people he likes to have the cell phone but doesn’t use it that much. He has to update regularly though to keep it active so he has like a few thousand minutes he will never use. And it costs him about $80/year to do that. Getting Amazon Prime instead and updating only when he needs minutes would not cost him much more and he’d get the other Prime benefits. As with most Prime gimmies, Amazon would make their money due to the fact that Prime members… Read more » Vote Up1Vote Down  Reply 2 days 22 hours ago Guest riddick Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

For anyone who handled the thing, it’s a sturdy device, quick as heck vs. most Android phones at the time with most that you’d want or need at your fingertips. You didn’t NEED Google services, really, as there are plenty alternatives out there. Personally I feel the phone failed because of the exclusivity deal with ATT. Apple can manage to do exclusivity deals because they already have a huge, loyal fanbase. Google got away with it with the Pixel phones because they weren’t truly exclusive, they were just sold hand-to-hand through Verizon. Anyone could still buy them through/from Google directly, unlocked. The Fire phone was only offered, locked to ATT’s network. I feel that a phone offered by/through Amazon should be unlocked and either available through all carriers or just through Amazon. Whether it comes with Google services or not… Read more » Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 1 day 23 hours ago Guest Peter Lowe Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

If they still can’t figure out how to sell 7 inch Fire tablets in Canada, I don’t know how the heck they think they can sell a phone in China or Brazil.

provided by Kantar Millward Brown 06 Jun, 2017, 00:01 BST Share this article LONDON, June 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The technology giants Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook take the Top 5 places in the 2017 BrandZTM Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking released today by WPP and Kantar Millward Brown.      (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/513554/Kantar_Millward_Brown_Logo.jpg ) Amazon achieved the highest dollar value growth of all brands in the Top 100 ranking, increasing by $40.3 billion (+41%) to $139.3bn to take the no. 4 position. The retail giant has continued to focus on its technology ecosystem honed to meet multiple consumer needs such as online shopping, rapid delivery and entertainment, as well as introducing new artificial intelligence-enabled services including grocery delivery and personal assistant Alexa.  Google, Apple and Microsoft retain the top three positions, growing their brand value +7% to $245.6bn, +3% to $234.7bn and +18% to $143.2bn respectively over the past year, while Facebook, at no. 5, grew +27% to $129.8bn. 25% of the total value of the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands is made up of the combined brand value of the Top 5, emphasising their dominant positions in the modern business landscape.  David Roth, CEO EMEA and Asia, The Store WPP, says: "This year's BrandZ global top 100 continues to demonstrate that strong brands deliver superior shareholder value and returns regardless of disruptive external climates. Dubbed the 'The Frightful Five' by some, the tech giants that head the rankings are more like the 'Fearsome Five' to their competitors, given their huge brand power and a seemingly unassailable market position." Other highlights in this year's ranking include Chinese brand Tencent (no.8), which saw increased use of its social platform WeChat and entered the Top 10 for the first time, with a brand value increase of +27% to $108.3bn. Adidas was the fastest riser by percentage growth (+58%, $8.3bn), followed by Chinese premium alcohol brand Moutai (+48%, $17bn).  As the largest and definitive brand-building platform in the world, BrandZ reflects the brands that are integrated into today's consumer lifestyles. It is the only brand valuation study to combine interviews with over three million consumers globally with analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel). This year, the total brand value of the Top 100 brands has risen +8% to $3.64 trillion, compared with +3% in 2016, while the number of brands worth more than $100bn has increased from six to nine. The total brand value of the ranking is up +152% from 2006 (its first year), as its composition has shifted towards innovative, consumer-focused technology brands with huge reach and brand-building power. The BrandZ Top 10 in 2017 are worth almost as much as the entire Top 100 in 2006 ($1.42tn vs $1.44tn), and have grown +249% in value, compared with +152% for the Top 100 as a whole.  The value of the BrandZ Top 100 Global Brands confirms that strong brands continue to outperform their competitors. Compared against key benchmarks over the past 12 years, the portfolio of BrandZ Top 100 brands grew 50% more in value than the S&P 500 and 3.5 times the MSCI All Country World Index. The 2017 ranking shows that the balance of power has truly tipped towards the consumer-focused technology brands that develop ecosystems that cater to many needs, simplifying an increasingly complex world. More than half of the Top 100's total brand value is contributed by technology-related brands (a definition that includes telecoms and online retailers), up from a third in 2006, and these have grown +16% in the last year compared with +4% for non-tech brands. Nine of the Top 10 are technology-related brands, as are all seven of the newcomers to the Top 100 in 2017: XFinity, YouTube, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Salesforce, Netflix, Snapchat and Sprint. Retail was the fastest rising category, increasing +14% in value over the last 12 months, driven by ecommerce brands such as Amazon and Alibaba which, like many native internet companies, continued to add physical stores to their sales channels. Overall the value growth of pure online retailers has increased +388% since 2006, while traditional retailers dropped -23% as they took longer to adapt their offering to include online. The technology category grew +13%, while fast food was this year's third highest growing category (+7%), as the leading brands introduced fresh food and value menus as well as customer touchpoints innovations that enhance the brand experience.

 In terms of regions, US brands dominate the ranking, with 54 brands in the BrandZ Top 100, worth 71% of the total brand value. In the last year these brands have grown +12% compared with an overall -1% decline for brands with origins in the rest of the world except China where overall brand growth, excluding state-owned enterprises, was +11%. The top 20 B2B brands increased their value by 11%. Microsoft remains at no. 1 growing +10% to $143.2bn, while Shell is the fastest B2B riser, increasing +23% to $18.3bn. The ranking also shows that as the digital world creates overlap between business and consumer environments, the border between B2B and B2C is disappearing, creating B2H (Business to Human) brands. Key trends highlighted in this year's BrandZ Global Top 100 study include: Consumer-centric technology ecosystems are making brands indispensable. Consumers can increasingly carry out a variety of activities, from online shopping to watching television, under the banner of one brand and across multiple devices. This convenience for consumers also allows the most powerful brands to minimise the risk of consumer switching. New brands are increasingly born global, allowing them to grow rapidly. Technology allows businesses to provide their offerings globally from day one. This is fostering a new breed of entrepreneur, who is not restricted by the geographical or sector boundaries that have traditionally limited the speed and scale of growth. Traditional non-tech brands are adopting technology to innovate and increase consumer appeal. Fastest riser Adidas has introduced 3D printing to produce its footwear, for example, while fast food brand Domino's Pizza offers customers a real-time tracker for their order. The BrandZ Top 100 is getting younger. The average age of a brand is now 67 years, compared with 84 years in 2006, reflecting the entry of the newer technology brands and the emergence of brand China. Brands that make it clear how they will make consumers' lives better, such as Huawei and Toyota, have grown three times more on average over the last 12 years (the top third grew +170% compared to the bottom third which was +57%). Great communications puts a brand at an advantage. The top third in terms of strongest communications (including McDonald's and L'Oréal Paris) have grown 196% in value, compared with 47% for the bottom third. This is because they have successfully amplified the difference they have built. Doreen Wang, Kantar Millward Brown's Global Head of BrandZ, comments: "This is the era of internet giants that have developed ever-growing ecosystems that touch and connect consumers, with the overall aim of making life easier, simpler and better. Technology with the consumer at its centre has redefined our expectations, and we now take for granted that products, services, tools and content are immediately available at our fingertips. These brands also demonstrate great elasticity - they confidently and comfortably play in new territories and new categories to develop and expand their customer bases."

About the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands Ranking  Carried out by WPP's marketing and brand consultancy Kantar Millward Brown, the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking is now in its twelfth year. It is the only study to combine measures of brand equity based on interviews with over three million consumers globally about thousands of global 'consumer facing' and business-to-business brands with a rigorous analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel) to separate the value that brand plays in driving business and shareholder value. Consumer perception of a brand is a key input in determining brand value because brands are a combination of business performance, product delivery, clarity of positioning, and leadership. The ranking takes into account regional variations since, even for truly global brands, measures of brand contribution might differ substantially across countries.

(KTRK) AP Monday, June 05, 2017 05:57PM Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The "HomePod" speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. SIZING UP THE IPAD Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera - the same one found in the iPhone 7 - along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Report a typo to the ABC13 staff Report a Typo Related Topics: technologyappleapple watchiPad Email share share tweet email (Copyright ©2017 by The Associated Press.

(Apple) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn & Mike Murphy June 05, 2017 Apple’s annual developer conference felt especially like a show for consumers this year, with announcements of seven laptop updates, a new iMac Pro desktop computer, a new iPad, and a new home smart speaker called the HomePod. But Apple also had something for developers: new versions of operating systems for the iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Apple computers, which will be available to consumers this Fall. Augmented reality, a theme of recent Google I/O and Facebook F8 developer conferences, also made an appearance on the San Jose stage. Apple spent significant time talking and demoing its ARKit, a set of tools for developers to use the iPhone and iPad camera lenses to overlay digital objects on the world, like in the popular mobile game Pokémon Go. However, the coming changes announced today that might be most important to users are things Apple didn’t talk talk about. Based on a presentation slide shown onstage but not discussed by company reps, the new iOS 11 will bring a slew of little changes meant to make life easier, like a one-handed keyboard for little thumbs reaching across gargantuan screens, and easier wi-fi sharing. Here’s a rundown of all the news. HomePod The HomePod, with Siri. (Apple) Apple unveiled its answer to the Amazon Echo and the Google Home: a squat, 7-inch speaker called the HomePod. The fabric-covered smart speaker can do pretty much everything an Echo or Home can do, from controlling internet-of-things devices, to playing music, providing updates on your calendar, and answering general questions. You control it by talking to Siri, Apple’s digital assistant (who isn’t known for consistently providing the most reliable of responses). The HomePod features seven tweeters and a 4-inch woofer that Apple suggests will provide sound that will “rock the house.” The device comes in black or white, and will be available in December for $349—or about $200 more than Amazon and Google’s costliest speaker models, for roughly the same functionality. New iPads For a while now, Apple has been trying to convince us that, for the average person, the iPad is a worthy replacement for a laptop. After today’s announcements, that may finally be true. Apple debuted a new version of its massive 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and a new 10.5-inch model with smaller bezels. Both feature brighter screens and faster processors. But what really sets them apart is the new software they’ll come with: iOS 11, the next iteration of Apple’s mobile operating system, expected to launch in the autumn. Apple’s new 12.9-inch iPad Pro running the forthcoming iOS 11 software. (Quartz/Mike Murphy) A new app called Files gives iPad users access to all the files on their device in one place, so you can actually find photos to attach to a tweet, or a spreadsheet to add to an email. You can even drag and drop files right from one window to another, just like you would on a computer. You can float apps as windows from the iPad’s dock, or have them in split-screen, giving the iPad the feel of something you might actually be able to put into a bag and feel confident taking with you instead of a laptop—assuming you purchase an Apple Pencil and keyboard case to go with it, of course. The new iPads start at $649 (for the 10.5-inch) and $799 (for the 12.9-inch), and are available today. Apple expects them to start shipping next week. iMac Pro There’s a new Mac in town. Apple previewed the iMac Pro, a new version of its iMac desktop that only comes in its “space grey” color. Other than its more aggressive coloring, it also features some powerful innards: It can hold up to a 4 TB solid-state hard drive, 128 GB of memory, as well as run two 5K monitors and two RAID data storage arrays at once. The iMac has its own 27-inch 5K screen and a new cooling system that Apple says can run 80% cooler than its other iMacs, allowing it to run far more efficiently. The super-powered iMac Pro starts at $4,999, and will be available in December. Making sure the iMac Pro looks just right. (Quartz/Mike Murphy) New Macs and MacBooks On top of the new iMac Pro, Apple refreshed just about its entire line of Macs today. The MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops received new processors, featuring Intel’s new “Kaby Lake” processors, with speeds up to 3.5 GHz. Its non-Pro iMacs also got some upgrades: New iMacs will also feature Intel’s new processors, as well as faster hard drives, new graphics cards, brighter screens, and a new Thunderbolt 3 port. Both the iMacs, the new MacBook, and MacBook Pros will all start at $1,299, and are available today. Apple also revived its long-sidelined MacBook Air, upgrading it to a slightly more powerful 1.8 GHz processor. But the Air still doesn’t have a HD Retina display—like every other Mac computer. VR on Macs One of the more surprising announcements at the convention was that Apple is now working to support virtual reality systems on its computers. Onstage, a team from Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), the special-effects arm of Lucasfilm (the company behind Star Wars), showed a demonstration of Darth Vader roving around a lava planet breathing dramatically while surveying some destroyed starships, running on an iMac through an HTC Vive VR headset connect. A video showed an ILM employee walking through the Star Wars planet as Darth Vader walked by her. After the keynote, journalists could try out the Vader demo, as well as a few games from the HTC Vive library. The experience felt no different than it did playing on a Windows computer. Apple even had VR headsets connected up to MacBook Pro laptops, which however did require an external graphics card to power the VR experience. There's actual demos of the HTC Vive running on Macs and I thought it was as neat as the Windows experience is #WWDC2017 pic.twitter.com/KqIyWv4qIu — Mike Murphy (@mcwm) June 5, 2017 While these demonstrations were just proofs of concept of what Apple systems could do with VR, they do suggest Apple is taking the medium more seriously and that more could be in store—especially when one considers that the primary audience of today’s keynote was the myriad developers who build games and apps for the company’s existing platforms. iOS The annual iOS update is here. (Apple) Perhaps the most impactful announcements Apple made today concerned iOS, its mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads. Rather than redesigning the entire experience, Apple decided to change specific pieces of the software and add new features into existing platforms like iMessage and Siri. iPhone owners will now be able to use Apple Pay to transfer money between each other, much like the popular Venmo app. Of course, because Apple Pay requires a phone made by Apple, you won’t be able to easily send money to your friends who have a Google Pixel, which might still give Venmo an edge. Swiping up from the bottom of the iPhone screen will reveal a new Control Center, the bevy of buttons used to manipulate things like wireless connectivity, screen brightness, and music. The new Control Center is all on one screen, rather than a series of pages that the user swipes through. There is also a dedicated button for turning cellular signal on and off, great for the times when you don’t want to lose signal to Bluetooth headphones, like on an airplane. Best of all, it’s finally customizable, so you can create your shortcuts in your own image. Siri, Apple’s virtual personal assistant, wasn’t neglected either. Apple says Siri will be in even more places on the phone, reading iMessages and browsing history to help predict when you want to see information, create events, or even type certain words. Siri can also now translate English to Chinese, French, German, and a few other languages. You’ll also be able to type messages to Siri—instead of just talking to it—making it so much more than just a voice assistant. On the iPad, iOS 11 will bring an entirely new app switcher and bottom dock (like the one on traditional Mac laptops), as well as a new file explorer app. Called Files (nice), the app attempts to turn the iPad into a viable work machine; trying to put files in a folder or work with a few files at once on an iPad was previously a Sisyphean task. It’s not really a iOS feature per se, but Apple is also redesigning its entire App Store for the first time since its creation. A new “Today” tab will emphasize recently released apps, and there’s a dedicated section for games. Then, as mentioned earlier, the final iOS 11 presentation slide revealed a slew of other features not discussed by Apple execs onstage—but that will significantly change the iPhone and iPad experience for most users. To name a few: There’s now one-handed typing, where holding down the emoji key on the virtual keyboard brings all the keys closer to your preferred thumb, making it easier to tap out messages while holding a coffee or crying baby. There’s also a new way to set up your iOS device: Just hold it near one of your old ones, and a new setup process will automatically import data from that device’s iCloud. macOS High Sierra MacOS has a new name: High Sierra. Apple made a significant tweak under the hood, changing the way files are constructed and stored into a different proprietary format. This will likely speed up some operations like copying files, but doesn’t really mean much for the average user. It will probably still be a nightmare to transfer large files between Mac and Windows environments. Other than the new file system, nothing groundbreaking is happening on MacOS. watchOS 4 Smarter notifications. (Apple) Is the fourth time the charm for the Apple Watch? Since the device launched in April 2015, Apple’s premiere wearable has had three complete iterations on its operating system. They just can’t seem to get it right. But that’s okay, because nobody really has—smartwatch software is generally terrible. Apple is trying a slightly different approach this time, with a Siri-backed watch face. Based on a variety of factors, like the time of day, amount exercised, and location, Siri will suggest information that you might want to see. Given Apple’s past problems with slow load times on the Watch, we’ll have to see whether this feature is quick enough to be actually useful. Other faces added include a kaleidoscope and Toy Story characters for some reason. The Workouts app is being overhauled for easier use, and Apple has partnered with gym equipment manufacturers so Watches can sync with them for better health data. But unless your gym changes its equipment every year on an Apple hardware cycle, you probably shouldn’t get too hyped about using this feature in coming months. Apple TV Amazon Prime Video is coming to Apple TV, and that’s about all Apple had to say about its streaming device. AR Kit Augmented reality is Silicon Valley’s buzzword du jour, dragged into the public eye by the insane popularity of Pokemon Go last year. If you’re not familiar, here’s the basic idea: you use your phone (or tablet) camera as an oracle to glimpse into a world where digital objects are laid over reality. A digital dog pees on your rug, but there is no stain afterwards. A cup of tea sits on your table but you cannot drink it. The idea is interesting, but in practice it feels silly to move around a tiny glass window in order to peek into a massive digital world that doesn’t do all that much. Following the trend— at Google’s I/O keynote the company also gave developers a group of augmented reality tools—Apple released AR Kit, tools for developers to build AR experiences for iOS devices. Where will iOS developers decide to put place digital teacups? That’s for us to find out, and personally we cannot wait.

I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Barron Roth Yes, I've got 500k in Google Photos and it can be unbearably slow. makapav 55K and no it's not slow for me on my Pixel XL or Chrome on Windows. Danyel Gustavo I currently have 5k photos from my phone uploaded. I was thinking about uploading all my 15k photos taken with my camera. Alvar Lagerlof That will be no problem Michael Zinfandel Rork Not in the slightest. Hardly any of those are on my phone, and when on the web it's purely cloud based so it only loads what you are looking at. There is absolutely no lag from having more images in Google Photos. Level380 at 55k its not slow at all, searching is still fast. yippiedad Nope, I haven't noticed any lag.

Lexxior what happens if you do? dcdttu It uploads pictures. Jorim Tielemans 78,533 photo's, that's only 3 times the amount of my bookmarks 🤐 maybe that would be a cool poll for next weekend. Lexxior wtf 20000+ bookmarks?! Wis Zero. makapav My condolences. matteventu 1543. I'm not a big shooter. But I don't understand how they count "Albums"... I'm sure I don't have 464 albums lol (just 4-5 actually). Antoine Martin Every link you share creates a hidden album nagi 71,234... yes, I shoot a lot. Nathaniel V Stupid question. Why is the album count so high? I think I've only got about 40 albums. Ruddock's looks the same... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b938bcf21775e44a09d96b5f066996b5222174f26d73027381a6cbf127a6ce8.png Sean It probably includes the auto-generated "this day x years ago" albums and such Lars Jeppesen Also I think it includes "shared" stuff makapav All those Hangouts albums from Picasaweb in the background that are probably hidden in Google Photos. Morten Ulv Yep, this is the correct answer. You could see them in Picasaweb. One for each day. Tomáš Petrík I have almost that many albums with less than half the photos. Bryan Mine says 577 albums, but if i click the arrow to expand it, it only shows 3 (which is correct) Hexlattice Yeah, it makes a shared album every time you share even just one photo with a person... Kinda why I prefer sharing a photo via Hangouts or some other means. I don't like the clutter it makes in my albums. senor_heisenberg Under a thousand. whispy_snippet 11,049 Dominic Labbé Well.... 99042... 😮 Got my first digital camera in December 1999.

Corey Kinard Here, have a 🍪 Phil Miller Do you hide them under your mattress? BigTurk 97,222 :O Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher I don't have Photos listed! But I estimate around 250,000-300,000 photos. Makes Photos on my phone practically unsuable, somehow Google Photos insists keeping all thumbnails in internal memory which takes up 2-3GB of space. Photos uses up all the battery of my phone if I enable the app :-( dsDoan All of my photos are synced with Google Photos, but I don't take many photos, so it's under 1,000. Jason Brian Chapa 35,445 Maxr1998 Only slightly above 2500 pictures, that's​ everything I took in the last five years. I don't take many pictures, but that's also because I'm very selective with my images - I remove most "duplicates"/alternative photos which aren't that good and only keep the best images. Bryan How does the album count work? I've only made 3 albums but it says i have 577 albums. App Shah 65K + https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4077abf057824ff03b40189ea40058cc9fdea8e6160c0bcbde23fbeaaac30a52.png Martins Nkem I've got over 2200 photos mostly photos from my picasa album and photos i uploaded to Google drive about 3 years ago. I prefer not to use cloud storage for photos any more. Richard Markert Under 100, lol. Try under 10. I don't use Photos. VAVAMk_2 Over 1700...I need to take more photos I guess. Laurentiu 27,809 SchmilK EnHaggen Just under 200,000 photos over here. Took 6 days to upload my entire photo library via desktop app. Everything I've shot with my DSLR and phones over the past 13 years. Phil Miller 42 photos a day? Do you even have time to sleep? SchmilK EnHaggen I shoot a lot of bursts, plus it's a mix of me, my wife, and my 2 kids phones all synching to the same account (granted the oldest is only 7, but she has been know to take 42 pictures of a TV show lol) Vasilj Milošević 52.832 photos 3.784 albums :D Image upload bugs for me on disqus, so here's imgur link: http://imgur.com/a/qY6gw Jeffrey Heesch Only 7,770 for the time being, but I just recently got myself a DSLR, so I'm expecting my Google storage to hurt in the near future. Mr Wright 64,616 all nudes 😎 Dmitry Stepanushkin about 30000. Nudes will stay on local storage 😁 cadtek91 I don't think the Album counts are accurate. Lord Argyris 2,925 here. Everything since I got my Nexus 7 on December 31st, 2013, which is when I officially joined the Android ecosystem. I'm curious, where is the Sites statistic some people have posted? I can't seem to find that anywhere on my account dashboard. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f18afe5301756a2f37e6f449c2faf0ec975cf47ead995985d6cf0ee4cb56fe1c.png tapsboy 10,351 JG 64,884... With another 1,940-some waiting to upload as I type (literally just got back from an extended data-light/less vacation where I was the unofficial group photographer). A lot of the pics (especially from this trip) are burst shots. Trying to photograph something as we drove by so I just let it go to get the most tree-less pic... Or to make an animation or panorama pic. That, and of course, cat pics :) Hey, if Google is going to give me free unlimited storage... Might as well take advantage. Bryan Kolb Just under 200,000... Dre 44,153 Kevin Sword "Wekeend" poll? Guess so! 9,179 photos. Phil Miller 19,268. For my 20k photo, it will be a pick of my friend Harry Johnson.

Is your porn collection included in that number? Kidding ;) Your comment about the service being slow is odd, it should only load what you're looking at and not everything. But perhaps something goes wrong when the number is so high. Barron Roth I'm a photographer, so it shouldn't be too unusual! It's slow mostly during search or scrolling through historical dates. uthark 107,383 Dlang123 Photos ‌124,910 tu3218 If I upload photos to google photos that wasn't taken on my phone, will they be analyzed and sorted correctly by their date, location ,etc. Assuming all this data is attached to the file.

HSidhu 000064 Photos :) Victor %01000000 David Zero smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245. I have it sync with my PC, and all my DSLR pics get uploaded Justin Osborne 15k, but probably half of those just since I got the Pixel, due to our first baby. Over 20GBs of HQ pics/video since then. Michael Zinfandel Rork 70,503 Level380 55K and counting. Leandro Brandão 10132. I backed up some old photos and used the photo scan app to scan others, maybe 100 or 200 photos. I use google photos since my first android phone in 2012, i was amazed how that worked back then, now is even better. Joshua Talley Pretty sure I saw over 100k several months ago... codingismy11to7 17k, in original quality... and I've recently been thinking about uploading my 90+ GBs of stuff from before gphotos existed... Willie Chalmers III I am definitely in the minority with only 2,140 photos. What do you people take pictures of? b_boogey_xl I've got like 25k photos but if I remember correctly, this isn't just Google Photos but any photo you have uploaded to Google across their many services, including Hangouts, Google+ Messager, Google Voice, Google+, Picasa, etc… I believe if you go to your About Me page you can see all the "albums" and photos you've ever uploaded to those Google services (not including Google Photos). Mike in KC 457. Guess I'm not much of a photographer... Saqib What is maximum free storage allowed with Google photos? tehboogieman They say unlimited for compressed images Miku is Best Vocaloid 10000 and counting Joshua Worth 83,689 😊 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ef968361c0424a651500b83acdd44d4fa19466201c00685b3a584e99d0e40e77.jpg Sherrie B 297,771 Daniel Rodriguez Looks like I've taken a picture or two in my time... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/505b72e38a4d6a15ced01c270253dc58d8777887f0c273491675ea1e322be65e.png Morten Ulv Jesus. What are all those photos of? You take hundreds of photos every day? I take maybe 10 000 per year of my kids, so that's a modest average of ~30 per day. Andrew Bone ~95% selfies 😉 Daniel Rodriguez Oh god, not if I can help it. No one needs to see that much of me. abc He takes a pic of every meal he's ever eaten. Daniel Rodriguez .. guilty as charged. Daniel Rodriguez Hah, actually, I'm definitely an edge case with an unusual situation: I have a little 'lifecam' thing that takes pictures every 30 seconds that I use when traveling around, so it generates thousands and thousands of pictures when using it. The company that makes it recently went under, and so the service they offered where they hosted the pics it took went down- I downloaded my pics before it went down, and uploaded them to Google Photos, all in the Unlimited storage when letting Google compress them (which is fine, the vast majority aren't high quality anyway). So far, no issues with it, Google claims unlimited storage when you use their compression, and, numbers above showing, they mean it. create812 Google is in an intense meeting now, discussing how to handle "whales" like you. Daniel Rodriguez Hey, they promise unlimited storage if using their 'high quality' compression, I'm just taking them up on the offer! Francisco Peña they gonna throttle you from taking any more pictures. Daniel Rodriguez I'm actually curious if they will, I upload tens of thousands at a time when I travel thanks to my lifecam, and so far haven't run into any issues or gotten any alerts. I tell the client to upload them using the Google 'high quality' compression, for which they offer unlimited storage if you use it, and so far, they've been as good as their word. Definitely not doing anything that's against terms of service, all falls within the service's promised offer, so if they did throttle me, I'd love to know why. There's a big difference between 'unlimited' and 'unlimited as long as you don't go over 50,000 photos' or something like that. Artem Russakovskii Around 35k for me. Dennis 64.498 - ich speichere mittlerweile ausschließlich dort.. ast00 3342. I guess I don't take many pictures. Roderick Gadellaa Somehow Photos doesn't show up for me in that list. It's supposed to be above Play Music, right? It shows Payments there for me. Weird? vwnut13 I'd have more, but they are in a "brand account" attached to my Gmail. Still accessable online, but no longer in the Android app. Thanks for breaking, then removing that feature Google. Trent 25,525 it was very low prior to getting my Nexus 5X when that and Local Guides launched. The Pixel has raised it somewhat, but getting my DSLR and traveling fairly often (only 8 countries so far this year, but about that many again planned up until December) to take pictures and backing up my RAW files along with JPEGs has made a big difference. Peter World Citizen I love cats. I've just over 5k of photos of pussies. Plus another 2k of food and cars/bikes. Jan-Lk Else Where's the no option? Javier180 Simply dont vote.

I did upload everything I have, including older ones I scanned and our Family archive (going back to 1960) Wilson I'm running out of storage :O Victor 4982 albums and 246688 photos. Everything since 1996 on my Amiga till now, where every picture received or taken with the phone gets automatically baked up. Erik 41000 for now. I hope AI will improve so I can find what I'm looking for. It would be nice not to get pictures of cats when I search for dogs, buses and cameras when I search for cars and picture frames when I search for computers for example. Oh, and face recognition is still not available in Europe. I guess Google doesn't want to upset EU more than they already have. Rob I have face recognition in Europe. Not sure how I did, but it's fairly easy to activate it. I think by a single-time usage of VPN and reset app data. Have had it ever since. Alenekbell Google is paying 97$ per hour!

James 53,235 so far. I have had a hard drive failure and if it wasn't for them being backed up, theses photo s would have been lost. sasu85 Backup in Google compressed resolution or at full resolution? Do you have also other backup (like hard drive?) Or not? James It just so happens that my pics are 12mp or less and I believe that is the restriction that Google has set. Many of my pictures are scanned pictures from old photos and every smart phone I owned (I always had them backed up). I do have them on my hard drive, but have actually been rethinking this as I see no benefit from having on my hard drive. Just 440. Removed all after switching from Nexus 5 to Pixel, and will do so after switching from my Pixel to something else. mcored Photos ‌66,423 Tom Daley settings say 7700 same folder on my server says 20000+ Hmmmm not sure whats happening there Timothy Vreeland 38k, so close to moving up in the poll bracket.

I really do not take many photos, most of what I do take is used for online sales or confirmation photos, so they get deleted after the transaction. Another large number is having info from hardware at work so I can enter it into a database when I get back to my desk. Again those get deleted once that data is entered. Alfonso Surroca 8K, and that's including the fact that I synced like 15 years of photographs from my desktop computer to my Photos account. abc This is more of a "how many photos do you take" question than a Google Photo question. benmarvin 16,405. And I don't even take that many pictures. Some of my photos go all the way back to Picasa days Indefinite Implosion Yep 15,608 and a lot are from before I had a smartphone/from my DSLR when I had a smartphone. Brandon I've got just over 5k, which is less than many people here but is pretty much every photo I've taken in the last 12-ish years. I try to remember to back up to my external hard drive now and again just in case, but otherwise Google is the only thing I use for photo storage, management, or editing. James Miller My wife takes pictures of our 5 boys daily with our DSLR. Whenever I put them on our NAS drive, I have them automatically backed up using the desktop backup client.

Kostas 💪🎩 Any way to put photos to a special place separate from the others, that aren't in your face all the time? Abhimanyu Seth Just 44,672 photos till now! philopek each as he likes but then i think the question is not very specific hence the answer doesn't provide much else than a sheer number. if the question had been "self made and unique images" that would have provided a more useful picture. while there certainly are photographers, selfie addicts and the likes, i know how many years it takes to produce a few 10'000 images of notworthy quality and uniqueness because i'm producing photos for the last 45 years now, all digitalized and stored safely, and at the times the pace of production was insanely high and still one gets' nowhere near some of the numbers that have bee mentioned here. further what are all the folks doing once google will drop a platform entirely. i remember that i have changed platform due to changes made by apple and/or google which is why all my images are now structred in simple folders and subfolders, storable and managable on every computer cross platform, no matter what some may decide. when apple changed from iphoto to photos for example most features were missing and to continue watching the library on apple-tv one had to purchase software without knowing whether it would meet requirements etc. i would like to know how many of those images are self-made and more or less unique, everything else is just claiming bragging rights IMO Ozl yeah, i will triple my photos and videos by the end of the year when i get the New Pixel Phone xD (hoping it still has that unlimited upload) Chris Foote 139,750.

Pro tip: Put Google Photos on your computer. If you're on vacation and you have Wi-Fi at the hotel, but Google Photos on your laptop. When you check in at the hotel, plug your phone up and copy/move all the photos over. Let it back them up while you're out and about. myssi Wondering how much it costs to Google to save all these bazillions of photos; that too for an app which earns $0. Leroy Filon 132.068 photos.

Rosh Mathew This is for people who have 40,000 photos synced. Do you ever get the feeling that - OK IM KINDA GETTING TIRED OF SNAPPING AWAY DURING A VACATION THAN ACTUALLY ENJOYING the moment? Years later, that foggy feeling that I spent so much time taking photos that I don't remember the vacation at all? And when you do have some time to sit down and reminisce, going through thousands of snaps feels exhausting, and there is too much emphasis on quantity of snaps than QUALITY? (I used to snap away 30+ pics a day on average, now cut it down to 5-6, keeping the phone away during events to actually enjoy the moment) Horacio Gómez 66.333 photos.

Amazon may launch 'Ice' smartphones in India running Android with Google services Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 11:17am PDTJun 5, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 Amazon News Rumors Amazon famously misread the market when it launched the Fire Phone in 2014 without any Google apps. Scarcely a year later Amazon had abandoned the device in the face of minuscule sales figures. Now, it's rumored to be prepping a new smartphone, but unlike the Fire Phone, this one will apparently run a version of Android with Google services. The report claims Amazon will brand these new phones as "Ice," and they will ship with Android 7.1.1. That means they'll have Google Assistant out of the box. Alexa support isn't as clear, but I'd be shocked if Amazon didn't add that. The Ice phone will also have the Play Store and all the apps that come with it. The first of these phones might launch in India by the end of the year, perhaps as a trial before shipping the phone in other markets. This would be an inexpensive phone with modest specs including a 5.2-5.5-inch screen, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, a 13MP camera, and a Snapdragon 435. Amazon is currently planning on a price of Rs 6,000 (roughly $93), but that could change by the time it launches. Well, if it launches.

Bruce Wayne From Fire to Ice. Not so subtle. Daniel 'Cause when Amazon made their last phone, all they did was get burned. XD NexusKoolaid And what did they do with all those unsold Fire phones they had stockpiled? They put 'em on ice. Daniel And what a bummer for them; they really had a burning desire to sell a bunch of them NexusKoolaid But in the end, they just decided to chill out. Daniel Bet you don't get these kind of comments on other websites. lol 4Ui812 She's sun and rain , She's fire and ice , a little crazy but it's nice , and when she gets mad best to leave her alone Daniel "You leave my wife outta this" -Jeff Bezos talking about his phone Lord Argyris Maybe they just like Pokemon? I expect they'll chain as many types that are super effective on the next in line as possible. Expect Flying, Bug and Psychic phones in the coming years. Or Dragon, Dragon, Dragon... MJ Here we go again... At least Amazon figured out it needs to have the Play Store. Pessimippopotamus Has anyone tried to make an E-Ink phone before aside from Yota? I feel like a smartphone that lasts several days with a b&w but very efficient screen would be right up Amazon's alley, especially considering its Kindle lineup, instead of a me-too low-end device. Marty Every e-ink device I've ever used was painfully slow. Unless e-ink can refresh at LCD rates, I don't see it being used as the primary display. Pessimippopotamus This is true. I feel like there's a bigger potential market in it as opposed to something like say... ...a phone with a 4-camera 3D system. 4Ui812 Amazon is taking a page from Microsoft. But I'm telling you ... don't discount MS. That beast is slowly waking up. Marty Agreed. MS will eventually finally have the world's best smartphone...long after the industry and the market has moved onto other things. 😋 4Ui812 No. Microsoft is moving back into software. Hardware was never their forte nor their bread and butter. T4rd I actually thought the opposite; their hardware is pretty solid IMO, esp. their newer tablets and laptops. In the mobile arena, software is definitely what's holding them (and other OEMs from using their software) back. Đức Thành Yup, their hardware isn't something I'd complain about as much as I'd complain about the software. There are times I'd just like to swear at my Windows 10 PC while I'd very seldom do that if at all to my precious Chromebook. T4rd Seems like they're still on their way to sleep right now.. https://seekingalpha.com/news/3271314-microsoft-rolled-os-update-bricked-windows-phones. I'm sure MS will return at some point; if anyone has the resources to brute force the mobile market (again), it's MS. But yeah.. it's going to be a while still.

Jason King How can Amazon sell both a device with Google Services and their Fire tablets? I thought Google Services was all-in-one? MJ It's a PHONE that will have Android and Google services on it. What's the confusion? Google Services agreements are per device... Jason King In the past, members of the Open Handset Alliance were prohibited from making any non-Google approved devices (ie: forked) from a company level, not a device level. It's why Acer had to pull out of the alternate Android OS that Alibaba created called Aliyum a few years ago, but that may have changed more recently. Amazon Fire was determined to be a 'fork' of Android which leads me to believe Google wouldn't allow Google Play Services on any Amazon device. MadMartigan That requirement is placed upon members of the OHA. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to get a device GMS licensed. Therefore, Amazon can do it. Acer cannot. Jason King ahhh - that's the difference then. Thanks for the clarification. Roger Siegenthaler What's the source of that information? Because Google would probably love to know seeing as this exact problem is the basis of their massive monopoly lawsuit in the EU. MadMartigan First: The basis for the EU lawsuit is that OEMs cannot sell Google Play Store compatible devices without Chrome, Google Search, and all the other GMS core apps installed. GMS licensing requires all GMS core apps be installed. Some oems would like to ship devices with Google Play store, but without the core GMS apps. Second: My source is common knowledge and deductive reasoning. Cyanogen, Inc was not a member of the OHA. Xiaomi is not a member of the OHA. Both sell (or sold) GMS devices. Xiaomi also sells non-GMS devices. Conclusions: You can sell GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Cyanogen, Inc.). You can sell non-GMS devices and GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Xiaomi). You can not sell devices with an incompatible fork of Android while a member of the OHA (Acer). Roger Siegenthaler ok; first point is wrong. That's only part of the lawsuit. And your only example that proves you to be correct is false as Xiaomi can only sell non-GMS devices within China; famously exempt from the GMS rules for ALL OEMs. RedPandaAlex Wait... don't they need to join the open handset alliance in order to do this? And doesn't that prohibit them from putting out devices without Google (like the Kindles)? MJ You are the second person who has said this... Where is this coming from? Samsung puts out phone(s) with Tizen on it. Stephen Sharp You can't put out what Google calls an "incompatible fork". This is how they put a stop to Aliyun Labrat Furthermore, if you sell one phone with an "incompatible fork" you can't sell any phone with Google Apps, at least, AFAIK. MadMartigan ...if you are a a member of the OHA. MJ What other phone does Amazon sell? YaKillaCJ They sell tablets and I wonder if the Fire Stick lineup could also violate. Im just curious whats the rules and stipulations. MadMartigan You cannot do this if you are a member of the OHA. If you are not a member, you can have your own Android and GMS Android. The OHA is what forbids that practice. Cael Tizen isn't a fork of Android. MJ Amazon Fire OS is... Rohan Tizen is a different OS while Acer and other using Alyun OS was a fork of android. The former is OK. Otherwise, companies like Samsung, LG would've had to stoop making laptops. MJ I guess you didn't read the whole discussion as someone else had the answer which is NOT your reasoning... Acer and Alyun were part of the Open Handset Alliance while Amazon is NOT. Why are you talking about laptops? LOL MadMartigan No. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to be GMS licensed. In fact, being a member of the OHA would expressly forbid them from doing this. Remember: Acer could not put out their non-GMS device because they were a member of the OHA, which is the body that forbids that sort of thing. vn33 Are they going to write a song about Fire and Ice then?? chromaniac It's going to be hard to compete against the likes of Xiaomi and Lenovo here in India. Flipkart tried and gave up. Micromax is still trying to make a comeback. Hrishikesh Bisen No it's not. At that price point and brand name of Amazon. chromaniac lol ok? MadMartigan Hey Ryan, The OHA/GMS issue seems to be confusing a lot of folks. Any chance AP could do a write up explaining this so people more clearly understand the differences/similarities? Kendall Seabury A phone of fire and ice. Designed by George R. R. Martin. Alvin Samsung's version of the fire phone was a little too literal. Andrew Bone Now just let us cast Amazon video 😉 Đức Thành I guess that one incident with the Fire Phone was enough to make Amazon reconsider its life choices and decide that it was time to grow up. Still, that was a long break that it took. The naming scheme is not bad but still kind of funny. Paul Monroe, Jr. Now if they could just do that with the fire tablets they might actually have something going on..

[Deal Alert] Get a $75 credit when spending $750 or more on a Pixel with Google Store Financing Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 8:04am PDTJun 5, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 27 Share on Facebook 25 Share on Twitter Total Shares62 Deals Google Pixel Pixel XL The Pixel is a great phone, but it's not sold by most carriers. Google make it a little easier to afford this device by making financing available. It's rare that Google discounts devices on the Google Store, but you can get $75 off a Pixel right now if you use financing. There are some caveats, but not as many as most carrier deals. The deal requires you to spend at least $750—the Pixel XL would certainly fulfill that, but a 128GB regular Pixel should work too. Hey, or you could just buy a few Pixels. Your call. Just sign up for Google Store Financing and keep your account in good standing. After two billing cycles, you'll get an account credit for $75. This deal also entitles you to the free Pixel case, which Google started a week or two ago. The Pixel is getting a bit old, and maybe you shouldn't hop on that train anymore. Still, this is a good deal. Source: Google Store Tags deals Google google store pixel pixel xl subscribe ...

I'll stick to the essentials Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Watch out, Spigen might sue you! Aaron With the LCD display, lack of waterproofing and ugly screen mounted selfie can, I'm really not seeing any essential for me. Rawhi Mohammad Good points.. to be honest, I'm looking forward to the uglycam, waterproofing yes, that would have been nice. LCD.. that might suck, I'm used to my AMOLED. But it won't hurt to try it out and see for myself. Aaron Hey I'm definitely not angry about another premium vendor on the market. And there's a lot to be excited about here. But about like the first gen Pixels, I was hoping for a little more. Rawhi Mohammad Definitely agree.. they could've justified it's price by tackling all these points. Wonder if anyone ever will BinaryTB Maybe if it was a Pixel C, who knows if Google will announce another tablet, so might as well get the only pure Android tablet currently available. T4rd New battery definitely revived my 6P. Went from this with early shutdowns at 10-30%: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e2cf19817b113fda177a0371891906cc98537e17585ef51f9862d7c355c8837.png To this with 4-5 hours SoT again and no early shutdowns: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d935df6962acf507febc9d3ee4bb9a7deb1c8c5b91fe814c91768238d96f1966.png Edit: Opps, replied to wrong comment, hah. But I see Edgar replied anyways below. Edgar Martin Hope it fixes mine also. Two more days until I get a new battery. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4c60dbd62abb2ed4ae54165974d0fe71c8b31a84df4ffa732379c98e1a7b3d6a.png T4rd Damn, that's pretty bad. So does it really only last like 1 hour of SoT then? lol Edgar Martin If that. Lol. It's on the charger most of the time. ☹️ Jay That's really bad. 😮 Tom Z Here's how bad mine has gotten. I just purchased a Nexus 5x from Newegg to hold me over until the Pixel 2 arrives. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ebfe8d90329e8d0be031b0030b1000ba8c797240fb1238e0ce206802427b2b5a.png T4rd Wow.. you know Google is replacing 6Ps out of warranty because of this, right? Or you could have just got that $10 6P battery I posted below and had a local repair place put it in for you for much less than that 5X costs. Jason Pagliaro Mine went into the reboot loop of death this weekend, sadly. Battery was getting bad but no early shutdowns, at least. TheDrunkenClam Is it easy to do this replacement? Plombir It's not easy for sure plus you need tools as well. I will just get a battery and take my phone to a reputable shop to get it installed. asianrage Most likely, get a replacement back and glass and such. The chance of damaging that visor is very high. T4rd It's not hard IMO, but I've had a bit of experience repairing phones, tablets, and other electronics too and it does require some basic phone repair tools; heat gun/blow dryer, plastic wedges/guitar picks, super thin metal pry tool or x-acto knife, and a small screw driver. Most phone parts come with most of these tools (my battery from eBay did), but I've acquired many from past repairs I've done. I replace the battery in my previous One M8 too, which was considerably harder than this 6P since you had to completely disassemble the phone sans the display to get to it. Fortunately on the 6P, once you get the housing off, the battery is easy to get to and replace from there. The hardest part on this phone is removing the bottom plastic panel and top glass without damaging anything (much). So it's important to have a super thin knife or tool to pry these pieces out.. I had to make due with a box cutter blade and got it off with minimal damage to the housing. Anfronie I'm thinking of doing this soon. Where can I get an reputable OEM battery that is not a knockoff? I don't want to do all that work if the replacement battery is crap. Thanks for any info! T4rd I got this one: http://www.ebay.com/itm/252482757101?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT Looked EXACTLY like the original OEM battery and a few others in this Reddit thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/66tzgh/if_youre_on_the_fence_about_replacing_your/#bottom-comments) bought that one as well with the same results as I have had. You can see pics of it there too next to the original battery. Anfronie Thanks a ton for the info! :D John Doe Google sent me a 15% discount "just for you" off of the Pixel XL. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6f6e48720cee18cef32533cfd87278a84f7cb2d33eb3bdfa5289ad659e1c1908.png Good_Ole_Pinocchio You didn't use it did you? John Doe No of course not LoL Edgar Martin Hopefully getting the battery replaced in my Nexus 6P this Wednesday will allow me to hold off until the next Pixel is release... If not then Pixel XL it is. T4rd It's annoying that Google refuses to discount their Pixel devices. The Pixel C is now a major rip-off at $600 and almost 2 years old. Makes you wonder if or how much they'll discount the current Pixel phones when the new ones come out. I'm guess they'll take a generous $100 off their current prices, lol. Good_Ole_Pinocchio They won't... they'll just replace them with the New Pixel. T4rd Probably.. which would be for the best considering they still can't even keep stock of them now, let alone when they're superseded. Jason Pagliaro And use the remaining inventory for warranty replacements. Cael What inventory? Jason Pagliaro Everything except the 5" black seem to be in stock unless I'm missing something. Chris G Hope they bring the financing option to Canada this year with the pixel 2. exzacklyright Pixel 2 tho... Might as well wait JG Yeah... Too bad they probably won't let us open a financing account now and start paying ahead for the Pixel 2... Get the $75 credit in August... Have half (or a fourth, depending if you do 1 or 2yrs) of the Pixel 2 paid off by the time it's released... Would result in less of a sting to the check book, especially Taimen turns out to be a tablet, about time to replace my Nexus 9... me me oooh I so need to spend $750. Cowboydroid Sad, Google. Just sad. James Briano Boss to Johnson: "I want you to handle all the Pixel sales. ALL the Pixel sales!" Johnson to his broker: "Put all my money in Samsung. ALL my money." Badouken Just need my 6P to last til end of October for the Pixel 2 to release! atc-tech Lol... "DEAL!" yeah.... Bruce Wayne Lol. $750 on a Pixel. abc $750 for a year old phone that was overpriced to start with. Ridiculous. Testraindrop Deal Alert? Spending 750$ or more for a Pixel? Now? Why? There are so many alternatives. D.Smithee lol--$750 or more on a Pixel. Never gonna happen. WAY overpriced. Ray $1400+ here in a Australia for a 128gb XL. Absolute fraud I tell you. As much I would be willing to buy one now, it would need to be half that before I'd even consider it.

The data was collected during a 7-day period that ended on June 5, and it only represents devices that have visited the Google Play Store during that period, so to be clear, it does not include AOSP devices. Version Codename API Last month This month Change 2.3.3 - 2.3.7 Gingerbread 10 1.0% 0.8% -0.2 4.0.3 - 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich 15 0.8% 0.8% - 4.1.x Jelly Bean 16 3.2% 3.1% -0.1 4.2.x 17 4.6% 4.4% -0.2 4.3 18 1.3% 1.3% - 4.4 KitKat 19 18.8% 18.1% -0.7 5.0 Lollipop 21 8.7% 8.2% -0.5 5.1 22 23.3% 22.6% -0.7 6.0 Marshmallow 23 31.2% 31.2% - 7.0 Nougat 24 6.6% 8.9% 2.3 7.1 25 0.5% 0.6% 0.1 The biggest gain this month is obviously Android 7.0 Nougat, which got a 34.8% increase from last month to 8.9%. It's not exactly worth bragging about though, since it was released nearly ten months ago. But while Nougat is seeing strong momentum (as far as Android versions go), 7.1 is not. Nearly seven months old, it's still on only 0.6% of Google Play devices. Marshmallow saw its first decline (of just 0.1) back in April, and has remained stagnant at 31.2% since. The declines in Lollipop bring it down to a total of 30.8%, making this the first month where Marshmallow is more popular than the combination of 5.0 and 5.1. Jelly Bean and KitKat are continuing to decline steadily. Of course, this is normal for aging versions of the OS that used to have larger usage shares. Ice Cream Sandwich is stagnant, which isn't surprising given its already-low share. Gingerbread is continuing to bounce around the 1% mark, this time dropping to 0.8% after an increase last month.

It sits in your house, ready to do your bidding when you issue voice instructions. Google Home can answer questions, inform you about the weather, play music from Spotify, and much more besides. Canadians can now preorder Google’s smart home speaker from Google’s online store or Best Buy. Google itself is suggesting a vague release date of “2-3 weeks”. However, Best Buy suggests Google Home will arrive in Canadian stores on June 26. So we’ll assume that date is correct. Google Home will set Canadian buyers back $179 CAD. Which puts it on a par with the U.S, price. If you preorder, Best Buy will throw in a Chromecast for free. However, Google Home will also be available from Bell, Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Telus, Staples, The Source, and Walmart. Google Capitalizes on Amazon’s Laziness Google is taking an aggressive approach to getting Home in as many homes as possible.

WWDC is traditionally the place where Apple shows off improvements to the software that powers its devices, rather than hardware revisions or brand new machines. But with the company feeling pressure from rivals in the home computer and laptop spaces — and with many of its Mac lines having languished without significant updates for quite a while — many analysts were tipping an uncharacteristically hardware-heavy show, and that's exactly what we got.

Hello HomePod As expected, Apple is introducing a smart speaker to compete with Google's Home and Amazon's Echo. The HomePod, Apple says, is a wireless speaker that uses "spatial awareness" to adjust its output to the shape of its surroundings. Designed to pair with an iPhone and play music via a user's Apple Music subscription, the device will also field queries and control other smart home devices thanks to Siri integration. The speaker features an upward-facing woofer, seven tweeters each with dedicated amps and a six-microphone array. The HomePod will launch in Australia in December, although a price is yet to be announced. In the US it will cost $US349 ($466), more than twice the price of its Google competitor. Advertisement iMacs and MacBooks updated, Mac Pro re-imagined While whispers of a touch-enabled Mac line that would open the door to more versatile Apple machines turned out to be baseless, Apple is significantly updating several of its existing products with modern components, as well as introducing a new turbo-charged iMac. The iMac Pro blends the super-thin design of the standard Apple all-in-one with the bleeding-edge productivity focus of the old Mac Pro, packing enough power to handle high-end tasks like 3D modelling for VR. The increased power means Apple needed to craft a new kind of cooling mechanism to keep the components' temperatures lowered in the skinny enclosure. The dark grey computer sports a 27-inch, 5K display and will start at $US4999 ($6676) in the US. So far there is no word on international pricing, and no indication of what the most powerful iteration of the device — with 18-core Xeon processors, a Radeon Pro Vega GPU with 16GB of VRAM and a 4TB SSD hard drive — will cost. For regular folks who don't need a computer that can handle artificial intelligence research, the iMac, MacBook and MacBook Pro have all been brought up to date with new Intel Kaby Lake processors. The iMac now features Thunderbolt 3 ports and, in most models, dedicated graphics chips. At the low end there is still a 21.5-inch iMac with a 2.3GHz processor and a 1080p display, starting at $1599. More powerful 21.5-inch models with 4K screens start at $1899, and 27-inch models with 5K screens start at $2699. Meanwhile the 12-inch Macbook has faster hard drives and now supports up to 16GB of memory, while the 13-inch Pro has a new entry-level model that comes in at $1899. The 15-inch Pro, which starts at $3499, now comes with a more powerful AMD graphics chip with either 2GB or 4GB of memory. The new iMacs, MacBooks and MacBook Pros are all available for order now. iPad Pro gets a refresh Despite ever-shrinking sales, Apple announced a refresh for its line of high-end tablets. The iPad Pro now comes in an all-new 10.5-inch variation in addition to the original 12.9-inch size. The previously available 9.7-inch Pro appears to have been put out to pasture, presumably to avoid confusion with the standard non-Pro iPad, which is the same size. The 10.5-inch Pro has some impressively skinny bezels and weighs in at a tiny 469 grams. Both models feature an improved processor and something Apple calls "ProMotion", which essentially means the screens are now capable of higher refresh rates for smoother video and animations. The new iPad Pro starts at $979 and $1199 for the smaller and larger models respectively. The standard iPad and iPad Mini 4 remain unchanged. First look at iOS 11, MacOS High Sierra and WatchOS updates While the iPhone was largely absent from the announcements at WWDC, Apple did give a sneak peek into the future of the device with the unveiling of a new version of iOS, which also powers its iPads. New in iOS 11 will be a better camera app, a more capable Apple Pay system, a new version of Apple Maps with indoor mapping and a new toolkit to help developers bring augmented reality features to their apps. On iPad Pro, a redesigned app switcher and customisable dock gives the operating system a flatter, more modern look. The new software also contains a "Do Not Disturb While Driving" mode, which Apple says will help prevent iPhones distracting those behind the wheel, and a new "Files" app that resembles a traditional computer file system for viewing and organising documents. On the Mac front, Apple showed off High Sierra, the next version of MacOS. The update includes refinements to Photos and enhanced ad-blocking features for Safari. Most improvements will be under the hood, including an all-new file system, VR features and support for the new HEVC video standard. Finally, the company previewed some improvements coming to the Apple Watch. A new Siri watchface predicts what you'll want to see when you look at your wrist, while improvements to the device's fitness features will let you track new types of high-intensity workouts.

Instead get one of these best printers for Chromebook. Chromebooks are great for a lot of things, whether it’s writing a paper or browsing the web without worrying about getting infected with malware. But how do you know which is the best printer for Chromebook in 2017? Chromebooks, for all the things they do well, can also be notoriously fickle when it comes to drivers and recognizing third-party hardware without a heap of extra hair-pulling on the side. For our best of list, first and foremost we looked at printers that are known in the industry for being immediately compatible with Chromebooks using the Google Cloud Print service, as well as how quickly and quietly they can get your photos and documents printed out. All these factors in mind, the HP OfficeJet 200 Mobile is our #1 pick, not only for its performance, but also its extreme versatility and mobility options thanks to an onboard battery which keeps it chugging along even if there’s no power outlet to be seen. But there’s plenty more models in the running for the top spot, so make sure to read on in our guide to the best printers for Chromebook to find out who made the cut! Best Printer for Chromebook Comparison Chart   HP OfficeJet 200 Mobile Canon PIXMA MG7720 HP Envy 4520 Rank #1 - Editor's Choice #2 Pick #3 Pick Amazon Rating Printing Technology Inkjet Inkjet Inkjet Printing Speed (B&W/Color) 20ppm/19ppm 15ipm/10ipm 20ppm/16ppm Display Screen Scan Resolution N/A N/A 1200 dpi Borderless Printing? Dimensions 7.3 x 14.3 x 2.7 inches 14.6 x 17.2 x 5.9 inches 17.52 x 14.45 x 5.04 inches Weight 4.8 lbs 17.5 lbs 11.93 lbs Check Price Check Price Check Price How We Choose Because the list of printers that are actually compatible with Chromebooks is so small, it wasn’t too difficult of a task to find the best of the best from that short roster. On the whole, we wanted to keep the features and price point in line with what the average Chromebook user can understand and afford, so simplicity and low-cost were the primary focus when making our selections. The best printer for a Chromebook should at the very least have Google Cloud Print compatibility (to wirelessly connect to your laptop), as well as the option to print both in monochromatic and color without any major settings changes. Although the addition scanner would be nice, this extra functionality can sometimes add extra dollars to the final cost, something you want to avoid since Chromebooks are generally considered a budget laptop pick for buyers who are trying to watch their wallet (though the Canon still sports one at a decent price). Ultimately, we chose three printers that can either be plugged in/recognized by a Chromebook and connect wirelessly if you need it, while also printing quality pictures or text at high speeds. The best printers for Chromebooks offer combination of all these different features in a single package, and won’t cost you (or your budding college student) an arm and a leg to maintain over time. Who Should Buy a Chromebook Printer As more users wake up to the notion that you don’t only have to choose from a Windows or OSX machine to get work done on the road (or heaven forbid, Linux), Chrome OS is quickly becoming the alternative option for people who need a cheap, functional laptop that just does what you need it to every step of the way. Unfortunately, all that simplicity doesn’t always translate between other devices, printers especially so. Whether you’ve just bought your first Chromebook or have been using the platform since it was released, printing is something that all of us need to do at least once in awhile, if not every day. As paperless as things are nowadays, there are still plenty of tasks that require you to print something out on a physical page, which is why it’s important to find a printer that’s seamlessly compatible with your Chromebook or any other laptop/desktop in your house. #1 Pick HP OfficeJet 200 Mobile Printer/Editor’s Choice The HP OfficeJet 200 Mobile printer lets you print off your Chromebook from anywhere Price: $99 | Read Full Review: [EDIT: Posted later this week] Features: Onboard battery for mobile printing, 20ppm black/white printing, borderless printing WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The HP MobileJet OfficeJet 200 lets you take your Chromebook printing on the go thanks to its onboard battery.  The HP OfficeJet 200 Mobile Printer is one of the latest to join the company’s oldest and most widely recognized brands in the world of printers, updated with a slew of new features that brings printing into the 21st century. Wireless printing has been around for awhile now, but the HP OfficeJet 200 really lives up to its wireless/mobile name thanks to an onboard battery, which can be charged up so you don’t need to be near a plug in order to print out that emergency term paper or tax document from the road. In our testing, we found that on a full charge the OfficeJet was able to push out around 75 printed pages before running out of battery. This should be more than enough to satisfy any mobile professional or college student between plugins, especially when you consider those prints happened at speeds much faster than what you’d get from a competing printer that’s actually plugged into its own power source. The HP OfficeJet 200 is compatible both wirelessly as a part of Google’s Cloud-Ready network of printers, and also happens to be one of the few that Chrome OS has drivers for and can recognize upon being plugged directly into the USB port of a Chromebook (if you decide to go the wired-only route instead). The HP OfficeJet 200 may be the priciest option of the three, but it compensates for that cost by sporting the fastest and highest quality prints on this list, earning it the number one spot for the best printers for Chromebook in 2016. View on Amazon #2 Pick  Canon PIXMA MG7720 The Canon MG7720 is a wireless printing monster thanks to its compatibility with so many different platforms Price: $106.00 | Features: Five wireless printing connectivity choices, four color options WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Canon PIXMA MG7720 is a solid pick for multiple-OS households.  While the Canon PIXMA MG7720 may not be as mobile or immediately intuitive to the amateur Chromebook user as the OfficeJet 200, its low cost and extensive wireless compatibility options made it a must-have in our book. If you’re in a household that runs as many different platforms as there are separate devices, you might want to consider the MG7720 as your next printer. With the ability to connect via Air Print, Google Cloud Print, through NFC or even the Canon PRINT app from your phone, the MG7720 is the Swiss Army Knife of printers, connecting to Windows, OSX, or Chrome OS in seconds. Thanks to the onboard 3.5-inch touchscreen, all the necessary configuration to get these different systems working together in tandem can happen in the same place, removing the need to download separate drivers for separate machines depending on which machine you’re trying to print from at the time. Plus it also comes in an all-gold chassis, if showing off your printing skills is more your style. View on Amazon #3 Pick HP Envy 4520 Mobile Printer The HP Envy 420 is a cheaper Chromebook printing alternative to premium options like the OfficeJet 200 Price: $78.70 | Features: Google Cloud Print-ready, HP Instant Ink delivery, edge-to-edge printing WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: Edge-to-edge printing makes the Envy 4520 a perfect pick for photo-obsessed enthusiasts.  Like the Canon, the HP Envy 4520 comes with a number of different wireless connectivity formats to choose from, including Google Cloud Print. Unlike the Canon, however, the Envy is the only printer on this list that lets you print on both sides of a single page, saving you time and up to 50% on your next paper purchase! Cooler still, the Envy 4520 also comes equipped with HP’s proprietary HP Instant Ink system, which will automatically order new ink cartridges straight to your door whenever the printer detects it’s starting to run low. This means no more late-night trips to Staples, aimlessly wandering the aisles looking for the right cartridge so your kid can get their book report printed before tomorrow morning. It’s also one of the only printers at this price range (sub-$100) that gives you the option for edge-to-edge printing. This feature is perfect for photos, as it lets you print them out on the full stock without having to worry about trimming off the edges later. If you want a fast, cheap, and easy-to-operate photo printer for your Chromebook, look no further than the HP 4520. View on Amazon  Features to Look for in the Best Printer for Chomebook Google Cloud Print-ready: This is the big one. Since most Chromebooks don’t have the ability to recognize third-party drivers, Chrome OS instead uses what’s known as “Google Cloud Print” to connect the printer wirelessly to your laptop. You can check Google’s full list of compatible printers found here. Color printing: This may sound redundant, but not all printers in 2016 automatically come with color printing as a default. Be sure that you’re buying a printer that does the job you need it to, especially if you plan on printing lots of photos or presentations that need all the color they can get. Print speed: How fast a printer can push out the pages is registered on a metric known as “PPM”, or “pages per minute”. On average, you should look for a printer that can do at least 20ppm for black and white content, while the acceptable range for color printing starts around 16ppm. Mistakes to Avoid Buying monochromatic on accident: If you see a printer that’s Cloud-ready, has tons of extra features (scanner, fax, etc), and is also being offered up at a suspiciously low price – chances are you’re accidentally looking at a monochromatic printer, not color. Monochromatic printers are generally much cheaper than color printers, but also only print in black and white. If you don’t need your printer for anything except shipping labels or text documents this should be fine, but if you ever want to upgrade to printing photos or color pictures, you’ll have to buy a whole new unit instead. Skimping on ink quality: Look, no one likes spending half a house payment on ink cartridges every time they start to run dry, but the best way you can ensure you get every last drop out of your current cartridge is to spend on quality first. Certified cartridges from HP and Canon both last significantly longer than generic cartridges, and will always look better than generic when printing details in larger photos or illustrations. Which Best Printer for Chromebook Is Right For You? The best printer for Chromebooks may not necessarily be the best for every operating system, but it’s the kind of compatibility and flexibility you find in models like the HP OfficeJet Mobile 200 that really sets them apart. Overall these are cheap printers that can still print quality photos using Google’s Cloud Print platform, and don’t get tied up with overly-confusing configuration setups or six different ink cartridges designed to do ten different jobs. If you need something that’s great for students and road warriors, the OfficeJet 200 is the way to go. If you print a lot of photos from home, the HP Envy 4520 might be more up your alley, while the Canon MG7720 is a powerhouse that comes with a scanner and copier for just over $100 flat.

E.g., can’t use it with a Wifi hotspot. Can’t use it on someone else’s wifi that’s not set up for it. Which is completely ridiculous for a mobile laptop and portable printer. What good is that? So, there are some details about “Cloud Print” that aren’t mentioned, even in this article. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Elizabeth Dwoskin By Elizabeth Dwoskin June 5 Follow @lizzadwoskin Apple revealed a new smart speaker device, the HomePod, at WWDC. Here are some of its features. (Apple) SAN JOSE — In 2011, Apple became the first company to place artificial intelligence in the pockets of millions of consumers when it launched the voice assistant Siri on the iPhone. Six years later, the technology giant is struggling to find its voice in AI. Analysts say the question of whether Apple can succeed in building great artificial-intelligence products is as fundamental to the company’s next decade as the iPhone was to its previous one. But the tech giant faces a formidable dilemma because the nature of artificial intelligence pushes Apple far out of its comfort zone of sleekly designed hardware and services. AI programming demands a level of data collection and mining that is at odds with Apple’s rigorous approach to privacy, as well as its positioning as a company that doesn’t profile consumers. Moreover, Apple’s long-standing penchant for secrecy has made the company less desirable in the eyes of potential star recruits, who hail from the country’s top computer science departments and are attracted to companies that publish research. “Artificial intelligence is not in Apple’s DNA,” said venture capitalist and Apple analyst Gene Munster. “They understand that in the future, every company is going to become an AI company, and they are in a particularly tough spot.” At Apple’s annual developers conference Monday — the same event where Siri was introduced — the company's efforts to become an AI powerhouse were on display as executives launched a new stand-alone smart speaker and touted features meant to boost Siri’s chops and to power AI applications on Apple products. “Machine learning” — an AI buzzword that describes a form of ultra-fast, complex computer data analysis and statistical modeling — was repeated throughout the 2½-hour presentation, delivered to an audience of roughly 6,000 developers here. Siri will now use machine learning to predict the times of a morning commute, or scan the travel news as you are reading it on the company’s Safari browser and then suggest related activities, such as booking a reservation. She will use machine learning to talk with you and help you sort through music through a new $349 home automation device, the HomePod. She will automatically organize your photos into albums, such as “2nd Anniversary,” without you giving her any context about the pictures. There was even a new software tool kit, Core ML, that will allow for faster processing of large amounts of data collected during machine learning applications. (It’s six times as fast as Google’s rival AI processor, an executive quipped.) But Monday's announcements come as other technology companies have released similar innovations and have already spent billions on the burgeoning AI arms race. Many are placing their bets on artificial intelligence — software that one day may be smart enough to chat back and forth like a human, or computer vision that identifies real-world objects so well it can power the first fully functioning self-driving car. That has put Apple in the disadvantaged position of trying to lead in an area where it has fallen behind — and where the effort cuts against core aspects of the company’s secretive culture. “This is a substantial shift for Apple,” said Daniel Gross, a former Apple executive who focused on artificial intelligence. “The internal focus is on building great products, not publishing papers.” Ten years after launching the iPhone, Apple is on the hunt for another blockbuster product that can take its place. Sales of the iPhone propelled Apple to become the most valuable company in the world and still account for more than half of the company’s revenue, which was $215.6 billion in 2016. But last year, purchases of the company’s smartphone dropped for the first time, suggesting that the market for high-end smartphones may finally be saturated. “The difference between last year’s iPhone and this year’s iPhone is going to be much smaller than the difference between the first and second iterations of the iPhone. . . . So that S-curve is starting to flatten out,” said Benedict Evans, a mobile expert and partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, using an industry term for exponential increases in innovation. “Then you have the next transformative technology that isn’t here yet.” Apple did not respond to repeated requests for interviews and comment. Apple’s launch of he HomePod, which will go on sale later this year, comes several years after Amazon.com and Google released their own automation devices, the Echo and the Google Home, which send consumers’ spoken queries back to their servers in California for analysis. Google, Tesla, Uber, and others have been testing self-driving vehicles on public roadways for several years; Apple received its first permit to begin testing just two months ago. Before Monday’s updates, the Siri assistant was still mostly a glorified Web search that could tell the occasional preprogrammed joke. Now Apple is racing to catch up. Last October, the company hired Russ Salakhutdinov, a Carnegie Mellon professor whose expertise is in an area of artificial intelligence known as “deep” or “unsupervised” learning, a complex branch of machine learning in which computers are trained to replicate the way the brain’s neurons fire when they recognize objects or speech. Salakhutdinov is a protege of Geoffrey Hinton, perhaps the world’s top researcher in this area. Salakhutdinov divides his time between Carnegie Mellon and Apple. Hinton divides his time between Google and the University of Toronto. Building ties to academic superstars not only helps to improve products but also becomes a key recruiting tool, said Richard Zemel, director of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a professor specializing in machine learning at the University of Toronto. “You used to not see people with Apple name badges at conferences, and now you do,” Zemel said. In December, Apple presented and published its first academic paper on artificial intelligence at an industry conference. Another paper has been accepted to a computer vision conference and will be published in July, Salakhutdinov said in an interview. Salakhutdinov said he was not authorized to discuss his work at Apple in any detail. Zemel, who told Bloomberg two years ago that Apple was “off the scale” in terms of secrecy and that such secrecy was keeping it out of the loop on major developments in the field, now said that the Cupertino, Calif., giant was “making some changes.” “But it’s going to take some work,” he added. Researchers at elite universities said in interviews that Apple was still not the top choice for their computer science graduates — Google, Facebook and Amazon were by far the top picks — but that the company was moving up in the rankings. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Apple’s forays into AI have also been slower than its peers' because it’s been reluctant to embrace the data-mining practices of rivals Google and Facebook, experts said. The company has spent considerable resources building additional layers of privacy. Unlike Google and Facebook, which are primarily advertising companies that collect massive amounts of intimate data to profile their users, Apple believes in limiting the amount of user data it collects. At a previous developer’s conference, executives bragged that the company did not build user profiles. Chief executive Tim Cook has positioned the company as the anti-Google. But that stance against data collection becomes a problem if you are building artificial intelligence, researchers say. A home device must collect and analyze people’s speech to improve the way the device can speak to humans, for example. For Siri to be smart, she needs to collect and interpret data from other applications, such as your calendar, your restaurant reservations and, now, your browsing. Last year, as Apple began to embrace artificial intelligence on the iPhone, the company undertook a large privacy protection project. The project took an academic concept called differential privacy and applied it to AI applications on the iPhone. Differential privacy works by inserting noise — or bad information — into good data to confuse outsiders who might try to hone in on an individual's records. For example, in order for Apple software to group the photos of your dog into a single album, it needs to collect many photos of your dogs. Apple collects those images, but not before encrypting the data in them and then scrambling that data with other data, so that if anyone tried to recover the original data set they wouldn’t know what was tied to a single user, the company claims. This technique is considered a stronger privacy protection than other methods, such as using mathematical formulas to render user profiles anonymous. Apple’s focus on privacy may have slowed the company down in terms of building some products, Gross said, but the trade-off would be consumer trust. “Apple is dousing itself with an extra piece of really hard science and doing so to try and preserve your privacy,” he said. “I think Google and Facebook will have to answer to a world where a similar product that is offered is more privacy-preserving.” Munster pointed out that no tech company has a huge lead on artificial intelligence yet. “The bad news is that Apple is behind,” he said. “The good news is that if we look at how AI is going to impact the world, it’s still early days — there is plenty of time to catch up.” Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs introduced Siri eight years ago. It also misstated the first name of venture capitalist and Apple analyst Gene Munster.

Does it support multi-room audio? Does it work with Spotify? Show More Apple concluded its Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on Monday with a sneak peek of an all-new product: The HomePod.  Editor’s note: We’ve updated this story to include a full FAQ. Originally rumored to be called Siri Speaker, the HomePod is a smart speaker with Wi-Fi capabilities intended to compete against Amazon Echo devices and Google Home—although it will be significantly more expensive. During the WWDC keynote, Apple’s senior VP of marketing Phil Schiller boasted about the HomePod’s audio quality, its built-in room sensors, and the integration with Apple Music.  [ Further reading:The best home security cameras ] With its always-on voice assistant and ability to control connected devices, the HomePod is very similar to Echo devices and Google Home, but with a few notable differences. (We were able to get a closer look after the keynote, and you can check out our first eyes-on impressions here.) Here are the must-know HomePod features, specs, and sales info showcased during WWDC. Apple When’s the HomePod release date? The HomePod will be available for sale starting in December, initially in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia. So it’s will only support English-language voice commands during the initial rollout. It will then be available in other countries starting in 2018. How much will it cost? The HomePod costs $349 and will be available in two colors: white and space grey. By comparison, Amazon Echo is $180 and Google Home retails for $129. Is the HomePod just as smart as the iPhone? The HomePod comes with an A8 fusion chip, the same one that powers the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. That definitely puts it up at the top when it comes to “smart” speakers. Like the AirPods (which sport an A1 chip), setting up the HomePod is just as easy and intuitive. All you have to do is hold your iPhone next to the HomePod and it’ll be ready to start playing music in seconds. Apple How do you activate it? The HomePod has six microphones so that it can be activated verbally using the “Hey Siri” voice command. We’re not sure what happens if you have “Hey Siri” activated on your nearby iPhone as well. Hopefully, Apple implements a way for you to customize which device responds and fulfills the voice commands, or for the iPhone and the HomePod to communicate with each other and figure it out. We’ll let you know once we do our full review. What can you ask Siri to do? You can ask Siri to send a text message to your friend, start playing the latest episode of your favorite podcast, and get the latest updates in news, sports, traffic, and weather. You can also use voice commands to set alarms, timers, and reminders. In addition, Siri on the HomePod can help you answer some of your most burning questions like, “What’s the best Korean barbecue restaurant nearby?” or “Did the Warriors win last night?” Does it have a touchscreen? No, the HomePod does not have a touchscreen like the more-recent Amazon Show, but it can still responds to touch controls. You can tap the top of HomePod to play, pause, or adjust the volume. This panel also animates with an LED waveform to indicate whenever Siri is listening. Roman Loyola Can it control HomeKit devices? Yes! You can ask Siri to turn on the lights, close the shades, or activate a scene that you’ve pre-set in the Home app. HomePod can even control these devices when you’re not home via the Home app, giving you the power to remotely control your devices from anywhere. So far, HomeKit compatible with connected devices from Ecobee, Honeywell, August, Kwikset, Philips Hue, Lutron, and more. What about audio specs? Apple wanted to create a speaker that delivered state-of-the-art sound that “rocks the house.” The HomePod includes an Apple-designed four-inch woofer for a deeper bass and seven beam-forming tweeters for high frequency acoustics. All of this was designed to “preserve the richness and intent of the original recordings.” Of course, we won’t be able to vouch for this until we get to listen to it later this year. Does it support multi-room audio? Thanks to the new AirPlay 2, Wi-Fi speakers are now part of the HomeKit family so you can get multi-room audio controls from a single iPhone. This gives you the option to use the Home app to control multiple HomePods in different rooms and sync audio playback. Furthermore, AirPlay 2 is also compatible with Wi-Fi speakers from other manufacturers, including Bose, Bang & Olufsen, Libratone, Devialet, Bowers & Wilkins, and Apple’s own Beats. Does it work with Spotify? Unfortunately, the only music streaming service that the HomePod supports is... Apple Music (act surprised). In fact, Apple claims the smart speaker was designed to be deeply tied to Apple Music, which costs $10 a month. And we don’t foresee Apple bringing another other services to the fold anytime soon (or ever). Apple What if I am an Apple Music member? If you’re an Apple Music member, the HomePod can access Apple Music’s full catalog, as well as tap into machine learning to learn about your music preferences and suggest songs and artists you might like. Apple refers to the HomePod as the perfect musicologist. In addition, you can create a shared Up Next queue with other nearby iOS devices so that everyone in the house can participate in picking music. Does it have any other new technology? Not every room is the same, so the HomePod has learned about spatial awareness. Its built-in sensors can determine the size and layout of its surroundings to automatically deliver the volume and acoustic output that best fills the room. Think of it as virtual surround sound. When two paired HomePods are in the room, they’ll be able to sense each other to deliver actual surround sound. Will it be listening in to all my conversations? Privacy is also being touted as a vital component of the HomePod. According to Apple, the smart speaker will only start collecting information after the “Hey Siri” voice command is activated. This means that you shouldn’t be afraid that the HomePod is secretly recording your conversations in order to sell you stuff. All information is recorded locally on the device and sent to Apple servers encrypted using an anonymous Siri ID. What iOS devices is it compatible with? HomePod is compatible with iPhone 5s and later, running the latest iOS 11. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Phil Schiller, Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, introduces the HomePod speaker at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Monday in San Jose, Calif. Photo: AP tech Siri, speakers and software: Highlights from the Apple show June 6 06:42 am JST 2 Comments SAN JOSE, Calif Siri is getting a new voice, and the Mac is getting a new name. Apple unveiled new hardware, including a Siri-powered speaker, and previewed upcoming iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch features as the company's Worldwide Developers Conference kicked off Monday. Here are the highlights: SIRI-POWERED SPEAKER An internet-connected speaker called HomePod is coming in December for about $350. The speaker is similar to cheaper devices from Amazon and Google. Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research, says the price is good for a high-end audio device. Besides playing music, Apple's Siri digital assistant will also respond to requests for information and other help around the house. A NEW, SMARTER SIRI With an upcoming software update for iPhones and iPads, Siri will learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay using Apple Pay. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Siri, meanwhile, is getting a new voice. Or make that new voices, with a male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. And Apple Watch is bringing Siri front and center. The smartwatch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY Apple says its Safari browser on the Mac will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. Another Safari feature will stop video from automatically playing on websites. The features are part of the Mac software update this fall, to be called High Sierra. The current version is just Sierra. As for HomePod, Apple says that while the speaker's always listening, nothing will be sent to Apple's servers until you say, "Hey, Siri." The protection is similar to what Google Home and Amazon's Echo speakers already offer. Even then, Apple says it won't know who you are — it'll just get an anonymous ID to help process a response. A DIFFERENT REALITY Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Although Apple is late to the game, CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says the new tools come "as the technology hits an inflection point." Apple's new iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities, which Apple says makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. So far, interest in VR has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change that. NEW HARDWARE Apple is introducing a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. That size offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. The new iPad starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also unveiled new Macs, addressing complaints that Apple has let its Mac lineup languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. New iMacs and MacBook laptops start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro coming in December starting at about $5,000. UPDATES FOR THE IPHONE AND IPAD With the next version of the iOS system for mobile devices, messages will sync in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage space. For photos, Apple is replacing JPEGs with a new format meant to reduce file sizes. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple will also have new tools for organizing photos and creating sharable videos. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay someone back through its payment service, Apple Pay, much as PayPal and other services already do. Before, Apple Pay transactions could be done only with businesses and institutions. Apple Maps will get lane guidance for highways and floor plans for indoor malls and airports. Google Maps already does both. And Apple will have a new "do not disturb" mode for driving. The phone will block most notifications to reduce temptations behind the wheel. The free software, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Presumably, Samsung is only just around the corner with something similar, too.) At its annual developer conference in San Jose, California, on Monday, Apple promised its personal assistant software Siri a second home (or third or fourth if you count her macOS or watchOS presence). Having housed her up in iPhones for the past six years, her Cupertino, California-based sugar daddy rewarded her with residence inside a mic'd speaker called HomePod. Like Amazon Alexa in her Echo, Google Assistant in her Home, and Microsoft Cortana's planned appearance in Harman Kardon's forthcoming Invoke speaker, Apple Siri in her HomePod represents an effort to take a voice-based computing interface beyond the desktop and mobile devices. The HomePod has a face for radio. It resembles a large ball of twine, at least the white version. It also comes in hairball gray. Apple's approach, as befits its investment in music, focuses on the output, the speaker. HomePod is cast as a complement to Apple Music, a sensible marketing strategy considering that these bi-directional audio devices haven't yet really found a reason for being beyond demanding that stuff be brought to one's door. Of course, Siri via HomePod will be able to send text messages, recount news and weather updates, and manipulate HomeKit-enabled devices like thermostats and garage door openers. But not everyone wants to buy networked lights just to tell Siri to toggle them. Music, if not the killer app for IoT hubs, is at least something more than a handful of people care about. "Just like iPod reinvented music in our pockets, HomePod is going to reinvent music in our homes," said Phil Schiller, senior veep of worldwide marketing. Déjà vu Apple has been here before, with the iPod Hi-Fi, a semi-portable speaker system panned for its weight, lackluster features, and high price ($350) when launched in 2006. That happens to be the planned price of the HomePod, slated to debut in December. While it's significantly more expensive than Google Home ($130) or Amazon Echo ($180), the HomePod compares favorably to competing speakers like the Sonos 5 ($500) and perhaps to the Cortana-infused Harman Kardon speaker, which has yet to disclose a price. Apple made much of the HomePod's capacity to improve the experience of listening to music, and its forthcoming operating system updates will help in that regard. Its software's pending support for multi-room audio could make managing multiple speakers in conjunction with multiple audio sources less vexing. Staking out a position on Apple's oft-visited privacy high ground, Schiller offered reassurance that the HomePod doesn't record anything until the user addresses Siri. Amazon Echo and Google Home work the same way, maintaining active mics (unless disabled by the user) that supposedly don't transmit data until the invocation phrase has been detected. But Apple's disinterest (or arguably incompetence) in advertising makes it a more plausible privacy partner than its peers. Security researchers consider the presence of these devices a potential privacy risk, though perhaps it's less likely than being fooled by a phishing message or revealing too much via social media. Alongside risks, there may be benefits. In a recent murder investigation, Arkansas authorities sought audio data captured by an Amazon Echo. Amazon resisted the demand, a necessary step to reassure potential customers. Then the defendant in the case subsequently allowed authorities access to the voice recordings Amazon had captured, turning the privacy risk into a bid for exoneration. Beyond evidence, HomePod and its ilk may eventually become indispensable channels to summon service from a cloud of connected devices. Until then, they'll at least be able to play tunes on demand. And that counts for something. The HomePod will be available in Australia, the UK, and the US when it ships in December. ® Tips and corrections 50 Comments MORE Apple Iot Siri Ai Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Apple finally teaches Android music app to validate certificates Cupertino's so keen on Android it took eight months to repair interception bug 3 Comments Apple fights off iTunes patent spat appeal That bit where you said we didn't have to give them $500m – stick with that 7 Comments Apple blocks comms-snooping malware Leaked developer certificate revoked, protection updated 12 Comments Nokia, Apple lawyers make peace over nasty IP wrangle Unspecified lump sum heading for Finland 24 Comments Apple asks FCC to let it run mm-wave tests - for backhaul?!

Annual and the Midwinter Meeting alike both frequently revisit ALA’s home ground, where the central location helps ensure a high turnout. In other ways, however, this year’s get-together is all about change. Winds of Change Authors & Celebrities Restaurants Externally, the political climate in which ALA and libraries operate is highly volatile: while President Trump’s attempt to zero out funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) came to naught in the 2017 federal budget cycle (see p. 14), in part owing to impassioned advocacy, the effort signaled that nothing can be assumed to be off limits and that the pressure is on to defend funding for 2018. State and local funding are also under pressure, not only from direct cuts to libraries but from cuts elsewhere in budgets that push more responsibilities back on cities and towns. Learning how to fight back effectively without being constantly on the defensive—and buying into a narrative of threats to libraries’ very existence that omits the possibility of growth—is one of the key agenda items for many librarians at conference and afterward. Internally, ALA is also in a time of transition. As longtime executive director Keith Michael Fiels and ALA Washington Office head Emily Sheketoff depart, the organization is tasked with finding new leaders who can guide the association through challenging times and on to new triumphs. The direction some of those efforts will take is already clear: at Midwinter in Atlanta, ALA Council added equity, diversity, and inclusion as a fourth strategic direction for the organization, and those thematics are deeply embedded in the program offerings for annual, including several ticketed events that were already sold out at press time. Also on the agenda is getting more nimble in response to late-breaking news. In that regard, ALA certainly expects librarians to practice what they preach: the association scheduled a surprise closing session speaker whose identity was revealed at the last minute—Hillary Clinton! Below, LJ’s ­editors attending annual share some of the sessions they’re hoping to catch.—Meredith Schwartz Mahnaz Dar Assistant Managing Editor Healthy Aging @ Your Library: Connecting Older Adults to Health Information Sat., Jun. 24, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W175b) Are your oldest patrons being served?

International Comics—Culture & Creation Beyond America Sun. Jun. 25, 1–2:30 p.m. (Hyatt Regency McCormick, Jackson Park/MCP 10ab) Graphic novels have long been one of my top formats, and some of my all-time favorites hail from beyond our shores (from Tsugumi Ohba’s manga “Death Note” to Penelope Bagieu’s recent California Dreamin’), so I’m eagerly awaiting this session about comics creation and fandom across the globe. Matt Enis Senior Editor, Technology Collaborating To Promote Cultural Identity in Public Libraries Through the Portal to Texas History Sat., Jun. 24, 10:30–11:30 a.m. (MCP W181b) Jacob Mangum and Ana Krahmer from the Univ. of North Texas Libraries (UNT) will discuss “The Portal to Texas History,” a digital library created by UNT to digitize and build access to photographs, court records, maps, news videos, newspapers, and other historically relevant materials from the region.

Measures That Matter: Building Bridges Between Data Collection Activities in Public Libraries Sat., Jun. 24, 10:30–11:30 a.m. (MCP S106a) With data ever more important in society at large, it is critical that libraries more effectively use data as a collective tool to illustrate impact and help evaluate productive investment.

The Library Card Challenge: Local Leaders Collaborating for Increased Access to Educational Resources Sat., Jun. 24, 10:30–11:30 a.m. (Hyatt Regency Chicago, Columbus EF) Collaboration between schools and public libraries continues to evolve.

Growing Readership Through Diversity Sat., Jun. 24, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W190a) The push for diverse materials in our libraries includes collections for adults. Here publishers and librarians discuss. Bill McKibben: Imagining a World That Works—in Time To Preventa World That Doesn’t Sat., Jun. 24, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP S102) Don’t miss environmentalist, activist, and author Bill McKibben—a critical voice in a critical time. Diversity, Inclusion, and Social Justice in Technical Services Reaching in To Reach Out: Examining the State of Inclusivity Across Libraries, Archives, and Museums Both: Sat., Jun. 24, 3–4 p.m. (MCP W184bc/W185bc) Ideally, these important stances don’t end when the public or students aren’t in the room but extend to back room work, organizational design, and partnerships. These two programs, roomed next door to each other, promise conversation about how to imbed these ethics ever deeper in our libraries and partner organizations. Community Driven: Transforming the Subject Librarian Model in Public Libraries Sun., Jun. 25, 8:30–10 a.m. (MCP W175a) An intriguing approach to specialization and community engagement from Omaha PL, with librarians focused outward on “subject areas” such as Homelessness & Poverty, Health & Wellness, Seniors, Business, and Genealogy & Local History.

Sorry to miss it! Kiera Parrott Reviews Director Opening General Session featuring Reshma Saujani Fri., Jun. 23, 4–5:15 p.m. (MCP W375b/Skyline) Reshma Saujani is the founder of Girls Who Code, a nonprofit organization that empowers young women to enter the tech workforce and helps them learn computer programming skills. Her inspiring TED Talk, “Teach Girls Bravery, Not Perfection,” has well over three million views. She’ll also be a special keynote speaker at School Library Journal’s SLJTeen Live digital eventthis August. You Can’t Stay Neutral on a Moving Train: Making Critical Librarianship Tangible Through Library Programs and Exhibits Sat., Jun. 24, 8:30–10 a.m. (MCP W187c) How does social justice fit into library work? How can librarians support marginalized groups through library services? Rather than a broad philosophical discussion, this looks to be a practical session offering concrete ways library staff can make their programs and services more diverse and inclusive. Desegregating Public Libraries: The Tougaloo Nine Sun., Jun. 25, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W184d) In 1961, nine students from Tougaloo College entered a whites-only library in Jackson, MS, and were arrested. Fifty years after the event, one of the students, Geraldine Edwards Hollis, tells her story. Lisa Peet Associate Editor, News Washington Office Update Session—Be a Catalyst: Your Portfolio of Resources To Create Catalytic Change in Communities Sat., Jun. 24, 8:30–10 a.m. (MCP W176a) The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) recently launched an initiative aimed at assisting libraries and museums to develop their roles as community change agents, and IMLS director Kathryn K.

Daytime Astronomy at Your Library Sat., Jun. 24, 1–2:30 p.m. (Hyatt Regency McCormick, Grant Park/MCP 12ab) The first solar eclipse in 40 years, coming on August 21, promises to be a great opportunity to get patrons excited. The panel will highlight participatory, multimedia activities for adults and children that can be easily implemented in the library, including tips for safe solar viewing and astronomy tools to engage customers all year long. From MLS to MLD: It’s Time To Integrate Design Thinking and Philosophy into LIS Education Sun., Jun. 25, 8:30–10 a.m. (MCP W192) As design thinking becomes more ingrained into library practices, it stands to reason that it should be incorporated into library education as well. The knowledgeable panel includes public and academic librarians as well as LIS instructors with hands-on design thinking experience, and the session will look at how design precepts can help prepare tomorrow’s librarians to develop a problem-finding, solution-oriented mind-set. The Knight Foundation: Innovation in Libraries, Beyond the Talk Sun., Jun. 25, 10:30–11:30 a.m. (MCP W184bc) Full disclosure: I was one of the library professionals interviewed by the Knight Foundation during the development of the featured report and attended the public library directors’ think tank where many of its ideas were surfaced. A report like this is never static, however, and I’m interested to hear how this in-depth look at ways that libraries can jump-start their innovation process has been expanded and developed by three library leaders who are taking these concepts and running with them. Crisis Communication: Who Speaks for Your Library? Sun., Jun. 25, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W194b) As LJ’s news editor, I’ve learned that libraries have their share of disasters, triumphs, conflicts, gossip, and opinions. Having the chance to tell their own stories to the media gives libraries an advantage when it comes to community perceptions, and these concerns don’t begin and end with their communications directors or PR person. This discussion group, with a panel of speakers from United for Libraries, RUSA, and Chapter Relations, will examine aspects of crisis communication so libraries can begin to formulate a communications plan. Meredith Schwartz Executive Editor Protest & Preservation Sat., Jun. 24, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W176a) Activism has always produced a lot of artifacts—from posters to manifestos—and they’ve often been a challenge to document. The shift to fast, decentralized organizing via social media, from the Arab Spring to the Women’s March, only increases those challenges. LJ’s coverage of the Documenting the Now project first sensitized me to these issues; I look forward to hearing the panelists’ perspective, particularly because it includes voices from outside of libraries, including a political philosopher and a documentary filmmaker. Awesomeville All Access: Sharing Our Cities and Towns Sat., Jun. 24, 3–4 p.m. (MCP W187c) We are increasingly seeing libraries and librarians taking an active role in civic change beyond the library—not just leading by example but by getting their hands dirty to achieve larger community goals. I’m intrigued to learn how libraries are assisting access to local cultural venues, public spaces, nature, and more by “acting as agents and brokers.” Applying Racial Equity Analysis to Library Policies, Programs and Processes Sun., Jun. 25 3–4 p.m. (MCP W180) I often hear from librarians who are aware that institutionalized racism impacts their libraries but aren’t sure what to do about it, so I’m excited to hear about lessons learned and concrete tools, including resources available through the Local and Regional Government Alliance on Race and Equity and the Center for Social Inclusion (CSI), from 2016 LJ Mover & Shaker Amita Lonial as well as Simran Noor, CSI’s VP, policy and programs. Library Takeover; or, How Madison Public Library Relinquished Control of Community Programming to…Wait for It…Actual Community Members Sun., Jun. 25, 3–4 p.m. (MCP W187b) I’m excited to learn about an innovative, six-week event planning boot camp that offered up significant library resources, spaces, and money to participant teams made up of individual, nonaffiliated community members to build large-scale community events around the city, with racial equity as a key objective. Asking for a Friend: Tough Questions (and Honest Answers) About Organizational Culture Mon., Jun. 26, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W192) Organizational culture is often the make it or break it factor in whether new initiatives succeed and employees are satisfied. Yet they’re hard to initiate intentionally and often even harder to change. In this session, “several public library leaders have vowed to tell the unvarnished truth when asked about organizational culture”: Susan Brown, Chapel Hill PL; Richard Kong, Skokie PL, and Megan Egbert, Meridian District Library. Audience members can submit questions both beforehand and during the session and can “Ask for a Friend” to maintain a safe environment. Stephanie Sendaula Associate Editor, LJ Reviews The (In)Flexible Box: Transforming Older Library Spaces Sat., Jun. 24, 8:30–10 a.m. (MCP W179a) I’ve been interested in library design since the placemaking session at this past Midwinter. Since space and cost are limitations for libraries of all types, I’m eager to hear advice from librarians and architects on how to reconfigure existing spaces to fit modern need. Aging—a New Frontier: Implications and Opportunities for Libraries and Librarians Sun., Jun. 25, 8:30–10 a.m. (MCP W175b) How can we better serve older adults? Learn more from the Retired Members Round Table, the Western Reserve Area Agency on Aging, and public librarians in this informative, practical session. Whole Person Librarianship: Libraries and Social Workers in Collaboration Sun., Jun. 25, 1–2:30 p.m. (MCP W178a) Based on a standing-room-only conversation starter in 2015, this program features successful collaborations between libraries and social service providers. Libraries Unlimited is also planning a forthcoming book on the subject. Libraries and the Military/Veteran Population: Transformative Service Through Cultural Competencies Sun., Jun. 25, 3–4 p.m. (MCP W179b) I’m also eager to learn how we can engage with veterans, service members, and their families. This team of panelists includes veterans, librarians from military families, and others performing outreach. The Glass Is Half Full: Getting More out of Less Mon., Jun. 26, 10:30–11:30 a.m. (MCP W175b) We’re used to doing more with less, but we could always use new ideas on how to save both time and money. Join librarians from public libraries and government agencies to share ideas on how to lead with staffing shortages, prevent burnout, and adapt to change. Exhibits McCormick Place–Chicago, 2301 S. King Dr., Chicago, IL With 900-plus exhibitors, the hall will offer a few new attractions in ALA’s backyard.

Laptops by Lori Grunin 6 June 2017 5:50 am AEST @LoriGrunin Apple unveils iMac Pro at WWDC Apple reveals its new high-end iMac Pro workstation. The new machine will be $4,999 and available in December. 2:29 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF For WWDC 2017, Apple headed south to San Jose, dogged by damning comparisons with Google, Facebook and Microsoft over its lack of attention to mixed reality (VR and AR), Siri's absence from your smart home in comparison with smart home hubs like the Google Home  and Amazon Echo and other ways in which Apple seems to have fallen behind. Folks were eager to hear about Apple's plans to catch up in these leading-edge markets. 49 Apple's biggest WWDC announcements Even before the conference opening, we began to hear the numbers: iOS app developers earned $20 billion in 2016 (and given Apple's 30 percent cut, that means it made a not-so-paltry $6 billion) and downloads are growing at a nice pace. The company updated its Swift Playgrounds, a teach-kids-to-code-Swift (its proprietary programming language) app, to support control over robots and drones. The keynote began with a video showing how the world would fall apart if we didn't have our iOS apps and the safe and sane App Store. And in a random announcement, we see a small step for Amazon, a huge leap for Apple TV owners: you're getting an Amazon Video app.  And of course, all the inteligence is driven by enhanced Apple AI technology. Later in the conference, Michelle Obama will be talking empowerment. Apple's HomePod is a smart speaker for your home Apple wants the new Siri-powered device to be the center of your home. It will cost $349 and will be available starting in December. by Scott Stein 1:00 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF HomePod Interestingly, Apple positioned its new home speaker as a music experience rather than just the rumored a smart-home hub, ostensibly to "reinvent home music." You can't get it until later in 2017, though. Dubbed the HomePod, it has better audio specs than other hub speakers -- pretty good audio specs in general for its size -- and an A8 chip for processing (the same chip that's in the iPhone). It uses a wide-array mic that supposedly can hear you over the music, and naturally integrates with Apple Music and can control HomeKit devices. It will ship in December for $350.  16 Say hello to Apple's HomePod smart speaker iOS 11 and apps The latest update of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 11, has some notable new features: Interface: A redesigned app drawer with horizontal scrolling as well as a redesigned control center with more 3D Touch operations. The lockscreen can show all notifications,  iMessages: Automatic message synchronization across devices via iCloud. Apple Pay: Now it supports person-to-person payments across all iOS devices and works with iMessages. Siri: She's got a more natural-sounding voice and can translate for you and suggest tasks. Plus there's a new more visual interface. And she knows you across your devices. But she'll respect your privacy. Camera: New H.265 video encoding for more efficient storage and a new High Efficiency Image Format based on H.265 to replace JPEG. Threre's a new depth API (needed for AR). It will enable the faux defocus mode for portraits, too. Photos: Welcome editable Live Photos with GIF-like tools like looping and reversing, and a long-exposure effect. Memories now recognizes pets and supports vertical video. Apple Maps: Now with floor plans of the mall! Also lane guidance and a do-not-disturb mode that senses when a car is moving. AirPlay 2: Control multiroom speakers (with supported speakers), and Apple TV. Apple Music will show you your friends's suggested picks. Redesigned App Store with a games tab. And more, of course. Though not a feature, Apple also launched an augmented-reality programming interface, ARKit, so that developers can incorporate AR into apps. It demoed a better-looking Pokemon Go built using it. 29 Here are the iOS 11 features Apple announced at WWDC 2017  MacBooks and iMacs The iMacs get better displays, better storage options, an improved display and 2 Thunderbolt/USB-C connectors. Also, an update to Intel 7th-generation and the new integrated graphics, plus the Retina 4K incorporates the discrete RX500 series and the 5K model gives you Radeon RX500 series options. That puts them on par with Windows 10 all-in-ones. The 21.5-inch starts at $1,100 and the 5K 27-inch starts at $1,800. A 4K 21.5 inch starts at $1,300. A new iMac Pro will ship by the end of the year, the company's most powerful Mac ever. It has better cooling than a typical iMac, it ships with up to an 18-core Xeon, Radeon Vega graphics, up to 128GB of ECC memory and up to 4TB of SSD storage.  And it will start at $5,000 when it ships in December. The MacBooks are refreshed with 7th-generation Intel chips and better graphics, and the 13-inch without Touchbar gets a price drop to $1,300. The Air gets a brush-up. 13 The new iMac Pro is truly a beast iPad and iPad Pro Apple adds an iPad Pro model with a 10.5-inch display in the 9.7-inch body, thanks to smaller bezels. Both iPad Pros will get new displays, with True Tone, DCI-P3 gamut, 600-nit brightness and ultralow reflectivity. A new feature, Pro Motion, bumps the refresh rate to 120Hz. Latency drops to 20ms with the Apple Pencil. They're also faster, thanks to the 12-core GPU and six-core CPU Fusion A10X chip. A better camera with 4K and wide-gamut capture is another hardware highlight, along with USB-C fast charging. They both come with 64GB memory and start at $650 for the smaller and $800 for the larger model. They'll be available next week. There are more iPad-specific features in iOS 11. Swipe up to bring up the dock to switch apps or bring one up and drag-and-drop anything. A new Files app brings a more desktoplike file system operation that supports third-party storage providers. There's a special markup mode for use with the Pencil and it does handwriting recognition in Notes. MacOS High Sierra The MacOS desktop operating system didn't get a major update, as you can tell from the name, just some refinements. But a lot of the High Sierra refinements are performance-focused, which is always welcome. The big enhancements: Safari: It "helps give you a serene browsing experience." Whut? But now it's faster, with autoplay blocking, intelligent tracking prevention to filter cross-site scripting and so on. Mail: Split view for the compose window, smaller storage footprint. Photos: New organization and editing tools, filter by keywords and file types, better face recognition, synchronization across devices. The editing tools can now synchronize with other editing tools. And there are new photo book partnerships. The file system: This has needed an update for a long time, and now the much more modern APFS is the default. Video: Support for hardware acceleration and a software encoder for H.265 video. Graphics: An update to its acceleration architecture, Metal 2, with a lot of performance increases. It also supports a new external enclosure for MacBooks, with Thunderbolt 3 and A Radeon RX 580. Metal 2 also adds hooks for VR. Want MacOS High Sierra and iOS 11 sooner rather than later? Sign up for the public betas. 10 MacOS High Sierra has some really cool new features WatchOS 4 New to WatchOS, Apple's watch operating system: New faces: A new Siri watch face and a new complication for showing notifications, a Kaleidoscope face based on your image and faces with "Toy Story" characters. Fitness: Monthly challenges in the Activity tracker; a new interface and new high-intensity workout in the Workout app, two-way data exchange with gym equipment, and more. Music: It integrates better with Apple Music to feed your favorites to the watch. A vertically scrolling interface. Native Bluetooth to connect to sensors. 25 Apple WatchOS 4 preview in pics It was one of the most fast-moving, packed 2.5-hour WWDC keynotes I've seen in a while. I'm exhausted. See you in a year.

WWDC is traditionally the place where Apple shows off improvements to the software that powers its devices, rather than hardware revisions or brand new machines. But with the company feeling pressure from rivals in the home computer and laptop spaces — and with many of its Mac lines having languished without significant updates for quite a while — many analysts were tipping an uncharacteristically hardware-heavy show, and that's exactly what we got.

More videos Apple drops its latest gear The computer giant unveils an enormous assortment of new products. Hello HomePod As expected, Apple is introducing a smart speaker to compete with Google's Home and Amazon's Echo. The HomePod, Apple says, is a wireless speaker that uses "spatial awareness" to adjust its output to the shape of its surroundings. Designed to pair with an iPhone and play music via a user's Apple Music subscription, the device will also field queries and control other smart home devices thanks to Siri integration. The speaker features an upward-facing woofer, seven tweeters each with dedicated amps and a six-microphone array. The HomePod will launch in Australia in December, although a price is yet to be announced. In the US it will cost $US349 ($466), more than twice the price of its Google competitor. Advertisement iMacs and MacBooks updated, Mac Pro re-imagined While whispers of a touch-enabled Mac line that would open the door to more versatile Apple machines turned out to be baseless, Apple is significantly updating several of its existing products with modern components, as well as introducing a new turbo-charged iMac. The iMac Pro blends the super-thin design of the standard Apple all-in-one with the bleeding-edge productivity focus of the old Mac Pro, packing enough power to handle high-end tasks like 3D modelling for VR. The increased power means Apple needed to craft a new kind of cooling mechanism to keep the components' temperatures lowered in the skinny enclosure. The dark grey computer sports a 27-inch, 5K display and will start at $US4999 ($6676) in the US. So far there is no word on international pricing, and no indication of what the most powerful iteration of the device — with 18-core Xeon processors, a Radeon Pro Vega GPU with 16GB of VRAM and a 4TB SSD hard drive — will cost. For regular folks who don't need a computer that can handle artificial intelligence research, the iMac, MacBook and MacBook Pro have all been brought up to date with new Intel Kaby Lake processors. The iMac now features Thunderbolt 3 ports and, in most models, dedicated graphics chips. At the low end there is still a 21.5-inch iMac with a 2.3GHz processor and a 1080p display, starting at $1599. More powerful 21.5-inch models with 4K screens start at $1899, and 27-inch models with 5K screens start at $2699. Meanwhile the 12-inch Macbook has faster hard drives and now supports up to 16GB of memory, while the 13-inch Pro has a new entry-level model that comes in at $1899. The 15-inch Pro, which starts at $3499, now comes with a more powerful AMD graphics chip with either 2GB or 4GB of memory. The new iMacs, MacBooks and MacBook Pros are all available for order now. iPad Pro gets a refresh Despite ever-shrinking sales, Apple announced a refresh for its line of high-end tablets. The iPad Pro now comes in an all-new 10.5-inch variation in addition to the original 12.9-inch size. The previously available 9.7-inch Pro appears to have been put out to pasture, presumably to avoid confusion with the standard non-Pro iPad, which is the same size. The 10.5-inch Pro has some impressively skinny bezels and weighs in at a tiny 469 grams. Both models feature an improved processor and something Apple calls "ProMotion", which essentially means the screens are now capable of higher refresh rates for smoother video and animations. The new iPad Pro starts at $979 and $1199 for the smaller and larger models respectively. The standard iPad and iPad Mini 4 remain unchanged. First look at iOS 11, MacOS High Sierra and WatchOS updates While the iPhone was largely absent from the announcements at WWDC, Apple did give a sneak peek into the future of the device with the unveiling of a new version of iOS, which also powers its iPads. New in iOS 11 will be a better camera app, a more capable Apple Pay system, a new version of Apple Maps with indoor mapping and a new toolkit to help developers bring augmented reality features to their apps. On iPad Pro, a redesigned app switcher and customisable dock gives the operating system a flatter, more modern look. The new software also contains a "Do Not Disturb While Driving" mode, which Apple says will help prevent iPhones distracting those behind the wheel, and a new "Files" app that resembles a traditional computer file system for viewing and organising documents. On the Mac front, Apple showed off High Sierra, the next version of MacOS. The update includes refinements to Photos and enhanced ad-blocking features for Safari. Most improvements will be under the hood, including an all-new file system, VR features and support for the new HEVC video standard. Finally, the company previewed some improvements coming to the Apple Watch. A new Siri watchface predicts what you'll want to see when you look at your wrist, while improvements to the device's fitness features will let you track new types of high-intensity workouts. 3 comments Log in to comment New User?

By Jared Newman TechHive | Jun 5, 2017 3:19 PM PT Credit: TechHive More like this Apple HomePod FAQ: Here’s everything we know about the new Siri smart speaker The state of the Apple HomeKit market: Apple's smart-home ecosystem has yet to... Apple AirPlay 2 adds whole-home audio for speakers Video ShapeScale 3D body scanner hands-on Apple has announced its long-rumored answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Dubbed the HomePod, it's a $349 Siri-powered speaker that will try to outshine its competitors in terms of audio quality. "Just like the iPod reinvented music in our pockets, HomePod is going to reinvent music in our homes," said Apple's head of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. Mentioned in this article Amazon Echo Dot (2nd generation)  TechHive rating $49.99MSRP $49.99View on Amazon On stage, Schiller talked up the HomePod's acoustic qualities, which include seven beam-forming horn-loaded tweeters, each with its own amplifier, and a four-inch powered woofer that can adapt to the acoustic characteristics of the room it's playing in. All that's driven by an Apple A8 processor, similar to what's inside the iPhone 6 and fourth-generation Apple TV. Users can also set up two HomePods next to one another, and they'll synchronize for better sound, the speaker will support whole-home audio with other speakers that support Apple's AirPlay 2 wireless audio technology. [ Further reading: The best white LED smart bulbs ] TechHive The HomePod flexes its audio quality muscles. To activate the speaker, users can say "Hey Siri" and then ask to play songs from Apple Music. Schiller talked up the HomePod's "musicologist" features, which can answer requests like "Play something new," "What was the top song in 1983?" and "Who's the drummer in this?" The top of the HomePod is also touch-sensitive for controlling volume and pausing. TechHive Siri can answer all kinds of musical queries on HomePod. Schiller had much less to say about HomePod's broader Siri smarts, although the product page on Apple's website hints that it can perform many of the smart-home tasks that an Amazon Echo or Google Home can do.  In addition to playing music, HomePod can provide news, general knowledge, reminders, podcasts, translation, weather, and HomeKit controls, among other things. But Apple did not announce support for third-party voice skills, like Amazon and Google offer with their smart speakers. Although Siri does support a narrow set of third-party voice actions on iOS devices, it's unclear whether these will be accessible on HomePod. Mentioned in this article Sonos Play:5 (2015 Edition)  TechHive rating $499.00MSRP $499.00View on Amazon Also worth noting: Apple didn't announce support for any music services beyond its own Apple Music. Users might be able to send music from an iOS or Mac device over AirPlay, but it doesn't sound like there's a way to request music by voice from third-party services like Spotify, Pandora, Amazon Music, or TuneIn. (Conversely, HomePod will be the only connected speaker with Apple Music support.) TechHive Siri supports some general queries on HomePod, but there's no word on third-party product integration. In lieu of those skills, Apple is banking on HomePod's superior audio quality to stand out from the competition. HomePod's room-equalization feature sounds very similar to Sonos' TruePlay, but Sonos is relying on Amazon's Alexa for voice control. What's more, that project is still in the works. By the same token, you can drive beefier speakers with a $50 Echo Dot, but Apple's solution is less cluttered and it offers whole-home audio support. HomePod might also have some unique appeal to folks who've invested in Apple's burgeoning HomeKit smart home ecosystem. Still, those users will have to wait a while to get one. Apple plans to launch HomePod in December for $349, starting with the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Apple is not yet taking pre-orders.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Home is now available for pre-order in Canada By Ida Torres - June 5, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you live in Canada and you’ve been reading all these news items about the new voice-activated smart speaker from Google, you’ve probably been wondering when you will be able to have something like that for your home. Wonder no more as the tech giant has officially announced that Google Home is finally available for pre-order through the Google Store and through BestBuy.com. This also means that Google Assistant is coming to Canadian homes in both English and French. With the magic words, “Ok Google”, you will now be able to do a lot of things without having to lift your smartphone or any other gadget around you. You can ask your Google Assistant questions and it can tap into a whole world of Google through Search, Maps, Translate, etc. You can also ask it to help you manage your tasks, set schedules, add items in your to-do lists, set alarms and reminders, etc. If it’s music that you’re looking for, Google Home can give that to you because after all, it is a speaker. But with just simple voice commands, you can get services like Spotify or Google Play Music to play your favorite songs, news, podcasts, or even radio. And it will bring it to you in Hi-Fi sound quality. And when giving your commands, the speaker can still hear you even if you’re a bit away through far-field microphones and natural language processing. You can also use Google Assistant to control lights and switches in smart devices like Nest, Philips, or Samsung SmartThings. Google Home can be pre-ordered through the Google Store or through BestBuy.com. It will cost you around $179.99.

The Mail yesterday found a series of tirades by Ahmad Musa Jibril and Abu Haleema that were easily accessible on the video sharing site. They used the Google-owned video platform to spread the warped messages which helped turn 27-year-old Khuram Butt into a fanatic bent on mass slaughter. In the videos found by the Mail, they told followers to make ‘enemies’ out of all kuffar [non-believers], and instructed Islamists not to grieve for terror victims. Jibril: The ranting preacher of hate condemns Muslims who feel sorry for terror victims Haleema: In one diatribe (pictured) he declares that he will never stop calling for Sharia law They also branded moderate Muslims as ‘malignant tumours’ in the Islamic community, and denounced the London Mayor Sadiq Khan – a Muslim – as kuffar. According to a friend of Butt, he was obsessed with Jibril, and became radicalised after watching YouTube videos of the preacher. He was also an associate of Haleema, appearing alongside him in last year’s Channel 4 documentary, the Jihadis Next Door. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Manchester bomber's brother, 23, who was arrested in... Goldsmiths in Twitter spat over London terror attack: Jemima... Share this article Share The hate preacher’s videos have been watched more than a million times, and won warped comments of approval from viewers, one of whom wrote: ‘Kuffar must [and] will be eliminated’. But Google has refused to remove them, insisting they did not break its own rules. Last night, politicians and terror experts accused the US technology giant of ‘colluding’ with hate preachers. Yvette Cooper, the Labour candidate for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford and former shadow home secretary, said: ‘It is sickening that extremist, terrorist material which intends to radicalise people so that they carry out heinous attacks like the one we saw on London Bridge is still easily available on YouTube. According to a friend of Butt, he was obsessed with Jibril, and became radicalised after watching YouTube videos of the preacher Butt was also an associate of Haleema, appearing alongside him in last year’s Channel 4 documentary, the Jihadis Next Door ‘Google are aiding and abetting terrorists by leaving this vile stuff online. This platform is being used to feed warped ideologies that support deathly attacks.’ Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said there was ‘no question at all’ that the material should be removed. ‘[The technology companies] bear clear moral responsibility for the harm that is done. They collude in the Islamist incitement. ‘GCHQ could disrupt these channels of communication. Let the US companies sue the UK Government; there’s no English jury that would find for the Americans.’ Last night, a YouTube spokesman said that it wanted to work with the Government. ‘We take our role in combatting the spread of extremist material very seriously,’ the spokesman said. ‘YouTube has clear policies prohibiting terrorist recruitment and content intending to incite violence, and we act quickly to remove videos violating these. We also terminate accounts run by terrorist organisations or those that repeatedly violate our policies.’ Two of the three terrorists - Khuram Butt (left) and Rachid Redouane (right) - who massacred seven people in a rampage which started on London Bridge on Saturday night One of Gabriele Sciotto's photographs showed the face of the dying terrorist, wearing an Arsenal football shirt and combat trousers, just a few metres in front of him However, its words will fall flat in light of the grotesque videos by Jibril and Haleema still circulating on YouTube. Jibril, a Palestinian-American cleric, denounced religious tolerance and condemned Muslims who feel sympathy for victims of terror attacks. In one video, watched more than 41,000 times, Jibril tells his followers: ‘[There are] malignant tumours within this umma [Muslim community] crying for the causes of others. The least worst Muslim dying anywhere in the world is more worthy of mourning and attention than the best kaffir.’ Haleema said in a video posted on the day of the 2016 Brussels attack: ‘Don’t try and be like the kuffar [non-believer]. Do not grieve over them.’ He also taunted non-Muslims in a video posted in January 2016, and watched more than 5,000 times. ‘We’re not going to stop calling for the domination of Islam.’ Butt and his fellow murderers were shot dead inside Borough Market and wore fake suicide vests as they ran down people with a white van and then stabbed and slashed people on Saturday night Heleema and Jibril’s messages are also spreading on Facebook and Twitter. Yesterday, the Mail also found many links promoting them on the social networks. One Twitter account set up to spread Jibril’s message offers followers a free DVD. He also has a Facebook page with links to his sermons. Facebook and Twitter accounts under Haleema’s name were also last night active, though it is not clear whether they are genuine. Twitter declined to comment on ‘privacy’ grounds. Most of Haleema’s YouTube videos were posted before he appeared in the Channel 4 documentary in January 2016. In 2015, he was accused of radicalising a schoolboy who was convicted over a plot to behead police during an Anzac Day parade in Australia. He was arrested on suspicion of encouraging terrorism in 2015. He does not appear to have posted to YouTube since June 2016. His whereabouts are unknown.

(Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) That right there? That's on'a them Homepods. (Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) Although a new product announcement from Apple isn’t the major pop-cultural event that it used to be, the pitiless taskmaster that is capitalism demands that the company continue pressing ever forward with sleek new gadgets exciting enough to convince consumers that last year’s gadget just isn’t good enough anymore. It did so today at the WWDC (World Wide Developer’s Conference), its annual in-house presentation of its newest innovations for software developers as reported by The New York Times. Chief among those innovations is the Homepod, Apple’s answer to Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Google Home. Aside from its rippity-rappin’ name, the Homepod does pretty much the same stuff all those other home assistants do, but with a more streamlined design. Voiced by a reportedly new and improved Siri, the particular gadget will retail for $349, which is significantly more than its rivals—the Echo currently retails for $179 and Google Home for $129—but its speakers are supposedly better than the rest, thus justifying the higher price tag. It will be available in December. Then there’s the new iPad Pro. Apple may be playing catchup in the home-assistant realm, but it innovated tablets back in 2010 with the original iPad; the only problem is, iPads apparently don’t break often enough, resulting in a decline in sales in recent years. So, to persuade existing iPad customers to buy another one, Apple has unveiled an iPad Pro with a 10.5-inch display, in between the 9.7 inch and 12.9-inch models. It’s also got something called ProMotion that’s supposed to ”increase the refresh rate and make motion smoother in video content,” although if it’s anything like the motion-smoothing technology on HDTVs that produces the dreaded “soap opera effect,” that may or may not be a good thing. Regardless, the 10.5 inch iPad Pro retails for $649 and starts shipping next week. Aside from the expected introduction of new versions of its mobile (iOS 11) and computer (High Sierra) operating systems—the latter of which does come with one exciting feature, blocking autoplay videos on Safari—the other big announcement at the unusually hardware-focused presentation was the unveiling of a new version of Apple’s desktop model iMac Pro. The souped-up new version ”will support up to 18 core processors and include a graphic chipset called Radeon Vega,” making it Apple’s most powerful computer to date, according to the NYT. Apple’s been lagging behind in terms of professional-quality hardware in recent years, with its last high-performance desktop model, the MacPro, landing with a thud back in 2013. Giving the new iMacPro another chance won’t come cheap, though: These super-powered new models go for $5,000 a pop and will be available in December. Submit your Newswire tips here.

Amazon may launch 'Ice' smartphones in India running Android with Google services Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 11:17am PDTJun 5, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 Amazon News Rumors Amazon famously misread the market when it launched the Fire Phone in 2014 without any Google apps. Scarcely a year later Amazon had abandoned the device in the face of minuscule sales figures. Now, it's rumored to be prepping a new smartphone, but unlike the Fire Phone, this one will apparently run a version of Android with Google services. The report claims Amazon will brand these new phones as "Ice," and they will ship with Android 7.1.1. That means they'll have Google Assistant out of the box. Alexa support isn't as clear, but I'd be shocked if Amazon didn't add that. The Ice phone will also have the Play Store and all the apps that come with it. The first of these phones might launch in India by the end of the year, perhaps as a trial before shipping the phone in other markets. This would be an inexpensive phone with modest specs including a 5.2-5.5-inch screen, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, a 13MP camera, and a Snapdragon 435. Amazon is currently planning on a price of Rs 6,000 (roughly $93), but that could change by the time it launches. Well, if it launches.

Bruce Wayne From Fire to Ice. Not so subtle. Daniel 'Cause when Amazon made their last phone, all they did was get burned. XD NexusKoolaid And what did they do with all those unsold Fire phones they had stockpiled? They put 'em on ice. Daniel And what a bummer for them; they really had a burning desire to sell a bunch of them NexusKoolaid But in the end, they just decided to chill out. Daniel Bet you don't get these kind of comments on other websites. lol 4Ui812 She's sun and rain , She's fire and ice , a little crazy but it's nice , and when she gets mad best to leave her alone Daniel "You leave my wife outta this" -Jeff Bezos talking about his phone Lord Argyris Maybe they just like Pokemon? I expect they'll chain as many types that are super effective on the next in line as possible. Expect Flying, Bug and Psychic phones in the coming years. Or Dragon, Dragon, Dragon... MJ Here we go again... At least Amazon figured out it needs to have the Play Store. Pessimippopotamus Has anyone tried to make an E-Ink phone before aside from Yota? I feel like a smartphone that lasts several days with a b&w but very efficient screen would be right up Amazon's alley, especially considering its Kindle lineup, instead of a me-too low-end device. Marty Every e-ink device I've ever used was painfully slow. Unless e-ink can refresh at LCD rates, I don't see it being used as the primary display. Pessimippopotamus This is true. I feel like there's a bigger potential market in it as opposed to something like say... ...a phone with a 4-camera 3D system. 4Ui812 Amazon is taking a page from Microsoft. But I'm telling you ... don't discount MS. That beast is slowly waking up. Marty Agreed. MS will eventually finally have the world's best smartphone...long after the industry and the market has moved onto other things. 😋 4Ui812 No. Microsoft is moving back into software. Hardware was never their forte nor their bread and butter. T4rd I actually thought the opposite; their hardware is pretty solid IMO, esp. their newer tablets and laptops. In the mobile arena, software is definitely what's holding them (and other OEMs from using their software) back. Đức Thành Yup, their hardware isn't something I'd complain about as much as I'd complain about the software. There are times I'd just like to swear at my Windows 10 PC while I'd very seldom do that if at all to my precious Chromebook. T4rd Seems like they're still on their way to sleep right now.. https://seekingalpha.com/news/3271314-microsoft-rolled-os-update-bricked-windows-phones. I'm sure MS will return at some point; if anyone has the resources to brute force the mobile market (again), it's MS. But yeah.. it's going to be a while still.

Jason King How can Amazon sell both a device with Google Services and their Fire tablets? I thought Google Services was all-in-one? MJ It's a PHONE that will have Android and Google services on it. What's the confusion? Google Services agreements are per device... Jason King In the past, members of the Open Handset Alliance were prohibited from making any non-Google approved devices (ie: forked) from a company level, not a device level. It's why Acer had to pull out of the alternate Android OS that Alibaba created called Aliyum a few years ago, but that may have changed more recently. Amazon Fire was determined to be a 'fork' of Android which leads me to believe Google wouldn't allow Google Play Services on any Amazon device. MadMartigan That requirement is placed upon members of the OHA. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to get a device GMS licensed. Therefore, Amazon can do it. Acer cannot. Jason King ahhh - that's the difference then. Thanks for the clarification. Roger Siegenthaler What's the source of that information? Because Google would probably love to know seeing as this exact problem is the basis of their massive monopoly lawsuit in the EU. MadMartigan First: The basis for the EU lawsuit is that OEMs cannot sell Google Play Store compatible devices without Chrome, Google Search, and all the other GMS core apps installed. GMS licensing requires all GMS core apps be installed. Some oems would like to ship devices with Google Play store, but without the core GMS apps. Second: My source is common knowledge and deductive reasoning. Cyanogen, Inc was not a member of the OHA. Xiaomi is not a member of the OHA. Both sell (or sold) GMS devices. Xiaomi also sells non-GMS devices. Conclusions: You can sell GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Cyanogen, Inc.). You can sell non-GMS devices and GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Xiaomi). You can not sell devices with an incompatible fork of Android while a member of the OHA (Acer). Roger Siegenthaler ok; first point is wrong. That's only part of the lawsuit. And your only example that proves you to be correct is false as Xiaomi can only sell non-GMS devices within China; famously exempt from the GMS rules for ALL OEMs. RedPandaAlex Wait... don't they need to join the open handset alliance in order to do this? And doesn't that prohibit them from putting out devices without Google (like the Kindles)? MJ You are the second person who has said this... Where is this coming from? Samsung puts out phone(s) with Tizen on it. Stephen Sharp You can't put out what Google calls an "incompatible fork". This is how they put a stop to Aliyun Labrat Furthermore, if you sell one phone with an "incompatible fork" you can't sell any phone with Google Apps, at least, AFAIK. MadMartigan ...if you are a a member of the OHA. MJ What other phone does Amazon sell? YaKillaCJ They sell tablets and I wonder if the Fire Stick lineup could also violate. Im just curious whats the rules and stipulations. MadMartigan You cannot do this if you are a member of the OHA. If you are not a member, you can have your own Android and GMS Android. The OHA is what forbids that practice. Cael Tizen isn't a fork of Android. MJ Amazon Fire OS is... Rohan Tizen is a different OS while Acer and other using Alyun OS was a fork of android. The former is OK. Otherwise, companies like Samsung, LG would've had to stoop making laptops. MJ I guess you didn't read the whole discussion as someone else had the answer which is NOT your reasoning... Acer and Alyun were part of the Open Handset Alliance while Amazon is NOT. Why are you talking about laptops? LOL MadMartigan No. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to be GMS licensed. In fact, being a member of the OHA would expressly forbid them from doing this. Remember: Acer could not put out their non-GMS device because they were a member of the OHA, which is the body that forbids that sort of thing. vn33 Are they going to write a song about Fire and Ice then?? chromaniac It's going to be hard to compete against the likes of Xiaomi and Lenovo here in India. Flipkart tried and gave up. Micromax is still trying to make a comeback. Hrishikesh Bisen No it's not. At that price point and brand name of Amazon. chromaniac lol ok? MadMartigan Hey Ryan, The OHA/GMS issue seems to be confusing a lot of folks. Any chance AP could do a write up explaining this so people more clearly understand the differences/similarities? Kendall Seabury A phone of fire and ice. Designed by George R. R. Martin. Alvin Samsung's version of the fire phone was a little too literal. Andrew Bone Now just let us cast Amazon video 😉 Đức Thành I guess that one incident with the Fire Phone was enough to make Amazon reconsider its life choices and decide that it was time to grow up. Still, that was a long break that it took. The naming scheme is not bad but still kind of funny. Paul Monroe, Jr. Now if they could just do that with the fire tablets they might actually have something going on..

Apple continues to emphasize privacy. Jordan Novet | @jordannovet Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 5:52 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Kevork Djansezian | Getty Apple just revealed what it's been up to in software for the past year ... and it's remarkably Google-y. During the Monday keynote at the company's 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference, the company announced a bunch of catch-ups: Siri got the ability to translate languages, something Google has provided through Google Translate since 2006. For now, Siri can only translate spoken English into five other languages, while Google's service can work with more than 100 languages, but it's a start. A Do Not Disturb While Driving mode, which delivers a different user interface when iPhone users are driving. Google delivered an Android Auto feature for smartphones last year. Improvements to the AirPlay feature for sharing audio from iOS devices, which one-ups Google's invasion of home audio speakers through the Chromecast Audio dongle. Apple will let people play audio in multiple rooms while Google works on introducing that feature to all speakers that have Chromecast built in. Improvements to the Camera app that comes with iOS so it's able to make loops with the Live Photos video snippets that are automatically created out of each photo. Google introduced this feature in an app called Motion Stills last year. Siri will soon be front and center on the Apple Watch, just like the Google Assistant has started showing up on Android Wear smartwatches. A HomePod speaker that plays music and lets you talk to Siri. The Google Home does similar things but comes with the Google Assistant instead of Siri. More broadly, Apple has built tools for artificial intelligence and augmented reality, and now the company is starting to let outside developers use those tools to enhance their own applications. The thing is, Google already did the same thing, with the Tango mobile augmented reality system and services running in its cloud. To be clear, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Snap have all been busy in both AI and AR. But Google has put AI at the core of its business, with CEO Sundar Pichai going so far as to call it an "AI-first" company. With Apple doing small things to make AI more visible and powerful across more of its devices, the company appears to be acknowledging people's continued use of impressively smart apps like Google Translate and the Google App. The message is clear: We're getting smarter now, so don't even worry about using the Google stuff. The uncertainties lie in how many Google developers and customers will defect.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers — the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad — all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said.

Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. __ Ortutay reported from New York. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

X-23's Sunglasses From 'Logan' (And Other Cool Stuff) Apple's New HomePod Looks Fine As Hell Adam Clark Estes Jun 6, 2017, 6:45am ⋅ Filed to:  apple feature homepod wwdc wwdc 2017 Share It's game-time! Apple just announced its long-awaited take on a smart speaker, completing the smart speaker triumvirate along with Google and Amazon. The gadget itself isn't particularly remarkable, but it is an Apple gadget. That's a big deal for a lot of people. Photo: Apple The new Apple HomePod is a lot like its competitors: Amazon Echo and Google Home. You can activate it with a wake word — "Hey Siri" — and ask an artificially intelligent assistant, Siri, to play music. The HomePod comes with an array of six microphones so that it can pick up your voice from any direction. Apple promises the Siri team has made some updates so that the AI works better for music requests. Apple has also make HomePod a "home assistant" that can answer all kinds of questions and tell you about the weather or the traffic. HomePod also works like a smart home hub for all HomeKit-compatible devices. So now you can ask Siri to turn on the lights or lock the door without moving a muscle. You can also control your HomeKit devices remotely now, using the Home app on any iOS device. Yes, you can do the same thing with an Amazon Echo or a Google Home, but remember: This is an Apple gadget. GIF: Apple / Gizmodo Where Apple hopes to stand out in its late entry to the smart speaker market, however, is by putting extra emphasis on the speaker part of the equation. While the Echo and Home aren't known for great sound quality, Apple engineers — presumably with some help from Beats engineers — built the HomePod for high-fidelity audio quality. That includes a "seven beam-forming tweeter array", "precision acoustic horns" and "directional control". Apple says that you don't need to know what that means but the seven-inch-tall speaker sounds really great. There's also a "virtual surround sound" feature that helps the small speaker fill up a room with your sick jams. In other words, Sonos is now an Apple competitor. Photo: Alex Cranz That's all fun and games until you start to wonder if Siri is now spying on you and your loved ones. Apple says that "only after 'Hey Siri' is recognised locally on the device will any information be sent to Apple servers, encrypted and sent using an anonymous Siri identifier". It's unclear what happens to the data once its on Apple's servers. The new speaker will cost $US349, with Australian pricing to be confirmed — we expect around the $499 to $549 range. It will come in white and space grey and will start shipping in December in Australia, the UK and US. And even though it isn't as feature packed as the latest Echo, you're probably going to want it, if you're an Apple fan. Even if you're not, it's a fine-looking gadget.

Reply -1 targeting compoita @poita Jun 6, 2017, 9:59am Much higher audio quality, and fits into an ecosystem that millions of people are already using. I think they will be okay, and not a lot of luck will be required. I think people constantly miss that this is what Apple does. They start developing a product when a new product category is looming, they let others enter the market space and kludge around, and then after a year or two they enter the market with a (usually) more refined product. They did it with the iPod, it wasn't the first or the cheapest MP3 player by a long shot, but it did okay for them. This is still a nascent market, and this is really the first product to integrate personal assistant stuff with a good quality speaker system. A single SONOS speaker costs this much or more, if it sounds as good or better, then it will probably do more than okay. Reply 1 soldant @soldant Jun 6, 2017, 10:58am This. Apple aren't new or innovative, and they haven't been for decades now. Instead they take existing concepts and refine them into a product the general population likes to use. Very few tech companies do much that's innovative or novel these days - they're iterating on existing ideas most of the time (or bringing ideas back from the dead). I think Apple's HomePod has the potential to be as successful as Alexa or Google Home. Whether or not it will ultimately depends on if people actually want these devices. Reply 0 gtasoz @gtasoz Jun 6, 2017, 4:33pm That was my reaction too. Unless they make the thing SING with connectivity and be truly useful in the Internet-of-Things world :: Home Control, Spatial smarts and other clever things, I can see this status symbol tanking big time. May be wrong but they will have to get it VERY right or people will be severely pissed.

By Barbara Ortutay Associated Press, By Michael Liedtke Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called  machine learning. The "HomePod" speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. SIZING UP THE IPAD Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera -- the same one found in the iPhone 7 -- along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. --The Associated Press Published on: Jun 5, 2017 Advertisement

It will also conclude the remarkable five-year run of Yahoo's chief executive, Marissa Mayer, who was paid nearly a quarter of a billion dollars — a generous sum even by Silicon Valley's lofty standards — while presiding over the company's continued decline.

More videos Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer loses bonus A Yahoo independent committee finds certain senior executives didn't properly "comprehend or investigate" a 2014 security breach. Ms Mayer, now 42, was hailed as a saviour when she left Google for Yahoo in 2012. But during her tenure, Yahoo was hit by two of the biggest privacy breaches in history. Advertisers, Yahoo's bread and butter, fled the service. Users shifted ever more attention to Google, Facebook and other rivals. Yahoo's staff shrank by almost 50 per cent. The company ended up so weakened that its board had little choice but to sell. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Marissa Mayer Photo: Bloomberg "Everyone acknowledges that it was a difficult situation to come into," said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research who has studied Yahoo for years. "But the company was not run well under her tenure." So why did Ms Mayer receive more than $US900,000 ($1.21 million) a week? The answer, like so many things about Yahoo, is surprisingly complicated. It is rooted partly in the never-lose structure of modern executive compensation packages, but also in two farsighted investments made long ago by one of Yahoo's founders, Jerry Yang. Advertisement By Wall Street's most basic yardstick — Yahoo's stock price — Ms Mayer earned every penny she got. Yahoo's share price more than tripled during her tenure. After the $US4.5 billion sale to Verizon, shareholders will still own an investment company with $US57 billion of stock in two Asian internet companies, Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan. Ms Mayer's pay was mostly in stock and stock options, and she reaped the rewards alongside the other stockholders. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the digital age. Photo: AP "The only sign you can point to when evaluating a company over a long period of time is how shareholders have done in the exchange," said David Wise, who heads North American sales at Korn Ferry Hay Group, a firm that advises companies on executive pay packages. "Over the last five years, Yahoo shareholders couldn't have done a lot better than this." More than most chief executives, Ms Mayer was working for those shareholders. She was essentially hired by one hedge-fund manager, Daniel Loeb, who got her predecessor fired and won three seats on Yahoo's board in 2012. Mr Loeb was particularly interested in finding a way to unlock the value of Yahoo's stake in Alibaba, which was already shaping up to be one of China's leading internet companies. He pushed the board to recruit a star like Ms Mayer to get people excited about a company that had been stumbling for years. When Ms Mayer's early efforts to turn around Yahoo's business and spin off the Alibaba shares failed to bear fruit, another hedge fund manager, Jeffrey Smith of Starboard Value, led a campaign to push for her ouster. Mr Smith eventually garnered four board seats so he could keep the pressure on. Yahoo declined to comment for this article, citing this coming Thursday's shareholder vote to approve the Verizon deal. Ms Mayer and the board chairman, Maynard Webb, who approved her pay packages, also declined interview requests. So did Mr Smith. Ms Mayer has come under more scrutiny than most Silicon Valley chief executives, in part because of the Superwoman image she cultivated in an industry dominated by men: the Stanford-trained computer scientist and tireless manager who still wrote code for fun while raising three young children and looking stylish in Oscar de la Renta. 'If she were an ugly man, she'd be a hero' "She was an attractive, high-visibility CEO trying to bring some excitement and glamour to Yahoo," said Martha Josephson, a senior partner at the recruiting firm Egon Zehnder, who helped Ms Mayer find several of her top executives. "As hard as the job was, she didn't get a break. If she were an ugly man, she'd be a hero." On July 16, 2012, the day she was hired, Yahoo's share price was $US15.65. On Friday, it closed at $US50.60. The stock's performance has topped other venerable tech companies like Microsoft, Oracle and Cisco Systems, and matched the gains of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Yahoo's most direct competitor. As Yahoo shareholders profited, so did Ms Mayer. By the time the deal closes, she will have made about $US239 million, based on Friday's share price, according to calculations by Equilar, a provider of executive compensation data. Such stock-heavy compensation structures are the norm in corporate America, where boards of directors seek to align an executive's financial incentives with gains for shareholders. To lure Ms Mayer from Google and compensate her for options she forfeited there, Yahoo's board offered her a lucrative employment agreement. She initially received restricted stock worth $US35 million and stock options worth $US21 million, based on 2012 stock prices for Yahoo, along with a cash salary and bonus. Although she gave up a portion of those stock grants after failing to meet performance targets, the rise in Yahoo's share price more than offset the losses. She received further stock grants in later years, adding to her overall compensation. Yet most of Ms Mayer's paycheck ultimately came from the gains in Yahoo's Alibaba and Yahoo Japan investments, over which she had little control. Thanks to an investment made in 2005, Yahoo had a 24 per cent stake in Alibaba, which today is China's leading e-commerce company. When Alibaba first sold shares to the public in 2014, Yahoo sold 140 million shares in the offering. It hung on to 384 million shares, which are now worth about $US48 billion. Yahoo also owns about 36 per cent of Yahoo Japan, now worth about $US9 billion, that it received as part of a deal struck in 1996, shortly after Yahoo was founded. The surging value of those investments — not any brilliant business moves by Ms Mayer — is why Yahoo's shares went up. "It's like someone coming into an oil company, and all of a sudden oil prices go up and the stock goes up," said Charles  Elson, the director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. "Was the return based on what she did?" Still, managing those investments was a key reason that Yahoo's board hired Ms Mayer. Mr Loeb had accused Yahoo's previous leaders of mishandling both their core business and the Alibaba relationship. When he and two allies gained seats on the board in 2012, they wanted a new chief executive who would fix both problems. Ms Mayer delegated the Alibaba issue, hiring an experienced dealmaker, Jacqueline Reses, to be the company's principal liaison to Alibaba and its leaders, Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai. Ms Reses helped the Chinese company navigate its initial public offering. She also renegotiated an agreement, struck just before Ms Mayer arrived, that would have forced Yahoo to sell an additional 122 million shares in the offering. Those extra shares are now worth $US15 billion. Her great white whale Ms Mayer, meanwhile, focused on turning around Yahoo's internet business. It had missed the mobile revolution and was experiencing steady declines in its display and search advertising. There, her record is decidedly mixed. Yahoo had no real strategy for reaching customers on mobile devices when she arrived — a sure route to obsolescence as smartphones became the principal internet device for most people. ​Through a combination of acquisitions and hiring, she vastly expanded Yahoo's mobile team, which initially produced some buzzy hits like the Yahoo Weather app and Yahoo News Digest, along with more prosaic updates of core Yahoo features like fantasy sports and email. Yet Ms Mayer largely failed in her quest to make Yahoo a "daily habit" for more users in online video, search and messaging. Ms Mayer also made a bold bet on social media, buying the money-losing blogging site Tumblr for $US1.1 billion in 2013. But she did little with the acquisition and was eventually forced to write down much of the purchase price. One of her biggest mistakes was hiring a former colleague from Google, Henrique de Castro, to be chief operating officer and oversee Yahoo's advertising efforts. But Ms Mayer fired him just 14 months later, resulting in a $US58 million severance payout. All told, he received about $US108 million, according to court documents. Two lawsuits have sought to recover some of that money, arguing that Ms Mayer and the board overpaid him and failed to protect shareholders' interests. Ms Mayer, who oversaw search at Google, also assigned more than 1000 people to Yahoo's search products, which it had largely abandoned in 2009 when it sold its search operations to Microsoft. The team was asked to pursue her great white whale: a personalised search product that could leapfrog Apple's Siri, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. Little came of the effort. Yahoo's board recognized Ms Mayer's failure to meet business targets and docked her bonuses and stock awards in four of the five years she was in charge. But under terms of her original employment agreement, it also granted her new shares annually, easing the sting. The biggest financial price she paid for her mistakes came this year, when she gave up her cash bonus for 2016 and equity awards for 2017 — about $US14 million — as a penalty for management's failure to act on evidence of the theft of data from 500 million accounts in 2014. That incident, along with the 2013 breach of one billion accounts, prompted Verizon to renegotiate its original purchase agreement with Yahoo, shaving $US350 million from the $US4.83 billion price. Even Ms Mayer's handling of the Alibaba investment came in for second-guessing. Yahoo spent so much time devising its original plan to spin off the stake in a tax-free transaction that the Internal Revenue Service changed its views on such deals, forcing the company to start over. So, was she ovepaid? Given those missteps, was Ms Mayer overpaid? "For the existing amount of compensation, could Yahoo shareholders have done better?" Mr Wieser of Pivotal Research said. "Or for the same outcome, could they have paid less? Ultimately it's a hard question to answer." Peter Monaco, who was a vice president for engineering at Yahoo for three years before leaving for Facebook last September, said Ms Mayer does not get enough credit for transforming Yahoo's culture. "She eliminated the dead wood, drove out the politics, put in place compensation policies that rewarded high achievers and energised people to create great products again," he said. Arguably, Yahoo was unfixable. The company's DNA and technology were built around its original identity as a web portal — a powerful position in the early 2000s but increasingly outmoded in the mobile era, as apps and phone platforms like iOS and Android became the gateways to the internet. "Given the hand she was dealt, I doubt anyone could have done a better job transforming the culture and making Yahoo healthy again," Mr Monaco said. Ms Mayer, who once made the gruelling trek to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, said last year that fixing Yahoo was like climbing a mountain. "It's a tall mountain to climb and we started, obviously, very low on the mountain," she told Charlie Rose. Unlike Kilimanjaro, though, the Yahoo challenge proved insurmountable.

Weekend poll: How many photos are synced to your Google Photos account? David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/06/04 3:44pm PDTJun 4, 2017 120 Plus 1 on G+ 202 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares366 Applications Polls The Google account dashboard is a pretty cool way to see what's going on with your Google account, and the last time we ran a poll utilizing stats from it, we asked you how many apps Google thought you'd installed to your various devices. This week, we're doing Google Photos. To see how many Photos are synced to your Google Photos account, just head to https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard and scroll down until your see the entry for Photos, as shown below. So, how many photos are synced to your account? I'm at a little over 8,000 at this time, and that honestly doesn't seem like a lot to me (my Lightroom catalog contains over twice as many). I'll be curious to see how many of your break into the five-figure ranges. How many photos are on your Google Photos account? Under 100 100-999 1,000-2,499 2,500-4,999 5,000-9,999 10,000-19,999 20,000-39,999 More than 40,000. View Results  Loading ... Tags google+ photos photos sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Boolean Corporation the trick is to plug your iPhotos Library to the desktop uploader and see the magic happen. I have my Canon and SONY photos up there as well. ZettabyteGamer 6,002 photos Jes Marwaha 3.5k, since like 2014ish rndusrnm479461 Surprised that mine rose to 23k. Used to be 15k not long ago. Liam Clifford 17,017 Iwanova > 7k photos backup from blackberry until now yippiedad 78,693 Danyel Gustavo Just copy/paste of the question I made to another user: does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Barron Roth Yes, I've got 500k in Google Photos and it can be unbearably slow. makapav 55K and no it's not slow for me on my Pixel XL or Chrome on Windows. Danyel Gustavo I currently have 5k photos from my phone uploaded. I was thinking about uploading all my 15k photos taken with my camera. Alvar Lagerlof That will be no problem Michael Zinfandel Rork Not in the slightest. Hardly any of those are on my phone, and when on the web it's purely cloud based so it only loads what you are looking at. There is absolutely no lag from having more images in Google Photos. Level380 at 55k its not slow at all, searching is still fast. yippiedad Nope, I haven't noticed any lag. Victoria I have 15500 photos backed up and it's not slow in the least, still blazing fast. icethegreat 40k woohoo vmxr lower than 10 lol Liam Spradlin 55,207 photos 👀 vmxr are you trying to map the world 👀 Calvin Mccoy I get the job done from comfort of my home, with the help of hassle-free gigs that only takes from you a Desktop computer system in addition to web connection and I am also pleased than before... After half a year with this career and therefore i obtained cash in sum Thirty six Thousand us dollars... Ordinarily I make up approximate to eighty bucks/h and work for three to four hours every single day.And excellent point about this task is the fact that you can supervise time and effort whenever you work and for just how long as you may like and you attain a paycheck weekly........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Boolean Corporation 57,382... noob. :P Boolean Corporation The creepy thing is that it has recognized photo locations without having GPS data in my camera photos. Robert Porter If you have Google maps tracking your location it can go off of that too vidvox That was the craziest thing about using my DSLR on a trip through Texas last year, looking at the photos online and seeing the correct GPS location on them! Tyler Humphreys My mom had some pictures of Siberia, California and Google Photos thought they were from Russia, just from an album named "Siberia". chacalau 62,000 ish keltypack I have over 66,800 photos on Google Rob 54,857..... Both of you beat me! :P Đức Thành I feel small on here with just under 48.600 photos. But to be fair, my Nexus 5's relatively mediocre camera does diminish the frequency of my photo-taking whims a bit. I feel like this would be a different story if I had something like the Pixel or Nexus 6P, or even the Nexus 5X instead. LightofHonor Beat me. 50,866 smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245 Jerry Suppan Wow!　And I thought I had too many at 51,000+. Well, I guess we can store our entire life from birth if if we include pre-digital era scanned photos. (^J^) Đức Thành That is a creepy thought but somehow I find it kind of exciting as well. Imagine storing all of our memories, thoughts and emotions on the cloud. Victor A backup of met-art archives? 😁 Danyel Gustavo Does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Liam Spradlin Doesn't seem to make the app lag. Of course if I scroll back a really long way it'll take a sec for the photos to all load in, but otherwise things seem fine. Teja How to check the exact count? Luqmaan Mathee "To see how many Photos are synced to your Google Photos account, just head to https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard and scroll down until your see the entry for Photos, as shown below." It's in the article. Teja Oops, missed that. Its 51,929 photos. :D Carl Draper Photos does not appear for me on that page Margaritas Ante Porcos omg! are breaking films into frames and then upload? lol Kenni Odelheim I said 20-40 as a guess, but it was 46k I found out afterwards... jesus man.. I snap alot :D sssgadget ~15000 Booyabobby 3075 Paul_Werner 26,263 photos currently dcdttu 47,793. I used the photos uploader on my desktop. Lexxior what happens if you do? dcdttu It uploads pictures. Jorim Tielemans 78,533 photo's, that's only 3 times the amount of my bookmarks 🤐 maybe that would be a cool poll for next weekend. Lexxior wtf 20000+ bookmarks?! Wis Zero. makapav My condolences. matteventu 1543. I'm not a big shooter. But I don't understand how they count "Albums"... I'm sure I don't have 464 albums lol (just 4-5 actually). Antoine Martin Every link you share creates a hidden album nagi 71,234... yes, I shoot a lot. Nathaniel V Stupid question. Why is the album count so high? I think I've only got about 40 albums. Ruddock's looks the same... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b938bcf21775e44a09d96b5f066996b5222174f26d73027381a6cbf127a6ce8.png Sean It probably includes the auto-generated "this day x years ago" albums and such Lars Jeppesen Also I think it includes "shared" stuff makapav All those Hangouts albums from Picasaweb in the background that are probably hidden in Google Photos. Morten Ulv Yep, this is the correct answer. You could see them in Picasaweb. One for each day. Tomáš Petrík I have almost that many albums with less than half the photos. Bryan Mine says 577 albums, but if i click the arrow to expand it, it only shows 3 (which is correct) Hexlattice Yeah, it makes a shared album every time you share even just one photo with a person... Kinda why I prefer sharing a photo via Hangouts or some other means. I don't like the clutter it makes in my albums. senor_heisenberg Under a thousand. whispy_snippet 11,049 Dominic Labbé Well.... 99042... 😮 Got my first digital camera in December 1999. BigTurk Beat me by almost 2000! I got my first digital camera in 2002. Kudos to you haha Richard Riker 13,148 Shaunak Guharay 18,679 . I expected it to be somewhere around 5000, but holy shit JW 12k Joshua Ferguson 61K, I've slowed down over the last couple of years Simps 11,222 photo's and 959 albums that I have not created. Boolean Corporation Also, people like to share their sites with me... it appears... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fbf6c5a8bcd2762fb0751916cddfc1c30c07e67b2f9bc325f16d5e39a091d222.png Stoffers I've also had 1,648,103 shared with my 2 sites. Boolean Corporation So it must be the total amount of public Google Sites out there. Dn Bro I have 8,973,294...I'm not really sure where they are. exadeci https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3db3521ceda62f5bd4e638a39d5ae74f7f04e770dc7485d7a198f8b445df4f99.png Anand Slightly higher than your count ;). What are these sites??? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/be13189cca9396d4e74c49fdc6aecbbbd4492ec5084d30989724d23a522efbbe.png Captain_Invisible 8.973.487 here 😲 Andrew Bone Just beat you 😉 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/707765784503bfaf20d2fe1327e82cdb628e443e39d108a823b2ddff6dd7e04f.png Roderick Gadellaa 8,973,436 :P Vasilj Milošević Nearly 4M over here. WTF? Where are those sites? Anthony https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a438430be5924c8714c16e394b9f093c1241bebf635d0d22be1752a0267c8d77.png Cheesespix Not a single :) I don't save my photos online. Corey Kinard Here, have a 🍪 Phil Miller Do you hide them under your mattress? BigTurk 97,222 :O Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher I don't have Photos listed! But I estimate around 250,000-300,000 photos. Makes Photos on my phone practically unsuable, somehow Google Photos insists keeping all thumbnails in internal memory which takes up 2-3GB of space. Photos uses up all the battery of my phone if I enable the app :-( dsDoan All of my photos are synced with Google Photos, but I don't take many photos, so it's under 1,000. Jason Brian Chapa 35,445 Maxr1998 Only slightly above 2500 pictures, that's​ everything I took in the last five years. I don't take many pictures, but that's also because I'm very selective with my images - I remove most "duplicates"/alternative photos which aren't that good and only keep the best images. Bryan How does the album count work? I've only made 3 albums but it says i have 577 albums. App Shah 65K + https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4077abf057824ff03b40189ea40058cc9fdea8e6160c0bcbde23fbeaaac30a52.png Martins Nkem I've got over 2200 photos mostly photos from my picasa album and photos i uploaded to Google drive about 3 years ago. I prefer not to use cloud storage for photos any more. Richard Markert Under 100, lol. Try under 10. I don't use Photos. VAVAMk_2 Over 1700...I need to take more photos I guess. Laurentiu 27,809 SchmilK EnHaggen Just under 200,000 photos over here. Took 6 days to upload my entire photo library via desktop app. Everything I've shot with my DSLR and phones over the past 13 years. Phil Miller 42 photos a day? Do you even have time to sleep? SchmilK EnHaggen I shoot a lot of bursts, plus it's a mix of me, my wife, and my 2 kids phones all synching to the same account (granted the oldest is only 7, but she has been know to take 42 pictures of a TV show lol) Vasilj Milošević 52.832 photos 3.784 albums :D Image upload bugs for me on disqus, so here's imgur link: http://imgur.com/a/qY6gw Jeffrey Heesch Only 7,770 for the time being, but I just recently got myself a DSLR, so I'm expecting my Google storage to hurt in the near future. Mr Wright 64,616 all nudes 😎 Dmitry Stepanushkin about 30000. Nudes will stay on local storage 😁 cadtek91 I don't think the Album counts are accurate. Lord Argyris 2,925 here. Everything since I got my Nexus 7 on December 31st, 2013, which is when I officially joined the Android ecosystem. I'm curious, where is the Sites statistic some people have posted? I can't seem to find that anywhere on my account dashboard. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f18afe5301756a2f37e6f449c2faf0ec975cf47ead995985d6cf0ee4cb56fe1c.png tapsboy 10,351 JG 64,884... With another 1,940-some waiting to upload as I type (literally just got back from an extended data-light/less vacation where I was the unofficial group photographer). A lot of the pics (especially from this trip) are burst shots. Trying to photograph something as we drove by so I just let it go to get the most tree-less pic... Or to make an animation or panorama pic. That, and of course, cat pics :) Hey, if Google is going to give me free unlimited storage... Might as well take advantage. Bryan Kolb Just under 200,000... Dre 44,153 Kevin Sword "Wekeend" poll? Guess so! 9,179 photos. Phil Miller 19,268. For my 20k photo, it will be a pick of my friend Harry Johnson. Akilesh Akil https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b22006051777d76bece05eecfcae428cdcf2381379fdc6e701e6c4f64988671.jpg Barron Roth I feel like I'm an edge case, Google Photos runs very slow for me 😔 an old screenshot, I probably broke 500k these days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d2363f77f2556cf6b91ee1f158be42694f8fcb74f9869a02f388dddcdc95e383.png Rob What are all those photos? Is your porn collection included in that number? Kidding ;) Your comment about the service being slow is odd, it should only load what you're looking at and not everything. But perhaps something goes wrong when the number is so high. Barron Roth I'm a photographer, so it shouldn't be too unusual! It's slow mostly during search or scrolling through historical dates. uthark 107,383 Dlang123 Photos ‌124,910 tu3218 If I upload photos to google photos that wasn't taken on my phone, will they be analyzed and sorted correctly by their date, location ,etc. Assuming all this data is attached to the file. Robert Porter Yes, any photo on Gphotos is analyzed. If they don't have the locations, I believe Google fills that info with your Google maps location during that time. HSidhu 000064 Photos :) Victor %01000000 David Zero smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245. I have it sync with my PC, and all my DSLR pics get uploaded Justin Osborne 15k, but probably half of those just since I got the Pixel, due to our first baby. Over 20GBs of HQ pics/video since then. Michael Zinfandel Rork 70,503 Level380 55K and counting. Leandro Brandão 10132. I backed up some old photos and used the photo scan app to scan others, maybe 100 or 200 photos. I use google photos since my first android phone in 2012, i was amazed how that worked back then, now is even better. Joshua Talley Pretty sure I saw over 100k several months ago... codingismy11to7 17k, in original quality... and I've recently been thinking about uploading my 90+ GBs of stuff from before gphotos existed... Willie Chalmers III I am definitely in the minority with only 2,140 photos. What do you people take pictures of? b_boogey_xl I've got like 25k photos but if I remember correctly, this isn't just Google Photos but any photo you have uploaded to Google across their many services, including Hangouts, Google+ Messager, Google Voice, Google+, Picasa, etc… I believe if you go to your About Me page you can see all the "albums" and photos you've ever uploaded to those Google services (not including Google Photos). Mike in KC 457. Guess I'm not much of a photographer... Saqib What is maximum free storage allowed with Google photos? tehboogieman They say unlimited for compressed images Miku is Best Vocaloid 10000 and counting Joshua Worth 83,689 😊 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ef968361c0424a651500b83acdd44d4fa19466201c00685b3a584e99d0e40e77.jpg Sherrie B 297,771 Daniel Rodriguez Looks like I've taken a picture or two in my time... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/505b72e38a4d6a15ced01c270253dc58d8777887f0c273491675ea1e322be65e.png Morten Ulv Jesus. What are all those photos of? You take hundreds of photos every day? I take maybe 10 000 per year of my kids, so that's a modest average of ~30 per day. Andrew Bone ~95% selfies 😉 Daniel Rodriguez Oh god, not if I can help it. No one needs to see that much of me. abc He takes a pic of every meal he's ever eaten. Daniel Rodriguez .. guilty as charged. Daniel Rodriguez Hah, actually, I'm definitely an edge case with an unusual situation: I have a little 'lifecam' thing that takes pictures every 30 seconds that I use when traveling around, so it generates thousands and thousands of pictures when using it. The company that makes it recently went under, and so the service they offered where they hosted the pics it took went down- I downloaded my pics before it went down, and uploaded them to Google Photos, all in the Unlimited storage when letting Google compress them (which is fine, the vast majority aren't high quality anyway). So far, no issues with it, Google claims unlimited storage when you use their compression, and, numbers above showing, they mean it. create812 Google is in an intense meeting now, discussing how to handle "whales" like you. Daniel Rodriguez Hey, they promise unlimited storage if using their 'high quality' compression, I'm just taking them up on the offer! Francisco Peña they gonna throttle you from taking any more pictures. Daniel Rodriguez I'm actually curious if they will, I upload tens of thousands at a time when I travel thanks to my lifecam, and so far haven't run into any issues or gotten any alerts. I tell the client to upload them using the Google 'high quality' compression, for which they offer unlimited storage if you use it, and so far, they've been as good as their word. Definitely not doing anything that's against terms of service, all falls within the service's promised offer, so if they did throttle me, I'd love to know why. There's a big difference between 'unlimited' and 'unlimited as long as you don't go over 50,000 photos' or something like that. Artem Russakovskii Around 35k for me. Dennis 64.498 - ich speichere mittlerweile ausschließlich dort.. ast00 3342. I guess I don't take many pictures. Roderick Gadellaa Somehow Photos doesn't show up for me in that list. It's supposed to be above Play Music, right? It shows Payments there for me. Weird? vwnut13 I'd have more, but they are in a "brand account" attached to my Gmail. Still accessable online, but no longer in the Android app. Thanks for breaking, then removing that feature Google. Trent 25,525 it was very low prior to getting my Nexus 5X when that and Local Guides launched. The Pixel has raised it somewhat, but getting my DSLR and traveling fairly often (only 8 countries so far this year, but about that many again planned up until December) to take pictures and backing up my RAW files along with JPEGs has made a big difference. Peter World Citizen I love cats. I've just over 5k of photos of pussies. Plus another 2k of food and cars/bikes. Jan-Lk Else Where's the no option? Javier180 Simply dont vote. McClain S https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4911bca160a898e3d9f1f092a2af15587d485f0ca9ef12ceb21637dcd00bd2a6.png Arvid Over a 100.000 photos. I did upload everything I have, including older ones I scanned and our Family archive (going back to 1960) Wilson I'm running out of storage :O Victor 4982 albums and 246688 photos. Everything since 1996 on my Amiga till now, where every picture received or taken with the phone gets automatically baked up. Erik 41000 for now. I hope AI will improve so I can find what I'm looking for. It would be nice not to get pictures of cats when I search for dogs, buses and cameras when I search for cars and picture frames when I search for computers for example. Oh, and face recognition is still not available in Europe. I guess Google doesn't want to upset EU more than they already have. Rob I have face recognition in Europe. Not sure how I did, but it's fairly easy to activate it. I think by a single-time usage of VPN and reset app data. Have had it ever since. Alenekbell Google is paying 97$ per hour!

James 53,235 so far. I have had a hard drive failure and if it wasn't for them being backed up, theses photo s would have been lost. sasu85 Backup in Google compressed resolution or at full resolution? Do you have also other backup (like hard drive?) Or not? James It just so happens that my pics are 12mp or less and I believe that is the restriction that Google has set. Many of my pictures are scanned pictures from old photos and every smart phone I owned (I always had them backed up). I do have them on my hard drive, but have actually been rethinking this as I see no benefit from having on my hard drive. Just 440. Removed all after switching from Nexus 5 to Pixel, and will do so after switching from my Pixel to something else. mcored Photos ‌66,423 Tom Daley settings say 7700 same folder on my server says 20000+ Hmmmm not sure whats happening there Timothy Vreeland 38k, so close to moving up in the poll bracket.

I really do not take many photos, most of what I do take is used for online sales or confirmation photos, so they get deleted after the transaction. Another large number is having info from hardware at work so I can enter it into a database when I get back to my desk. Again those get deleted once that data is entered. Alfonso Surroca 8K, and that's including the fact that I synced like 15 years of photographs from my desktop computer to my Photos account. abc This is more of a "how many photos do you take" question than a Google Photo question. benmarvin 16,405. And I don't even take that many pictures. Some of my photos go all the way back to Picasa days Indefinite Implosion Yep 15,608 and a lot are from before I had a smartphone/from my DSLR when I had a smartphone. Brandon I've got just over 5k, which is less than many people here but is pretty much every photo I've taken in the last 12-ish years. I try to remember to back up to my external hard drive now and again just in case, but otherwise Google is the only thing I use for photo storage, management, or editing. James Miller My wife takes pictures of our 5 boys daily with our DSLR. Whenever I put them on our NAS drive, I have them automatically backed up using the desktop backup client. I'm up to 116,053, but that number grows by about 1000 every couple of weeks. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a6190002ab404d0e7e513fe45d2931f9173bc76ab04c9c6bfc6167f5e961b10a.jpg Deb Newman I quit using google photo because my account got hacked and googles recovery system wouldn't verify it was me even though I knew most of the answers to their questions, finally got to speak to someone from tech support and still would not verify.

Kostas 💪🎩 Any way to put photos to a special place separate from the others, that aren't in your face all the time? Abhimanyu Seth Just 44,672 photos till now! philopek each as he likes but then i think the question is not very specific hence the answer doesn't provide much else than a sheer number. if the question had been "self made and unique images" that would have provided a more useful picture. while there certainly are photographers, selfie addicts and the likes, i know how many years it takes to produce a few 10'000 images of notworthy quality and uniqueness because i'm producing photos for the last 45 years now, all digitalized and stored safely, and at the times the pace of production was insanely high and still one gets' nowhere near some of the numbers that have bee mentioned here. further what are all the folks doing once google will drop a platform entirely. i remember that i have changed platform due to changes made by apple and/or google which is why all my images are now structred in simple folders and subfolders, storable and managable on every computer cross platform, no matter what some may decide. when apple changed from iphoto to photos for example most features were missing and to continue watching the library on apple-tv one had to purchase software without knowing whether it would meet requirements etc. i would like to know how many of those images are self-made and more or less unique, everything else is just claiming bragging rights IMO Ozl yeah, i will triple my photos and videos by the end of the year when i get the New Pixel Phone xD (hoping it still has that unlimited upload) Chris Foote 139,750.

Pro tip: Put Google Photos on your computer. If you're on vacation and you have Wi-Fi at the hotel, but Google Photos on your laptop. When you check in at the hotel, plug your phone up and copy/move all the photos over.

Years later, that foggy feeling that I spent so much time taking photos that I don't remember the vacation at all? And when you do have some time to sit down and reminisce, going through thousands of snaps feels exhausting, and there is too much emphasis on quantity of snaps than QUALITY? (I used to snap away 30+ pics a day on average, now cut it down to 5-6, keeping the phone away during events to actually enjoy the moment) Horacio Gómez 66.333 photos.

[Update: Fixed] It's not just you—there's a widespread Google Home outage Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 12:04pm PDTJun 5, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares53 Google Google Home News Update 1: 2017/06/05 12:10pm PDT Fixed Google spent a lot of time at I/O talking about Assistant and Google Home. In fact, it gave a free Home to everyone who attended I/O. Today, a lot of those devices are spitting out errors instead of controlling smart home devices and answering questions. According to multiple online complaints, there's a Google Home outage affecting a significant portion of users. You'll know instantly if your Home is affected. Use the trigger phrase and it'll respond with "Hmm, something went wrong. Try again in a few seconds," or "There was a glitch. Try again in a few seconds." Most users say the issues started popping up in the last day or two—I began getting errors last night, and today Google Home has a nearly 100% failure rate. Interestingly, this seems to only affect Google Home. Other devices with Assistant work fine, so you can still control your devices if you've got a phone handy. Some owners report a hard reset of Home fixed the issue, but many others still have problems after resetting. Google is aware of the outage, so it'll probably be fixed soon. It's pretty annoying in the meantime, though. Update 1: 2017/06/05 12:10pm PDT Fixed Google has updated the thread to say all issues have been addressed. If you still have problems, try restarting.

Glad AP said something. I was considering returning it to the store. I had just got the device yesterday and thought it was normal behavior. Calvin Mccoy I get the job done from ease and comfort of my property or home, with simplistic gigs that solely demands from you a Laptop or desktop pc as well as online connection and I am just more successful than before... After six months time during this task and therefore i obtained remunerated totally 36 thousand usd... Mainly I acquire just about eighty bucks/hr and also work for 3 to 4 hours on a regular basis.And wonderful thing relating to this job is usually that you can organize time period when you do the job and for how much time as you prefer and you attain a paycheck a week.----->>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm glad I got an Echo instead of that air freshener. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9e084adc03d0c0fe4e62615255f95376c0df7f936c6bd8c9b188e814dfa71c29.gif Luckbuckets I wanted to disagree with your choice of the echo but that gif. but the snark over the top. awesome. Duder12 Hows that multi user support working out? Daniel Yeah, using Bing must be awesome Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Actually, I added an "Ask Google" skill, and I never use it. That's how useful I find googling with an Echo. Dave Stines I have both. My wife uses the echo for music in the kitchen at this point. Echo can't hear half of what I say. Home responds so much better I only use it now. Plus the info you get. I use it constantly. I have a very smart home. Lights, sprinkler system, etc tu3218 Air freshener or not, at least it looks like it belongs in a home. Echo belongs in a garage. abc A comment with 13 upvotes ranks lower than the top comment which has only 4 upvotes. One can imagine how many butthurt Google fanboys must have downvoted this comment. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All of them. ericshmerick How's the sodium level of that snack? Salty? Salty. Jay It has been a very annoying couple of days. My whole house runs on my Google home. Lights, temperature, TV, music. Having to use 6 different apps again sucks. RyanWhitwam You can use Assistant on your phone, right? Jay Yeah, but when I say ok Google, the Google home takes over as well and it starts speaking loudly and the assistant on my phone listens to home and it's a mess. RyanWhitwam Ah yes, the age-old problem. I just use the long-press on my phone now. Trigger word is for Home only. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Jay I'm going to start using the long press a lot more often. Tyler Hardeman you could, you know, just unplug the google home for now until things resolve themselves. Jay It's not that big of a deal, just annoying. Besides, it's Google they usually fix most problems within a day at most. Like I said I still have the standalone apps for myself, the rest of my family is going to have to deal with it for the time being. Ramon Restart it Jay Ive tried that a few times already icyhotmike When's the last time you tried? Jay About 5 minutes ago. Ramon Just restart the Google Home via the Home app, I'm back up since last night. Duder12 Didn't work for me obk88 didnt work for me either Jared H. I've factory reset 3 times. Helps for a few minutes to a few hours before reoccurring. Glad AP posted this or I'd have probably done something drastic.... Christopher Young Thank for you helping ensure my sanity. I've restarted both of my Google Homes, reset my router with no results. Justin Dybedahl Same here. I just bought one and hooked it up 15 minutes ago. Been driving me nuts. Lol yentrog31 Glad I really don't use it for anything really useful. So far just a gimmick since my shopping doesn't list in my Keep anymore. It's great for telling you the time or the weather though! Jakob Emerick They moved it without telling anybody. Your shopping list is tucked away in Google Express now. Noble My home has had only 15% success rate for a full week at least, its so annoying when it can't control your lights! James Briano It's an annoying product. I finally took mine out of the box when the folks who gifted it to me were coming for a visit. The most appropriate thing it's ever done was play "You Can't Always Get What You Want" on Play Music when I asked it to play the "Transparent" soundtrack on Spotify. Trolled so hard. B2discus I restarted it. It works when I cast to it. If I talk to it, the phone picks up and drops off the connection. VAVAMk_2 Mine is working Ruperto17 This has been happening to me for at least 2-3 weeks. The failure rate is about 70%. Its driving me nuts!! Spencer I've been having the same issue. I'm considering switching it from my 5Ghz network to my 2.4Ghz just to see if that makes a difference... Adam Cain I had this happen earlier today. A power cycle resolved the issue for me. Jon Fridman Google keeps telling me to try again every other command. I thought my Google Home was having connectivity issues at first, now I'm glad it's a known issue. russjr08 Mine is working fine, though I wasn't happy when the OTA update came through at 2AM and caused it to play the startup chime. Curtis Bond So this is what worked for me. Every time I used the hot-phrase it would spit out the same error, but once my wife used the hot-phrase, it started working perfectly. After that neither of us had issues. I'm pretty sure it's a software problem that's related to voice recognition. Also, big ups to AP for posting this. If Google is going to be serious about consumer electronics, they've got to stay on top of nonsense like this. A widespread failure like this should be unacceptable, and frankly should have been fixed already. Kyle Kepner I have five Google homes and 3 of them are wonky right now. Resets did not help ericshmerick Resetting will do nothing. It's a problem with ~the cloud~ LondonLeedsFan Is this feature available in the UK? Bruce Wayne And we want to trust these people to drive our cars autonomously. LOL. YuCMi Wouldn't it just chill your spine to hear your car saying, "Hmmm, something went wrong," while on a busy expressway? Đức Thành If you ever consider writing a script for a horror movie, please know that I'd like to read it and direct its movie. Just saying. YaKillaCJ I would rather have Wayne Tech JD Seeing as how they had Real life RC-able atomic powered cars in 1966 and a fully automatic self driving voice controlled car by 1989 I approve. DJ JoJo I was able to get mine working by going into home app, clicking upper right devices button. Next to Google home pic was "ready for multi user" prompt. I clicked it and trained my voice and it's working with no problems now. I had already power cycled and rebooted but that didn't work until I clicked on prompt. Defenestratus it didn't work for me for literally 3 minutes. Then it worked again. abc To be fair, it's a beta product. Bugs can happen. :) SunnyStroker Yep, that's Google! Always half Baked, always in Beta. Daniel Including Android right? I think we can cut them some slack considering how many things they give us for free. JD Its not free You are the product #productception KSubedi Almost returned mine because of that because I thought mine was defective unit. drkarlp I had mine for 9 months....I think it happened once - I re booted and all was fine. I love Google Home ! ericshmerick Wow...a positive poster. Everything okay? Garrett Johnson Fun fact. Holding the Microphone off button for 15 will do a factory data reset. According to Google's help center page you can not do a FDR from the app. Only reboot. That being said it didn't fix it for me Lars Jeppesen No issues on my GHomes located in Denmark and Brazil. Maybe a US only thing? John "OK Google, add HomePod to my shopping list." "Umm, something went wrong." ericshmerick All 3 of mine have been instantly throwing an error when I say "Hey Google." Been going on for a few days. Maddening. Markg55 All fixed. That was quick. JD My echo is working just fine thx JD Must have something to do with the prep for their Canadian launch... #blamecanada Frawlz Mine is still bugging out.

Amazon may launch 'Ice' smartphones in India running Android with Google services Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 11:17am PDTJun 5, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 Amazon News Rumors Amazon famously misread the market when it launched the Fire Phone in 2014 without any Google apps. Scarcely a year later Amazon had abandoned the device in the face of minuscule sales figures. Now, it's rumored to be prepping a new smartphone, but unlike the Fire Phone, this one will apparently run a version of Android with Google services. The report claims Amazon will brand these new phones as "Ice," and they will ship with Android 7.1.1. That means they'll have Google Assistant out of the box. Alexa support isn't as clear, but I'd be shocked if Amazon didn't add that. The Ice phone will also have the Play Store and all the apps that come with it. The first of these phones might launch in India by the end of the year, perhaps as a trial before shipping the phone in other markets. This would be an inexpensive phone with modest specs including a 5.2-5.5-inch screen, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, a 13MP camera, and a Snapdragon 435. Amazon is currently planning on a price of Rs 6,000 (roughly $93), but that could change by the time it launches. Well, if it launches.

Bruce Wayne From Fire to Ice. Not so subtle. Daniel 'Cause when Amazon made their last phone, all they did was get burned. XD NexusKoolaid And what did they do with all those unsold Fire phones they had stockpiled? They put 'em on ice. Daniel And what a bummer for them; they really had a burning desire to sell a bunch of them NexusKoolaid But in the end, they just decided to chill out. Daniel Bet you don't get these kind of comments on other websites. lol 4Ui812 She's sun and rain , She's fire and ice , a little crazy but it's nice , and when she gets mad best to leave her alone Daniel "You leave my wife outta this" -Jeff Bezos talking about his phone Lord Argyris Maybe they just like Pokemon? I expect they'll chain as many types that are super effective on the next in line as possible. Expect Flying, Bug and Psychic phones in the coming years. Or Dragon, Dragon, Dragon... MJ Here we go again... At least Amazon figured out it needs to have the Play Store. Pessimippopotamus Has anyone tried to make an E-Ink phone before aside from Yota? I feel like a smartphone that lasts several days with a b&w but very efficient screen would be right up Amazon's alley, especially considering its Kindle lineup, instead of a me-too low-end device. Marty Every e-ink device I've ever used was painfully slow. Unless e-ink can refresh at LCD rates, I don't see it being used as the primary display. Pessimippopotamus This is true. I feel like there's a bigger potential market in it as opposed to something like say... ...a phone with a 4-camera 3D system. 4Ui812 Amazon is taking a page from Microsoft. But I'm telling you ... don't discount MS. That beast is slowly waking up. Marty Agreed. MS will eventually finally have the world's best smartphone...long after the industry and the market has moved onto other things. 😋 4Ui812 No. Microsoft is moving back into software. Hardware was never their forte nor their bread and butter. T4rd I actually thought the opposite; their hardware is pretty solid IMO, esp. their newer tablets and laptops. In the mobile arena, software is definitely what's holding them (and other OEMs from using their software) back. Đức Thành Yup, their hardware isn't something I'd complain about as much as I'd complain about the software. There are times I'd just like to swear at my Windows 10 PC while I'd very seldom do that if at all to my precious Chromebook. T4rd Seems like they're still on their way to sleep right now.. https://seekingalpha.com/news/3271314-microsoft-rolled-os-update-bricked-windows-phones. I'm sure MS will return at some point; if anyone has the resources to brute force the mobile market (again), it's MS. But yeah.. it's going to be a while still.

Jason King How can Amazon sell both a device with Google Services and their Fire tablets? I thought Google Services was all-in-one? MJ It's a PHONE that will have Android and Google services on it. What's the confusion? Google Services agreements are per device... Jason King In the past, members of the Open Handset Alliance were prohibited from making any non-Google approved devices (ie: forked) from a company level, not a device level. It's why Acer had to pull out of the alternate Android OS that Alibaba created called Aliyum a few years ago, but that may have changed more recently. Amazon Fire was determined to be a 'fork' of Android which leads me to believe Google wouldn't allow Google Play Services on any Amazon device. MadMartigan That requirement is placed upon members of the OHA. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to get a device GMS licensed. Therefore, Amazon can do it. Acer cannot. Jason King ahhh - that's the difference then. Thanks for the clarification. Roger Siegenthaler What's the source of that information? Because Google would probably love to know seeing as this exact problem is the basis of their massive monopoly lawsuit in the EU. MadMartigan First: The basis for the EU lawsuit is that OEMs cannot sell Google Play Store compatible devices without Chrome, Google Search, and all the other GMS core apps installed. GMS licensing requires all GMS core apps be installed. Some oems would like to ship devices with Google Play store, but without the core GMS apps. Second: My source is common knowledge and deductive reasoning. Cyanogen, Inc was not a member of the OHA. Xiaomi is not a member of the OHA. Both sell (or sold) GMS devices. Xiaomi also sells non-GMS devices. Conclusions: You can sell GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Cyanogen, Inc.). You can sell non-GMS devices and GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Xiaomi). You can not sell devices with an incompatible fork of Android while a member of the OHA (Acer). Roger Siegenthaler ok; first point is wrong. That's only part of the lawsuit. And your only example that proves you to be correct is false as Xiaomi can only sell non-GMS devices within China; famously exempt from the GMS rules for ALL OEMs. RedPandaAlex Wait... don't they need to join the open handset alliance in order to do this? And doesn't that prohibit them from putting out devices without Google (like the Kindles)? MJ You are the second person who has said this... Where is this coming from? Samsung puts out phone(s) with Tizen on it. Stephen Sharp You can't put out what Google calls an "incompatible fork". This is how they put a stop to Aliyun Labrat Furthermore, if you sell one phone with an "incompatible fork" you can't sell any phone with Google Apps, at least, AFAIK. MadMartigan ...if you are a a member of the OHA. MJ What other phone does Amazon sell? YaKillaCJ They sell tablets and I wonder if the Fire Stick lineup could also violate. Im just curious whats the rules and stipulations. MadMartigan You cannot do this if you are a member of the OHA. If you are not a member, you can have your own Android and GMS Android. The OHA is what forbids that practice. Cael Tizen isn't a fork of Android. MJ Amazon Fire OS is... Rohan Tizen is a different OS while Acer and other using Alyun OS was a fork of android. The former is OK. Otherwise, companies like Samsung, LG would've had to stoop making laptops. MJ I guess you didn't read the whole discussion as someone else had the answer which is NOT your reasoning... Acer and Alyun were part of the Open Handset Alliance while Amazon is NOT. Why are you talking about laptops? LOL MadMartigan No. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to be GMS licensed. In fact, being a member of the OHA would expressly forbid them from doing this. Remember: Acer could not put out their non-GMS device because they were a member of the OHA, which is the body that forbids that sort of thing. vn33 Are they going to write a song about Fire and Ice then?? chromaniac It's going to be hard to compete against the likes of Xiaomi and Lenovo here in India. Flipkart tried and gave up. Micromax is still trying to make a comeback. Hrishikesh Bisen No it's not. At that price point and brand name of Amazon. chromaniac lol ok? MadMartigan Hey Ryan, The OHA/GMS issue seems to be confusing a lot of folks. Any chance AP could do a write up explaining this so people more clearly understand the differences/similarities? Kendall Seabury A phone of fire and ice. Designed by George R. R. Martin. Alvin Samsung's version of the fire phone was a little too literal. Andrew Bone Now just let us cast Amazon video 😉 Đức Thành I guess that one incident with the Fire Phone was enough to make Amazon reconsider its life choices and decide that it was time to grow up. Still, that was a long break that it took. The naming scheme is not bad but still kind of funny. Paul Monroe, Jr. Now if they could just do that with the fire tablets they might actually have something going on..

Gearhead episode one: the rise of AI assistants, Nokia's 3310 and Mark Ronson talks studio tech Gearhead episode one: the rise of AI assistants, Nokia's 3310 and Mark Ronson talks studio tech Podcast 3 days ago The announcement, made at the company's 2017 Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) today in San Jose, was one of the year's worst-kept tech secrets and was widely predicted. The device will retail at $349, come in white and space grey and will be available in the UK in December. The UK price will be announced later this year, although Apple did not say when. ADVERTISEMENT By comparison, the Google Home comes in at £129 and Amazon’s prime Alexa-powered device, Echo, is £150, with the Echo Dot available for just £50. Of Amazon's other Alexa-enabled devices, perhaps most anticipated is the Echo Show, its "hands-free camera and style assistant", with its 7-inch colour screen at $230 in the US (no UK release date is announced yet). Apple hopes its HomePod will rival the Amazon Echo, Google Home and the coming Essential Home. To make up ground on competitors, the HomePod will have a seven tweeter beamform array plus a subwoofer inside, besting the current audio tech on these rival devices. READ NEXT Behold Apple's new iPads: the 10.5-inch and 12.5-inch iPad Pro Behold Apple's new iPads: the 10.5-inch and 12.5-inch iPad Pro By Victoria Woollaston Despite delivering what could never be described as unerring responses, Amazon's Echo and Google's Home have still created a new market for voice recognition AI assistants designed specifically for the home. Subscribe to WIRED In an attempt to make it look like it is not following behind the pack and is, in fact, going its own way, Apple is trying to market the HomePod as a smart music system that just happens to also be able to answer spoken questions and commands thanks to the six on-board mics. It can additionally handle HomeKit duties by voice prompts or even remotely via the app. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Apple adds new MacBooks, iMacs and the 'all-powerful' iMac Pro Apple adds new MacBooks, iMacs and the 'all-powerful' iMac Pro By Victoria Woollaston Inside, the brains of the HomePod happen to be the same A8 chip that powers the iPhone, making the speaker one of the most powerful of its kind when it comes to market. Looking at the design of the HomePod, it has a 3D mesh outer shell and light display on the top to indicate when Siri is listening. Apple's marketing boss Phil Schiller previously hinted that the smart speaker would have a screen, commenting: "So there are many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations". It is something of a surprise, then, that the HomePod does not have an on-board display. The shipping date later this year means the HomePod comes out a full two years after Amazon launched Echo. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Apple's WWDC 2017 will return to San Jose in June Apple's WWDC 2017 will return to San Jose in June By Victoria Woollaston Going along with the typical Apple aesthetic, the HomePod is clearly meant to look high-end and expensive, with “excellent” sound quality thanks to those seven tweeters and subwoofer. Two HomePods can be linked to provide stereo pairing, which sets it somewhat against Sonos, while each 7-inch-tall speaker attempts, through some clever DSP, to split individual elements of a song to offer "spatial sound". The speaker will also work with your existing Apple Music subscription and have access to your music library and playlists. READ NEXT Apple WWDC 2016: iOS 10, Apple TV OS and Siri updates expected later today Apple WWDC 2016: iOS 10, Apple TV OS and Siri updates expected later today By Lee Bell Apple's AI assistant Siri was launched in 2011, and was not an instant hit - nor were original AI assistants on other platforms. However, consumers have found that talking to an assistant while on the move in the street is very different to interacting with a smart speaker in the home, which is how Amazon had such success with the Echo, shifting a reported 11 million devices by the end of 2016. Bolstering its support of this in-house AI assistant, as well as revealing the HomePod, Apple has launched a Siri-based watch face as part of watchOS4, describing it as "an intelligent proactive assistant right on your wrist" that "displays the information users need most throughout the day using Siri intelligence" such as traffic delay information to usual commutes. ADVERTISEMENT Alexa's popularity, despite its unreliability experienced by WIRED, is rooted in the fact that, thanks to opening up the system to third-party developers, it has more than 12,000 “Skills” that help users implement voice-activated smart home tech in their homes. Apple clearly hopes to win the AI-assistant race on the design front and by pitching this as a speaker, capitalising on the fact that it already has millions of devices in homes across the world, as well as its own home automation platform, HomeKit. It's the company's strong association with music that allows it to, initially at least, positioned the HomePod mainly as an AI-powered music speaker. Tim Cook said on introducing the device that Apple wants "to reinvent home music". They may well do this, but they also want a large slice of the home digital assistant market, despite coming to the party late.

The security patch is rolling out over-the-air and can also be downloaded directly if you’re not one for waiting. In addition to bolstering the security of its devices, Android Police points out that Google included a pretty important Pixel software fix in this update: a nasty bug that has resulted in some Pixel smartphones randomly freezing has supposedly been fixed. Well, hopefully. A post on Google’s product forums confirms that the fix “should address many of the freezing issues that have been reported.” Count me as one of the unlucky ones; my Pixel has been completely locking up at unpredictable times — at least once or twice a day — for months. And it rarely recovers or snaps out of it, so I usually have to hold down the power button for a hard reset whenever the freezes occur. (Yes, the Pixel’s camera is so good that it makes putting up with this stuff worth it.) Not all Pixel devices exhibit the issue. My colleague Vlad hasn’t encountered it at all, for example. I’m installing the OTA right now, so I’m trying to be optimistic that the freezing will vanish for good. But the company warns that “freezing and general device performance issues can be caused my many different things” so Google is encouraging users to report back on whether it truly alleviates the problem. Now if only Google could improve the Pixel’s Bluetooth performance...

Apple revealed HomePod, its Siri-powered smart speaker, during the company’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, according to CNET. But while consumers likely will view the device as the latest addition to a market currently dominated by Amazon and Google, Apple has bigger plans for its new product. Reportedly releasing in December for $349, HomePod will cost nearly twice as much as the Amazon Echo and almost three times as much as the Google Home, which cost $179 and $129, respectively. The reason for the higher price tag is Apple’s apparent emphasis on sound quality, something sorely lacking from Amazon’s products. “Just like with portable music, we want to reinvent home music,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said at WWDC. In addition to the various types of aid current smart speakers provide, HomePod features what Apple calls “spacial awareness,” which allows the device to sense room size and occupying furniture to adjust audio as needed, according to CNET. With the heavy focus on audio, HomePod appears positioned more to rival Bose and other similarly priced home speaker units. The fact that HomePod isn’t copying some of Amazon’s recent Echo updates seems to further support this notion, which was rumored by industry experts in the weeks leading up to HomePod’s reveal. Only time will tell, though, if the voices of Siri, Google and Alexa will be the soundtrack to our high-tech apocalypse.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Netflix's CEO Compares His Company to Facebook and Google What do these tech giants tell us about Netflix's international growth prospects? Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Jun 5, 2017 at 4:41PM Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) isn't exactly in the same business as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. Sure, Facebook and Google both do video, but Netflix is all about premium content. Nonetheless, CEO Reed Hastings thinks his company has the same mass appeal as both companies, and that bodes well for Netflix's international subscriber growth. "Most of our growth now is international," Hastings said at Re/Code's Code Conference. "We're about 50/50 in terms of memberships. And if you look at the big internet companies like YouTube and Facebook, they're 80%-85% international and 15% domestic. So we have a long way to go in international." Considering Netflix still believes it has a good amount of growth left domestically, the streaming service could be absolutely huge if Hastings' assertion is correct. Image source: Netflix. Just how international are Facebook and YouTube? Facebook is nice enough to break down its users by geographical territories. It lumps the U.S. in with its neighbor to the north, Canada, which combined to have 234 million users as of the end of last quarter. That's just 12.1% of Facebook's 1.94 billion users. That's an even smaller percentage than Hastings threw out in his conversation at Re/Code. Google isn't as forthcoming with YouTube statistics. According to research group Socialbakers, 80% of YouTube users come from other countries. That said, both Facebook and YouTube are free for users, generating revenue through advertisements. Netflix, however, requires subscribers to pay. Facebook and Google's domestic revenue split may give a better indication of what's attainable for Netflix. Last quarter, U.S. and Canadian users generated 49% of Facebook's revenue. Alphabet generated 48% of its revenue from the United States. Meanwhile, Netflix generated 58% of streaming revenue from the U.S. in the first quarter. So while Netflix does have some ground to make up internationally, it might not be as big of a gap as Hastings is indicating because of the lower average buying power of international Facebook and YouTube users. A better split may be closer to the 65/35 international-domestic subscriber split of HBO and Cinemax. Netflix is still growing domestically Surely, there's still a lot of growth left for Netflix -- both internationally and domestically. The company believes it can reach between 60 million and 90 million domestic subscribers in the long term. With 50 million members already, it may be just a couple more years before it reaches the bottom edge of that projection. And if it gets there that quickly, it bodes well for its continued growth up toward the top of the projection. The continued growth of Netflix's profitable domestic subscribers will provide Netflix with cash to fuel its international growth with new local originals. The company is investing aggressively around the world with new localized content, and it's had several modest international hits, such as 3% from Brazil. It's important to remember that Netflix is still only about a year and a half into many international markets. The customer ramp-up ought to be more accelerated than domestically because of better brand recognition and everything Netflix has learned over the past decade of domestic streaming. Still, it's going to take time for Netflix to fill out its catalog in every market with compelling originals and must-see licensed shows and films to give it the same mass appeal as it has in the United States. Even as domestic subscribers continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace than just a couple of years ago, international subscriber ought to outpace it for a long time to come. And if Netflix succeeds in reaching its long-term view, that means a lot more international subscribers have yet to sign up.

This means that Apple has placed an emphasis on audio quality, packing the speaker with an array of seven tweeters and a woofer as well as “spatial awareness” that detects its location in a room and adapts the output automatically. In announcing the HomePod, Apple CEO Tim Cook said there were many companies making products for enjoying music in the home but “none have nailed it yet”. He mentioned wireless speaker systems such as Sonos that “sound good but are not smart” and “other smart speakers” (presumably a reference to Amazon Echo and Google Home) that “don’t sound great”. “We want to combine this all,” he said. HomePod is controlled using Siri, the company’s voice-activated personal assistant, which has, according to Apple, been trained to be better at answering questions about music such as “Hey Siri, who’s the drummer in this?” “Apple reinvented portable music with iPod, and now HomePod will reinvent how we enjoy music wirelessly throughout our homes,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing. The device can also be used to send messages, get updates on news, sports and weather and control smart home devices connected using Apple’s HomeKit.

Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images At $349, it will be more expensive than Google Home ($109) and Amazon Echo ($179) but cheaper than the Sonos Play 5 ($499). The product will launch in the US, UK and Australia in December 2017 and in other markets in 2018. “I think it’s a very Apple-esque product in that it seeks to stake out the high end of a market with its technology, price and positioning,” said analyst Paul Erickson from IHS Markit. However, Erickson described the price point as “aspirational” given that consumer expectations have been set by cheaper competitors, “although Apple has done a great job of being extremely profitable without having to cater to the mainstream, and they will drop their price over time”, he said. Besides the HomePod, Apple unveiled a collection of new and upgraded products, including a new computer, the $4,999 iMac Pro. The more powerful iMac is intended to address concerns of creative professionals who had been limited to much less powerful iMacs or the much-loved Mac Pro, which hasn’t been updated since 2013. There was also a new 10.5in version of the iPad Pro, the tablet for professional users, which can support a full-sized keyboard cover. The device has a better display, is faster, and comes with 64GB of memory. The device will start at $649 and start shipping next week. There’s also a 12.9in version that starts at $799. “We’ve been pushing the boundary of iPads, and today, we’re going to push them further than we ever have before,” Cook said. Just as Google and Facebook did at their developer conferences this year, Apple announced an augmented reality platform called ARKit to allow developers to more easily create augmented reality apps, such as Pokémon Go, which overlay digital objects on to the real world. Apple’s senior vice-president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, demonstrated the company’s AR capabilities by placing a virtual coffee cup, lamp and vase onto a real table. Given that it is already supported by millions of iPads and iPhones it will, Federighi said, “be the largest AR platform in the world”. There were also a couple of updates to Apple’s web browser, Safari, including a speed boost that makes it, according to Apple, the fastest ever desktop browser. It also introduced autoplay blocking, which stops music and video from playing automatically without your permission on websites as well as “intelligent tracking prevention”, which stops ads from following you around the web.

The formation of the coalition, which was first reported by Recode, is headed up by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has been coordinating an effort to have the group be formally recognized by the United Nations. The list of over 1,000 groups includes powerful global tech firms like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook; transportation companies like Tesla, Lyft, and Uber; and notable design corporations like Adobe, Autodesk, Skanska, and Perkins + Will; as well as dozens of smaller architecture, engineering, and infrastructure firms. A statement on the the website We Are Still In outlines how coordinated actions from industry and education can bolster complementary work by local and regional governments and allow the U.S. to fulfill its commitments to the Paris agreement: In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities and businesses representing a sizeable percentage of the U.S. economy will pursue ambitious climate goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions. We Are Still In is one of many groups that have formed to endorse the Paris accord after President Trump’s announcement, including 211 mayors of the Climate Mayors, and 13 governors who make up the United States Climate Alliance. What’s notable is that the We Are Still In statement was coordinated among over a dozen groups working on collective climate action, including Climate Mayors and the United States Climate Alliance; city-focused alliances like Bloomberg Philanthropies, C40, and National League of Cities; and environmental organizations like the Rocky Mountain Institute, Sierra Club, and the World Wildlife Fund. One reason the inclusion of businesses is so critical in the conversation is that corporations drive consumer choices and shape buying habits, especially when it comes to the adoption of new technologies like solar panels and electric vehicles. Companies can also illustrate the economic impact of the climate accord—that moving to renewable energy and reducing emissions can contribute to job creation and market growth. The Trump administration has made the argument that the opposite is true, and that adhering to the Paris agreement will cost the country $3 trillion. Corporations are now including climate disclosure in financial reports, where they must outline the risks and advantages to shareholders, so they already know the benefits, notes Lynelle Cameron, VP of Sustainability for Autodesk, in a statement. “We are ready to capitalize on this business opportunity, creating both jobs and profit for shareholders,” she says. “At Autodesk, we are all in, and are more committed than ever to enlist our customers to design, build and manufacture net positive climate solutions.” Next Up In News Apple HomePod wants to take on Amazon Echo, Google Home, Sonos We Are Still In: The plan to keep U.S. in line with the Paris accord 246 mayors adopt Paris climate accord after U.S. pulls out (updated) Cities light up green in support of Paris climate agreement Architects can lead climate change fight as U.S. pulls out of Paris Accord Sanctuary cities fight back against new immigration restrictions Trending 4 all-in-one security systems for your smart home The dawn of the Internet of Things has made keeping an eye on your home that much easier. 5 affordable modern prefab houses you can buy right now Some prefab homes out there can go for upwards of $500,000 each.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Apple CEO Tim Cook delivers the opening keynote address the 2017 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) on June 5, 2017 in San Jose, California. (AFP Photo) Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The "HomePod" speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. SIZING UP THE IPAD Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Previous in Tech Ethereum, an alternative cryptocurrency to bitcoin, hit its all-time...

Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple’s web browser, seeks to make users’ online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn’t be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser’s new “intelligent tracking prevention,” meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. SIZING UP THE IPAD Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn’t. Yet it isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch.

The new tool, called Ad Experience Report, measures how well a site’s ads comply with the Better Ads Standards, which are determined by the Coalition for Better Ads. Publishers can also refer to Google’s new best practices guide. Google’s Ad Experience Report displays screenshots and videos which specifically identify the annoying ad experiences on a site so publishers know what they need to fix. The online advertising giant plans to continue its crusade against annoying ads by having Chrome automatically block them in early 2018. Specifically, Google will stop showing ads within Chrome that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards. In addition, later this year, Google will offer “Funding Choices” to publishers. This will give them the option to allow visitors to pay a fee to remove all ads on a site. Funding Choices is a measure by Google to thwart the use of ad blockers while helping publishers earn more money. “We believe these changes will ensure all content creators, big and small, can continue to have a sustainable way to fund their work with online advertising.” ADVERTISEMENT Related Posts Google Launches New Mobile Friendly Testing Tool Google to Site Owners: Create More AMP Pages Google Releases Tool to Help Filter Out Hurtful Comments Online ADVERTISEMENT Matt Southern Lead News Writer at Search Engine Journal Matt Southern has been the lead news writer at Search Engine Journal since 2013.

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By Michael Liedtke And Barbara Ortutay, The Associated Press on June 5, 2017. FILE - In this Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2011 file photo, a person stands near the Apple logo at the company's store in Grand Central Terminal, in New York. Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into peopleâ€šÃ„Ã´s homes. Tapping Appleâ€šÃ„Ã´s Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Appleâ€šÃ„Ã´s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015, Sunday, June 4, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) SAN JOSE, Calif. – Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new “smart” home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, Apple’s HomePod speaker will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is Apple’s first new device since the company launched its smartwatch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple’s annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality “experiences.” But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centred on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple’s entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG.

The fight has been taken to every social media platform, including WhatsApp, Google, Facebook and Twitter. The massive investments in digital messaging could well revolutionise political campaigns in Kenya as both Jubilee and NASA step up customised approaches to win voters. President Uhuru Kenyatta’s team and that of his main rival Raila Odinga have made heavy investments in digital media. Meant to complement their big political rallies, the two are determined to reach out to potential voters at the convenience of their target audience through all channels, including their phones. A day after Raila was named NASA presidential candidate, someone paid Google to promote a website named “The Real Raila Odinga”, full of negative stories and claims that the Opposition candidate is corrupt, violent, crooked and a liar. It also makes unsubstantiated allegations, including claims that “Raila faked food poisoning to avoid a meeting with other NASA co-principals Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang’ula”. It was referring to an incident in March this year when he was admitted at the Karen Hospital after he fell ill. The top search result for Raila on Google is “The Real Raila Odinga” website, clearly marked as an advert. Analyst Mutahi Nguyi has also set up several platforms on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, where he has been posting articles and videos of why Kenyans should not elect Raila. “After the last election, Human Rights Watch found that Raila and ODM was helping coordinate the riots throughout Kenya,” one of the posts on Facebook states, rekindling memories of the deadly 2007/2008 post-election violence. The website claims that NASA Pentagon members have previously traded accusations against each other and are now hugging on political podiums without resolving issues. In one of the videos on the controversial website, Raila in a 2002 rally accuses his co-principal Musalia Mudavadi and retired President Daniel Moi of having been the architects of the Goldenberg scam. In a recent interview, Raila insisted that Musalia was cleared of the multi-billion-shilling scam that nearly brought Kenya to its knees. Raila's team on the other hand has hired influential bloggers with millions of followers on social media to lead its dirty campaigns. Some of the bloggers use pseudonyms to comment on stories published by mainstream news organisations. The bloggers continuously collect, monitor and analyse messages from Jubilee before responding to them almost instantly. The Raila team has also been creating and widely circulating videos rubbishing Jubilee's achievements. But Uhuru’s strategists have taken the campaigns to an all-time high, with leading international data firms already on board. Global data-mining company Cambridge Analytica, contracted by Uhuru, occupies the entire seventh floor of the eight-storey Jubilee Centre in Pangani. CA is said to be capable of trawling Facebook and buying up commercial consumer datasets to identify 'persuadable' voters. An expose by the Guardian newspaper of the UK last month claimed that CA, in conjunction with its sister company AggregateIQ in Vancouver, Canada, essentially won the Brexit vote using the same strategy. It then bombards the persuadable voters with more than a billion social media posts and adverts. Cambridge Analytica is credited with helping Candidate Donald Trump to win the American presidential election last November and with helping the Leave side to win in the Brexit referendum in the UK last June. It has been described as a “psychological warfare firm”. But apart from the global firms, both Jubilee and NASA have also invested in local tech-savvy teams drawn from the information and communications technology industry. ODM Secretary General Agnes Zani told the Star that they are “handling every component of our campaigns seriously”, declining to divulge their online strategy. The Raila team has turned a widely advertised video on Jubilee delivery achievements against the ruling party. The video's adverts, currently running on TV, showcase what Jubilee describes as its achievements over the past four-and-a-half years is dubbed “A Journey of Transformation”. But in the corrupted video, widely shared on WhatsApp groups, NASA terms the Jubilee tenure “A Journey of Gimmicks and PR Stunts”. They chide Jubilee for claiming to have transformed the country's healthcare, yet Sh5 billion was allegedly lost at the Ministry of Health’s Afya House headquarters in what has come to be known as the MafyaHouse scandal. Questions over the handling of donor money at the Ministry of Health led to suspension of Sh2.5 billion funding from the US government. “A healthier Kenya? Sh5 billion looted. USAID suspended funding. 100 days’ doctors strike,” part of the text in a 1 minute, 38-second video reads. “Food security? Brokers and middlemen making billions at the expense of farmers and hungry Kenya,” it adds. The video that ends with the voice of Musalia urging NASA supporters to vote out Jubilee also claims that the Sh338 billion Standard Gauge Railway is not economically viable. Sources privy to activities in NASA promised it will be an emotional campaign, where both videos will be played and Jubilee statements used to show Kenyans how they have been suffering. “We have enough content to push on all media platforms and a strong team to broadcast the best,” said a source at Capitol Hill. Opposition bloggers believe the government harasses them for telling the truth. They argue pushing the government to address historical injustices amounts to hate speech. Both the NASA and JP teams use a Twitter deck, which offers a more convenient experience by letting people view multiple timelines in one easy interface. The deck hosts advanced features to get the most of social network support. It manages multiple accounts, the schedule for posting and builds Tweet collections, among other features. Jubilee and NASA believe they can capitalise on social media users to reach out to millions of voters through a ripple effect. Besides, there is Uhuru's own Facebook page and Twitter handle that has about 3.068 million likes and 2.13 million followers, respectively. Here, Uhuru’s team actively post his schedule, campaign videos, and press statements. Raila on the other hand has 1.07 million followers on Twitter and 816,998 likes on Facebook.

A. Verdin (name redacted for privacy) isn't the only person who allegedly scammed review keys from video game PR representatives and developers, but he's one of the few who got caught. Verdin – AKA "BattlefieldAxe," "Airo95," "RaphaAaron," and "James Rodriguez" – has a reputation among publishers and PR reps for running game key scams; a con where the scammer falsifies some manner of credential in order to score free download keys for video games, often indie titles. In Verdin's case, he's almost certainly impersonated a member of Twitter's verification team and the PlayStation UK team, as well as allegedly impersonated representatives from EA, Square Enix, Bethesda, and Friday the 13th developer Gun Media. Although it's unclear how falsifying Twitter credentials figured into his alleged scam, Verdin reportedly obtained "about 50 keys" for the Friday the 13th: The Game beta as well as multiple Battlefield beta keys. Since then, he's allegedly posted a since-deleted apology on Twitter, where he offered to reimburse the companies he's scammed via PayPal. This was approximately seven months ago, back in October 2016 – based on this screenshot. Although most of the screenshots we've obtained have been from second-hand sources, we've been able to conclusively verify that Verdin's current Twitter account once went by the handles accused of key scamming. The only thing we've been unable to confirm is whether Verdin ever apologized. Two months after the apology, Verdin allegedly went back to his old ways by implying he was a member of the Friday the 13th: The Game development team on Twitter. Verdin initially responded to request for comment, but went silent after asking me what my plans were for the article. The allegations surrounding Verdin won't be surprising to anyone who works in game development or PR. It's the age-old tale of people willing to pull some shady business in order to get free stuff. But since this is the video game industry, the whole ordeal has to be infinitely more complex than just stealing a loaf of bread from a grocery store. Becky Taylor, a game developer/businessperson/PR rep known for working with Reboot Magazine and Innervate, was the person who clued me into Verdin's reputation ("he called me a cunt and blocked me for calling him out"), although Square Enix Senior CM Cat Karskens and Bithell Games' Mike Futter aren't big fans either. Taylor's experience is notable, in part because she could point to a man with a name and say "he did it." Most of the time, you don't even get that unless you have deep pockets and a lot of free time.  We initially confirmed that Verdin previously owned the @BattlefieldAxe, @Airo95, @RaphaAaron, and @JrodriguezVT accounts by Googling the respective Twitter URLs. Thanks to Google's cache, we found that some Tweets associated with the old handle were connected to the new one, confirming our suspicions. The Tweets either took the form of redirected posts or replies from other accounts. We also manually combed through nearly 3,000 Tweets "liked" from Verdin's current account, where he had interacted with people manually replying to his old handles. Be warned, that link is very NSFW – the guy likes porn and isn't afraid to show it. I've scrolled through so many bare asses while reporting this story, I think I'm 100% desensitized to nudity. Although Verdin allegedly did most of his work on Twitter, most scammers prefer more traditional forms of communication. "I can't tell you how many fake emails I used to get a day when I worked at a development studio. Hell, I still get them – and I get them asking for keys for free-to-play games on Steam because they will literally copy paste the same email," Taylor said. "Most of the time, it's them claiming to be a Russian YouTuber, or that they have a huge Steam group I should support." The PR representatives I spoke with for this story corroborated Taylor's statements, including Zoink Games PR and Marketing Manager Mikael Forslind, who extensively documented his experience with a Russian YouTube channel. "The most elaborate scam [we encountered] was the YouTube channel that rebrands the whole channel every now and then, " Forslind said. "So, the scammer creates a YouTube channel and calls it something like 'Mike's Gaming Channel.' They add correct artwork, register an email something like mikes_gamingchannel@gmail.com. Then [they add] a few videos, normally just recorded videos with gameplay and no editing work or voice-over work. Then they register their channel on sites that deal with key requests and my guess is that they just request all games they come across," Forslind said. "I fell for that, which makes me furious." Forslind attached a Google Sheets document that lists some of the scammers he's encountered, along with screenshots from a YouTube channel that has rebranded multiple times over the course of its short existence. In fact, it changed from "FancyFish" to "UnendingGaming" while this article was being written. Although you can see many hallmarks of the channel rebranding con – new icons, new staffers, clear form letter, etc. –  the scammer failed to obfuscate the identical channel URL. It's hard to glean much from Unending Gaming's miasma of Russian Let's Plays and low-quality gameplay footage, but there are a few early videos boasting "The Rock Gaming" branding – proving the channel once went by a completely different name. One TRG-branded video in particular is just opera singing over a Windows desktop. There's also the story of J. Carmona, AKA "TheKamikazeYT," who became infamous on Reddit for allegedly reselling game keys he had obtained from developers. "[Carmona] went rogue and simply started selling all the keys he got from developers on G2A. He was already on lots of mailing lists and perhaps is still getting free keys from developers, who are unaware that he is using them for profit," said Yulia Vakhrusheva, the Director of PR at TinyBuild. "Believe it or not, but he still reaches out to us, trying to get keys even though he was outed many times!" "I confronted him, and I said 'Sorry, you are associated with scamming tons of video game developers and selling the provided game keys on G2A. You will need to buy all the games from now on,'" Vakhrusheva said. Although Carmona's alleged new YouTube account ZurLoko shares a business contact email with TheKamikazeYT, it's somewhat less suspicious – in part because he gets a decent amount of comments and likes/dislikes. Most of the content on his new channel seems legitimate, and although I don't speak Spanish, it does sound like the same guy. The only thing on ZurLoko worth noting is a referral link to G2A – a grey market for download keys we've covered extensively on this website, and a place where Carmona could have sold game keys with little to no oversight. "This specific encounter didn't come up in our communication with G2A, but this is something that we see all the time. We brought several people to G2A's attention, but even when they are banned, they can just create a new account and continue their shady business," Vakhrusheva said. "It's a perpetual loop." G2A came up multiple times in my conversations with PR and developers, in part because the contentious relationship between G2A and the rest of the games industry only gets more volatile with each passing day. Although a GameStop equivalent for digital downloads wouldn't be the worst thing in the world (can you imagine being able to offload all those extra Humble Bundle keys with ease?), G2A has been at the center of many controversies, including a story on Kotaku where a key scammer endorsed G2A as a good place to fence stolen goods and a feature on this very outlet where yours truly accidentally purchased stolen property off the marketplace. Vakhrusheva believes that G2A's open market is partially to blame for the plague of key scammers, since it's so easy to just turn around and sell keys. "We think that every company distributing our product needs to be authorized by us. If we had that level of control, it would drastically hurt gray marketplace and key scammers," Vakhrusheva said. Raw Fury's David Martinez put it a little more succinctly. "If someone really wants to play our games for cheap then we'd understand if they 'borrow' our titles from a 'friend.' We'd rather they do that instead of giving money to G2A's 'business,'" Martinez said. When reached for comment, G2A did not tell us of any specific plans to combat fraud on the platform. "Actual instances of fraud on G2A are extremely low," said G2A head of PR Maciej Kuc in an email interview, claiming the site's percentage of fraudulent transactions was "far below" one percent. "The illegitimate or stolen key narrative is just a farce. What developers dislike is that we empower consumers – that's what has found us so many enemies." Becky Taylor disagrees. "The fight is usually 'Why shouldn't customers be able to sell their unused keys – or resell games like GameStop does?' Well, that's the big question right there. Could G2A redeem itself if they were able to block stolen keys easily?" Taylor said. "Though, there might have been a tussle [regarding stolen product at GameStop] at some point, I truly don't believe GameStop has even 1% the same amount of stolen games as G2A." Although we cannot verify the level of fraud conducted at GameStop or G2A, GameStop is somewhat protected by state-level secondhand dealer laws in the United States. When trading games in my home state of New York, I had to provide an address and some form of government ID. Florida requires a physical description and a "right thumbprint." Three years ago, Philadelphia GameStops came under fire for taking the fingerprints of trade-in customers. eBay is maybe a better 1:1 comparison than GameStop, but I can't imagine anyone looking to offload stolen goods would bother with shipping items across the country when they could sell them locally for cash. According to Kuc, G2A's current seller verification process requires users to provide a phone number, a social media account "with history," and a PayPal account. It took me about a minute to figure out how to set up a dummy PayPal account – I already knew about Google Voice and the myriad of ways you can make a social media account look real. I brought this to Kuc's attention, but he insisted the site would still be able to ferret out scammers. "While someone could put in the time to set up a seller’s account that is not tied to their personal information, they will always have to provide us with that personal information if they want to withdraw their money from G2A," Kuc said. He also told Destructoid that G2A is developing "an even more detailed verification process," but declined to share any details, as the process is still "in the end stages of development." In response to game key fraud, developers and PR firms have created whole sites to combat the issue, like Vlambeer's Do Distribute or Evolve PR's Terminals. There's also the relatively new Woovit and KeyMailer, which specialize in connecting YouTubers/streamers to game publishers. These websites restrict key access to verified individuals – this doesn't completely eliminate key scammers, but it certainly helps weed them out. "The other day I got a request on Do Distribute from a guy who wrote for 'a website' and just linked awebsite.com," said Mikael Forslind. "That's hilarious." Tom Ohle, the director of Evolve PR, spoke with us about their key management site Terminals, which is currently exclusive to Evolve clients – although the company plans to open the site to other developers "sometime in June." "We absolutely deal with key scammers all the time, and we built Terminals – in part, at least – as a solution to the issue. In fact, we get so many requests from key scammers – I'd say a good half-dozen a week, and that's just the products I work on directly – that dealing with them has become so routine, and it's actually hard to pinpoint any particularly interesting ones," Ohle said. "We have the verification process in place on Terminals to help with this, and while it does mean we have to dedicate people's time to verify our contacts, I think it's worth it in the long run." Most of the PR reps I spoke with for this story cautioned independent developers without PR representation to not just hand out codes willy-nilly. Even if you think you're speaking with someone you recognize, be sure to double-check if you see anything even remotely suspicious. Even traditional media outlets can be impersonated – we were forwarded email correspondence where a particularly savvy con artist impersonated PC Gamer's Wes Fenlon and came pretty close to getting away with a bunch of keys. Eventually, key scammers will likely come up with a new way to fool developers, but for now, better to be safe than spending your free time hunting down fraudulent keys on G2A.

Picture: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images MARTYN LANDI 21:55 Monday 05 June 2017 Share this article 0 Have your say Apple will go head-to-head with rivals Amazon and Google, as the US tech giant throws its hat into the growing smart home arena. Apple boss Tim Cook took to the stage at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California to unveil the ‘HomePod’ speaker which he claimed will ‘reinvent home audio.’ The speaker will compete directly with Amazon’s Echo and Google Home for the lucrative smart speaker market. It will utilise Apple music and Siri to do everything from play music to control other smart home appliances. The device is just under seven inches tall and uses spacial awareness to improve how it sounds based on the acoustics and available space in its surrounding environment. “We want to reinvent music in the home in the way we invented mobile music,’ said Mr Cook, “we really think its going to take your home music experience to the next level.” The speaker, which will be available at £270 will act as general assistant in people’s homes. Since the launch of Amazon’s Echo last year and Google Home in March, both of which have been popular with consumers, Apple had been widely expected to enter the market. Chief executive Mr Cook, referencing the company’s iTunes service and iPod, said: “Just like portable music, we would like to reinvent home music.” The HomePod will use its internal microphones to pick up voice commands and uses the same processor chip as the iPhone to pump out “spatially aware” sound, Apple said. The tech giant confirmed the device would go on sale in December in the US, UK and Australia. Apple earlier introduced a new version of its iPad Pro, as well as a raft of new software updates. The new iPad Pro will have a 10.5-inch screen, placing it between the current 9.7 and 13-inch screens of Apple’s flagship tablet. The tech firm also updated its Apple Pay system to enable users to directly pay other people using a text message as part of its iOS 11 upgrade. The company’s TV app is also adding Amazon and its Prime Video service later this year for the first time. The next version of iOS, which powers the iPhone and iPad, as well as desktop software macOS and the Apple Watch’s watchOS were also updated at the firm’s Worldwide Developer Conference, WWDC. Apple boss Tim Cook said the event was “the best and biggest WWDC ever”. The technology giant also announced a new software kit for developers called ARKit, which will enabled app developers to build augmented reality apps on Apple’s platforms more easily. Augmented reality is a mixture of live images and virtual animations and objects placed over them. Apple also said it was making its virtual assistant Siri more aware of context, enabling it to recommend and remind users more accurately based on how they use their device. The firm said Siri will now better understand follow-up questions and scheduling as well as handle language translation for the first time. A preview of a new high-powered iMac Pro desktop, due to be released later this year, was also teased.

By Michael Liedtke and Barbara Ortutay / Associated Press SAN JOSE, California — Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new “smart” home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The “HomePod” speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple “can’t afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. Keeping it real with VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple’s annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality “experiences.” But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple’s entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. New iPhone features New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Mac gets an upgrade Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple’s web browser, seeks to make users’ online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn’t be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser’s new “intelligent tracking prevention,” meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. Sizing up the iPad Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn’t. Yet it isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Watch the watch Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Ortutay reported from New York.   Most Read Appointed county councilman’s youth, connections criticized MARYSVILLE — Nate Nehring’s youth and political ties were objects of curiosity… Jun 7th, 2017 by Noah Haglund Vote here for the high school athletes of the year Here are the seniors nominated for Boys Athlete of the Year and… Jun 8th, 2017 by Herald Staff Ribbon-cutting ceremony set for WSU building in north Everett EVERETT — An open house is planned for Aug. 15 for the… Jun 7th, 2017 by Jim Davis Woman uses app to track man suspected of stealing from her LAKE STEVENS — A 26-year-old woman discovered her Jeep had been broken… Jun 7th, 2017 by Caitlin Tompkins DUI suspected in Lake Stevens head-on collision; 2 injured LAKE STEVENS — Deputies with the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office investigated an… Jun 7th, 2017 by Herald Staff © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers — the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad — all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said. MACS, PHONES AND PAYMENTS Who's hired? Check our People in Business Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. __ Ortutay reported from New York.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Who's hired? Check our People in Business Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches — but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Weekend poll: How many photos are synced to your Google Photos account? David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/06/04 3:44pm PDTJun 4, 2017 120 Plus 1 on G+ 202 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares366 Applications Polls The Google account dashboard is a pretty cool way to see what's going on with your Google account, and the last time we ran a poll utilizing stats from it, we asked you how many apps Google thought you'd installed to your various devices. This week, we're doing Google Photos. To see how many Photos are synced to your Google Photos account, just head to https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard and scroll down until your see the entry for Photos, as shown below. So, how many photos are synced to your account? I'm at a little over 8,000 at this time, and that honestly doesn't seem like a lot to me (my Lightroom catalog contains over twice as many). I'll be curious to see how many of your break into the five-figure ranges. How many photos are on your Google Photos account? Under 100 100-999 1,000-2,499 2,500-4,999 5,000-9,999 10,000-19,999 20,000-39,999 More than 40,000. View Results  Loading ... Tags google+ photos photos sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Boolean Corporation the trick is to plug your iPhotos Library to the desktop uploader and see the magic happen. I have my Canon and SONY photos up there as well. ZettabyteGamer 6,002 photos Jes Marwaha 3.5k, since like 2014ish rndusrnm479461 Surprised that mine rose to 23k. Used to be 15k not long ago. Liam Clifford 17,017 Iwanova > 7k photos backup from blackberry until now yippiedad 78,693 Danyel Gustavo Just copy/paste of the question I made to another user: does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Barron Roth Yes, I've got 500k in Google Photos and it can be unbearably slow. makapav 55K and no it's not slow for me on my Pixel XL or Chrome on Windows. Danyel Gustavo I currently have 5k photos from my phone uploaded. I was thinking about uploading all my 15k photos taken with my camera. Alvar Lagerlof That will be no problem Michael Zinfandel Rork Not in the slightest. Hardly any of those are on my phone, and when on the web it's purely cloud based so it only loads what you are looking at. There is absolutely no lag from having more images in Google Photos. Level380 at 55k its not slow at all, searching is still fast. yippiedad Nope, I haven't noticed any lag. Victoria I have 15500 photos backed up and it's not slow in the least, still blazing fast. icethegreat 40k woohoo vmxr lower than 10 lol Liam Spradlin 55,207 photos 👀 vmxr are you trying to map the world 👀 Calvin Mccoy I get the job done from comfort of my home, with the help of hassle-free gigs that only takes from you a Desktop computer system in addition to web connection and I am also pleased than before... After half a year with this career and therefore i obtained cash in sum Thirty six Thousand us dollars... Ordinarily I make up approximate to eighty bucks/h and work for three to four hours every single day.And excellent point about this task is the fact that you can supervise time and effort whenever you work and for just how long as you may like and you attain a paycheck weekly........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Boolean Corporation 57,382... noob. :P Boolean Corporation The creepy thing is that it has recognized photo locations without having GPS data in my camera photos. Robert Porter If you have Google maps tracking your location it can go off of that too vidvox That was the craziest thing about using my DSLR on a trip through Texas last year, looking at the photos online and seeing the correct GPS location on them! Tyler Humphreys My mom had some pictures of Siberia, California and Google Photos thought they were from Russia, just from an album named "Siberia". chacalau 62,000 ish keltypack I have over 66,800 photos on Google Rob 54,857..... Both of you beat me! :P Đức Thành I feel small on here with just under 48.600 photos. But to be fair, my Nexus 5's relatively mediocre camera does diminish the frequency of my photo-taking whims a bit. I feel like this would be a different story if I had something like the Pixel or Nexus 6P, or even the Nexus 5X instead. LightofHonor Beat me. 50,866 smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245 Jerry Suppan Wow!　And I thought I had too many at 51,000+. Well, I guess we can store our entire life from birth if if we include pre-digital era scanned photos. (^J^) Đức Thành That is a creepy thought but somehow I find it kind of exciting as well. Imagine storing all of our memories, thoughts and emotions on the cloud. Victor A backup of met-art archives? 😁 Danyel Gustavo Does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Liam Spradlin Doesn't seem to make the app lag. Of course if I scroll back a really long way it'll take a sec for the photos to all load in, but otherwise things seem fine. Teja How to check the exact count? Luqmaan Mathee "To see how many Photos are synced to your Google Photos account, just head to https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard and scroll down until your see the entry for Photos, as shown below." It's in the article. Teja Oops, missed that. Its 51,929 photos. :D Carl Draper Photos does not appear for me on that page Margaritas Ante Porcos omg! are breaking films into frames and then upload? lol Kenni Odelheim I said 20-40 as a guess, but it was 46k I found out afterwards... jesus man.. I snap alot :D sssgadget ~15000 Booyabobby 3075 Paul_Werner 26,263 photos currently dcdttu 47,793. I used the photos uploader on my desktop. Lexxior what happens if you do? dcdttu It uploads pictures. Jorim Tielemans 78,533 photo's, that's only 3 times the amount of my bookmarks 🤐 maybe that would be a cool poll for next weekend. Lexxior wtf 20000+ bookmarks?! Wis Zero. makapav My condolences. matteventu 1543. I'm not a big shooter. But I don't understand how they count "Albums"... I'm sure I don't have 464 albums lol (just 4-5 actually). Antoine Martin Every link you share creates a hidden album nagi 71,234... yes, I shoot a lot. Nathaniel V Stupid question. Why is the album count so high? I think I've only got about 40 albums. Ruddock's looks the same... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b938bcf21775e44a09d96b5f066996b5222174f26d73027381a6cbf127a6ce8.png Sean It probably includes the auto-generated "this day x years ago" albums and such Lars Jeppesen Also I think it includes "shared" stuff makapav All those Hangouts albums from Picasaweb in the background that are probably hidden in Google Photos. Morten Ulv Yep, this is the correct answer. You could see them in Picasaweb. One for each day. Tomáš Petrík I have almost that many albums with less than half the photos. Bryan Mine says 577 albums, but if i click the arrow to expand it, it only shows 3 (which is correct) Hexlattice Yeah, it makes a shared album every time you share even just one photo with a person... Kinda why I prefer sharing a photo via Hangouts or some other means. I don't like the clutter it makes in my albums. senor_heisenberg Under a thousand. whispy_snippet 11,049 Dominic Labbé Well.... 99042... 😮 Got my first digital camera in December 1999. BigTurk Beat me by almost 2000! I got my first digital camera in 2002. Kudos to you haha Richard Riker 13,148 Shaunak Guharay 18,679 . I expected it to be somewhere around 5000, but holy shit JW 12k Joshua Ferguson 61K, I've slowed down over the last couple of years Simps 11,222 photo's and 959 albums that I have not created. Boolean Corporation Also, people like to share their sites with me... it appears... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fbf6c5a8bcd2762fb0751916cddfc1c30c07e67b2f9bc325f16d5e39a091d222.png Stoffers I've also had 1,648,103 shared with my 2 sites. Boolean Corporation So it must be the total amount of public Google Sites out there. Dn Bro I have 8,973,294...I'm not really sure where they are. exadeci https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3db3521ceda62f5bd4e638a39d5ae74f7f04e770dc7485d7a198f8b445df4f99.png Anand Slightly higher than your count ;). What are these sites??? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/be13189cca9396d4e74c49fdc6aecbbbd4492ec5084d30989724d23a522efbbe.png Captain_Invisible 8.973.487 here 😲 Andrew Bone Just beat you 😉 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/707765784503bfaf20d2fe1327e82cdb628e443e39d108a823b2ddff6dd7e04f.png Roderick Gadellaa 8,973,436 :P Vasilj Milošević Nearly 4M over here. WTF? Where are those sites? Anthony https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a438430be5924c8714c16e394b9f093c1241bebf635d0d22be1752a0267c8d77.png Cheesespix Not a single :) I don't save my photos online. Corey Kinard Here, have a 🍪 Phil Miller Do you hide them under your mattress? BigTurk 97,222 :O Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher I don't have Photos listed! But I estimate around 250,000-300,000 photos. Makes Photos on my phone practically unsuable, somehow Google Photos insists keeping all thumbnails in internal memory which takes up 2-3GB of space. Photos uses up all the battery of my phone if I enable the app :-( dsDoan All of my photos are synced with Google Photos, but I don't take many photos, so it's under 1,000. Jason Brian Chapa 35,445 Maxr1998 Only slightly above 2500 pictures, that's​ everything I took in the last five years. I don't take many pictures, but that's also because I'm very selective with my images - I remove most "duplicates"/alternative photos which aren't that good and only keep the best images. Bryan How does the album count work? I've only made 3 albums but it says i have 577 albums. App Shah 65K + https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4077abf057824ff03b40189ea40058cc9fdea8e6160c0bcbde23fbeaaac30a52.png Martins Nkem I've got over 2200 photos mostly photos from my picasa album and photos i uploaded to Google drive about 3 years ago. I prefer not to use cloud storage for photos any more. Richard Markert Under 100, lol. Try under 10. I don't use Photos. VAVAMk_2 Over 1700...I need to take more photos I guess. Laurentiu 27,809 SchmilK EnHaggen Just under 200,000 photos over here. Took 6 days to upload my entire photo library via desktop app. Everything I've shot with my DSLR and phones over the past 13 years. Phil Miller 42 photos a day? Do you even have time to sleep? SchmilK EnHaggen I shoot a lot of bursts, plus it's a mix of me, my wife, and my 2 kids phones all synching to the same account (granted the oldest is only 7, but she has been know to take 42 pictures of a TV show lol) Vasilj Milošević 52.832 photos 3.784 albums :D Image upload bugs for me on disqus, so here's imgur link: http://imgur.com/a/qY6gw Jeffrey Heesch Only 7,770 for the time being, but I just recently got myself a DSLR, so I'm expecting my Google storage to hurt in the near future. Mr Wright 64,616 all nudes 😎 Dmitry Stepanushkin about 30000. Nudes will stay on local storage 😁 cadtek91 I don't think the Album counts are accurate. Lord Argyris 2,925 here. Everything since I got my Nexus 7 on December 31st, 2013, which is when I officially joined the Android ecosystem. I'm curious, where is the Sites statistic some people have posted? I can't seem to find that anywhere on my account dashboard. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f18afe5301756a2f37e6f449c2faf0ec975cf47ead995985d6cf0ee4cb56fe1c.png tapsboy 10,351 JG 64,884... With another 1,940-some waiting to upload as I type (literally just got back from an extended data-light/less vacation where I was the unofficial group photographer). A lot of the pics (especially from this trip) are burst shots. Trying to photograph something as we drove by so I just let it go to get the most tree-less pic... Or to make an animation or panorama pic. That, and of course, cat pics :) Hey, if Google is going to give me free unlimited storage... Might as well take advantage. Bryan Kolb Just under 200,000... Dre 44,153 Kevin Sword "Wekeend" poll? Guess so! 9,179 photos. Phil Miller 19,268. For my 20k photo, it will be a pick of my friend Harry Johnson. Akilesh Akil https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b22006051777d76bece05eecfcae428cdcf2381379fdc6e701e6c4f64988671.jpg Barron Roth I feel like I'm an edge case, Google Photos runs very slow for me 😔 an old screenshot, I probably broke 500k these days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d2363f77f2556cf6b91ee1f158be42694f8fcb74f9869a02f388dddcdc95e383.png Rob What are all those photos? Is your porn collection included in that number? Kidding ;) Your comment about the service being slow is odd, it should only load what you're looking at and not everything. But perhaps something goes wrong when the number is so high. Barron Roth I'm a photographer, so it shouldn't be too unusual! It's slow mostly during search or scrolling through historical dates. uthark 107,383 Dlang123 Photos ‌124,910 tu3218 If I upload photos to google photos that wasn't taken on my phone, will they be analyzed and sorted correctly by their date, location ,etc. Assuming all this data is attached to the file. Robert Porter Yes, any photo on Gphotos is analyzed. If they don't have the locations, I believe Google fills that info with your Google maps location during that time. HSidhu 000064 Photos :) Victor %01000000 David Zero smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245. I have it sync with my PC, and all my DSLR pics get uploaded Justin Osborne 15k, but probably half of those just since I got the Pixel, due to our first baby. Over 20GBs of HQ pics/video since then. Michael Zinfandel Rork 70,503 Level380 55K and counting. Leandro Brandão 10132. I backed up some old photos and used the photo scan app to scan others, maybe 100 or 200 photos. I use google photos since my first android phone in 2012, i was amazed how that worked back then, now is even better. Joshua Talley Pretty sure I saw over 100k several months ago... codingismy11to7 17k, in original quality... and I've recently been thinking about uploading my 90+ GBs of stuff from before gphotos existed... Willie Chalmers III I am definitely in the minority with only 2,140 photos. What do you people take pictures of? b_boogey_xl I've got like 25k photos but if I remember correctly, this isn't just Google Photos but any photo you have uploaded to Google across their many services, including Hangouts, Google+ Messager, Google Voice, Google+, Picasa, etc… I believe if you go to your About Me page you can see all the "albums" and photos you've ever uploaded to those Google services (not including Google Photos). Mike in KC 457. Guess I'm not much of a photographer... Saqib What is maximum free storage allowed with Google photos? tehboogieman They say unlimited for compressed images Miku is Best Vocaloid 10000 and counting Joshua Worth 83,689 😊 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ef968361c0424a651500b83acdd44d4fa19466201c00685b3a584e99d0e40e77.jpg Sherrie B 297,771 Daniel Rodriguez Looks like I've taken a picture or two in my time... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/505b72e38a4d6a15ced01c270253dc58d8777887f0c273491675ea1e322be65e.png Morten Ulv Jesus. What are all those photos of? You take hundreds of photos every day? I take maybe 10 000 per year of my kids, so that's a modest average of ~30 per day. Andrew Bone ~95% selfies 😉 Daniel Rodriguez Oh god, not if I can help it. No one needs to see that much of me. abc He takes a pic of every meal he's ever eaten. Daniel Rodriguez .. guilty as charged. Daniel Rodriguez Hah, actually, I'm definitely an edge case with an unusual situation: I have a little 'lifecam' thing that takes pictures every 30 seconds that I use when traveling around, so it generates thousands and thousands of pictures when using it. The company that makes it recently went under, and so the service they offered where they hosted the pics it took went down- I downloaded my pics before it went down, and uploaded them to Google Photos, all in the Unlimited storage when letting Google compress them (which is fine, the vast majority aren't high quality anyway). So far, no issues with it, Google claims unlimited storage when you use their compression, and, numbers above showing, they mean it. create812 Google is in an intense meeting now, discussing how to handle "whales" like you. Daniel Rodriguez Hey, they promise unlimited storage if using their 'high quality' compression, I'm just taking them up on the offer! Francisco Peña they gonna throttle you from taking any more pictures. Daniel Rodriguez I'm actually curious if they will, I upload tens of thousands at a time when I travel thanks to my lifecam, and so far haven't run into any issues or gotten any alerts. I tell the client to upload them using the Google 'high quality' compression, for which they offer unlimited storage if you use it, and so far, they've been as good as their word. Definitely not doing anything that's against terms of service, all falls within the service's promised offer, so if they did throttle me, I'd love to know why. There's a big difference between 'unlimited' and 'unlimited as long as you don't go over 50,000 photos' or something like that. Artem Russakovskii Around 35k for me. Dennis 64.498 - ich speichere mittlerweile ausschließlich dort.. ast00 3342. I guess I don't take many pictures. Roderick Gadellaa Somehow Photos doesn't show up for me in that list. It's supposed to be above Play Music, right? It shows Payments there for me. Weird? vwnut13 I'd have more, but they are in a "brand account" attached to my Gmail. Still accessable online, but no longer in the Android app. Thanks for breaking, then removing that feature Google. Trent 25,525 it was very low prior to getting my Nexus 5X when that and Local Guides launched. The Pixel has raised it somewhat, but getting my DSLR and traveling fairly often (only 8 countries so far this year, but about that many again planned up until December) to take pictures and backing up my RAW files along with JPEGs has made a big difference. Peter World Citizen I love cats. I've just over 5k of photos of pussies. Plus another 2k of food and cars/bikes. Jan-Lk Else Where's the no option? Javier180 Simply dont vote. McClain S https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4911bca160a898e3d9f1f092a2af15587d485f0ca9ef12ceb21637dcd00bd2a6.png Arvid Over a 100.000 photos. I did upload everything I have, including older ones I scanned and our Family archive (going back to 1960) Wilson I'm running out of storage :O Victor 4982 albums and 246688 photos. Everything since 1996 on my Amiga till now, where every picture received or taken with the phone gets automatically baked up. Erik 41000 for now. I hope AI will improve so I can find what I'm looking for. It would be nice not to get pictures of cats when I search for dogs, buses and cameras when I search for cars and picture frames when I search for computers for example. Oh, and face recognition is still not available in Europe. I guess Google doesn't want to upset EU more than they already have. Rob I have face recognition in Europe. Not sure how I did, but it's fairly easy to activate it. I think by a single-time usage of VPN and reset app data. Have had it ever since. Alenekbell Google is paying 97$ per hour!

James 53,235 so far. I have had a hard drive failure and if it wasn't for them being backed up, theses photo s would have been lost. sasu85 Backup in Google compressed resolution or at full resolution? Do you have also other backup (like hard drive?) Or not? James It just so happens that my pics are 12mp or less and I believe that is the restriction that Google has set. Many of my pictures are scanned pictures from old photos and every smart phone I owned (I always had them backed up). I do have them on my hard drive, but have actually been rethinking this as I see no benefit from having on my hard drive. Just 440. Removed all after switching from Nexus 5 to Pixel, and will do so after switching from my Pixel to something else. mcored Photos ‌66,423 Tom Daley settings say 7700 same folder on my server says 20000+ Hmmmm not sure whats happening there Timothy Vreeland 38k, so close to moving up in the poll bracket.

I really do not take many photos, most of what I do take is used for online sales or confirmation photos, so they get deleted after the transaction. Another large number is having info from hardware at work so I can enter it into a database when I get back to my desk. Again those get deleted once that data is entered. Alfonso Surroca 8K, and that's including the fact that I synced like 15 years of photographs from my desktop computer to my Photos account. abc This is more of a "how many photos do you take" question than a Google Photo question. benmarvin 16,405. And I don't even take that many pictures. Some of my photos go all the way back to Picasa days Indefinite Implosion Yep 15,608 and a lot are from before I had a smartphone/from my DSLR when I had a smartphone. Brandon I've got just over 5k, which is less than many people here but is pretty much every photo I've taken in the last 12-ish years. I try to remember to back up to my external hard drive now and again just in case, but otherwise Google is the only thing I use for photo storage, management, or editing. James Miller My wife takes pictures of our 5 boys daily with our DSLR. Whenever I put them on our NAS drive, I have them automatically backed up using the desktop backup client. I'm up to 116,053, but that number grows by about 1000 every couple of weeks. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a6190002ab404d0e7e513fe45d2931f9173bc76ab04c9c6bfc6167f5e961b10a.jpg Deb Newman I quit using google photo because my account got hacked and googles recovery system wouldn't verify it was me even though I knew most of the answers to their questions, finally got to speak to someone from tech support and still would not verify.

Mangesh Narawade If Google include true 'hide photos' feature with security like pincode/fingerprint, these numbers will go sky high gsDroid You should have had an option for zero. Charles Sweeney 13k'ish Rob 54,857 3223 And here we are, uploading our mug and stuff to skynet. That'll make their job far easier *runs into a bunker with tinfoil hat on* In all seriousness, this has helped alleviate loads of storage issues, especially for phones with smaller storage :) Jesse Lee I didn't see the article on installed apps, so wasn't as surprised to see 11K photos saved but instead, that I've installed 1,355 apps.

Kostas 💪🎩 Any way to put photos to a special place separate from the others, that aren't in your face all the time? Abhimanyu Seth Just 44,672 photos till now! philopek each as he likes but then i think the question is not very specific hence the answer doesn't provide much else than a sheer number. if the question had been "self made and unique images" that would have provided a more useful picture. while there certainly are photographers, selfie addicts and the likes, i know how many years it takes to produce a few 10'000 images of notworthy quality and uniqueness because i'm producing photos for the last 45 years now, all digitalized and stored safely, and at the times the pace of production was insanely high and still one gets' nowhere near some of the numbers that have bee mentioned here. further what are all the folks doing once google will drop a platform entirely. i remember that i have changed platform due to changes made by apple and/or google which is why all my images are now structred in simple folders and subfolders, storable and managable on every computer cross platform, no matter what some may decide. when apple changed from iphoto to photos for example most features were missing and to continue watching the library on apple-tv one had to purchase software without knowing whether it would meet requirements etc. i would like to know how many of those images are self-made and more or less unique, everything else is just claiming bragging rights IMO Ozl yeah, i will triple my photos and videos by the end of the year when i get the New Pixel Phone xD (hoping it still has that unlimited upload) Chris Foote 139,750.

On another dramatic day for investors in America's technology giants, Alphabet rose as high as $1,007.40 on the stock market in New York. Google shares have jumped more than 1,900 per cent since they started trading at around $50 each in 2004, with the company now worth £535billion. The stock has risen nearly 40 per cent in the last 12 months. Although Amazon shares reached $1,000 first, there are fewer in circulation, meaning it is worth £378billion, some £157billion less than Alphabet. Google Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange for the first time in August 19, 2004 The rise in the Google share price came as tech firms were forced to defend their handling of extremist content following the latest terror attack in London. Theresa May called for areas of the internet to be closed because they provide a 'safe space' for terrorist ideology – piling pressure on YouTube owner Google, WhatsApp owner Facebook and Twitter to tackle extremist content.

Share this article Share But there is little sign of investor confidence in the tech giants waning with the so-called Faang stocks – Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google – among the favourites. Technology stocks like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook have soared this year, leaving other sectors in their wake. But the boom has fuelled fears in some quarters that a bust could be on the way. American tech firms dominate the list of the most valuable stock market-listed companies in the world, with Apple at number one followed by Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon.  GOOGLE FIGURES  £535bn: Google's value – bigger than Switzerland's economy £37bn: Wealth of founders Larry Page, 44, and Sergey Brin, 43 40,000: Google searches made every second 146 per cent: What Google's shares have grown by on average every year Apple is currently worth around £630billion. Apple revealed a number of new tech initiatives at its annual developers conference yesterday. The tech giant confirmed it had partnered with Amazon to bring Amazon Prime Video app to Apple TV, teased one of its most expensive iMacs worth £3,900 - due to be released in December - and revealed it was updating its popular Apply Pay cash transfer service so that users can send cash to friends with their fingerprints. It also revealed it would be upgrading the Apple Watch so it can sync to treadmills and share workout data. The extraordinary success of the US tech industry has made their founders billions. Microsoft founder Bill Gates, 61, is said by Bloomberg to be worth £69billion while Amazon's Jeff Bezos, 53, has amassed a £66billion fortune and Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, 33, is worth £50billion. Google entrepreneurs Larry Page, 44, and Sergey Brin, 43, are worth around £37billion each. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the technology sector was their top pick at the moment. A separate report by Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at Pacific Crest, said investors should sell Apple shares and buy Google with the proceeds. He said Alphabet shares offered 'an excellent risk-reward profile and more substantial upside potential' than Apple. Google's advertising revenues jumped 19 per centin the first quarter of the year to £16.6billion as companies ramped up marketing online. Alphabet has also invested heavily in areas such as cloud-computing, artificial intelligence, voice-computing and even driverless cars as it looks for new sources of revenue. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car unit, could be worth more than £50billion by 2030. The value of Google owner Alphabet is already higher than the gross domestic product of Switzerland, the 19th largest economy in the world. Apple is worth more than the GDP of the Netherlands, the world's 18th biggest economy. Microsoft founder Gates is worth around the same amount as the entire national output of Slovakia and more than Sri Lanka, Kenya or Luxembourg.   Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched Money videos Should you worry about the election and your investments?

Credit: Bloomberg News Most Popular After blocking Google users from reading free articles in February, The Wall Street Journal's subscription business soared, with a fourfold increase in the rate of visitors converting into paying customers. But there was a trade-off: Traffic from Google plummeted 44%. That's because Google search results are based on an algorithm that scans the internet for free content. After the Journal's free articles went behind a paywall, Google's bot only saw the first few paragraphs and started ranking them lower, limiting the Journal's viewership. Executives at the Journal, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., argue that Google's policy is unfairly punishing them for trying to attract more digital subscribers. They want Google to treat their articles equally in search rankings, despite being behind a paywall. "Any site like ours automatically doesn't get the visibility in search that a free site would," Suzi Watford, the Journal's chief marketing officer, said in an interview. "You are definitely being discriminated against as a paid news site." The Journal's experience could have implications across the news industry, where publishers are relying more on convincing readers to pay for their articles because tech giants like Google and Facebook are vacuuming up the lion's share of online advertising. Striking a balance With Google, publishers try to strike a balance. While they may want to sign up more subscribers by not giving away free articles, they also don't want their content to drop in search results, which drives traffic to their sites and can boost advertising sales. For that reason, many outlets with subscription businesses -- like The New York Times and Financial Times -- let Google users read at least one free article so they still rank high in search results. Google says its "first click free" policy is good for both consumers and publishers. People want to get the news quickly and don't want to immediately encounter a paywall. Plus, if publishers let Google users sample articles for free, there's a better chance they'll end up subscribing, Google says. The tech giant likens its policy to stores allowing people to flip through newspapers and magazines before choosing which one to buy. "For the many publishers who already take advantage of this approach, it provides the ability to protect their business model and the opportunity to convert people who sample their content into paying customers," Google said in a statement. The Journal decided to stop letting people read articles free from Google after discovering nearly 1 million people each month were abusing its three-article limit. They would copy and paste Journal headlines into Google and read the articles for free, then clear their cookies to reset the meter and read more, Watford said. Free on Facebook The Journal now only lets Google users see a short snippet at the top of its articles, restricting the rest to its 2.2 million subscribers or people who arrive via social media. In the most recent quarter, the Journal's digital subscribers grew about 30% compared with the prior year, driven partly by barring Google users from reading for free. Google, meanwhile, displays a "subscription" label next to Journal articles in Google News search results, alerting users that they won't be getting a full article. The Journal's ad revenue wasn't affected by its recent drop in Google traffic because social media visits grew 34% in that time, keeping overall web traffic flat, Watford said. The Journal lets readers get some articles for free via social media like Twitter and Facebook, which the paper views as a marketing tool. Publishers have long complained about how their articles appear in search results. For years, many newspapers complained that online media companies published posts based on their reporting with a Google-friendly headline and appeared higher in search results. News Corp. has a tense history with Google. In 2009, Murdoch accused Google of stealing articles and threatened to pull his company's stories from its search results. News Corp. also competes with the tech giant in various ways. It's an investor in AppNexus, an advertising technology company that rivals Google's DoubleClick platform. News Corp. also owns Unruly, which competes with Google's YouTube in social video advertising. But the Journal isn't the only publisher skeptical of Google's policy. Jessica Lessin, founder of The Information, a technology publication, said sampling options like Google's "first click free" program "have not proven to be as beneficial as many publishers thought." Her publication, which charges $399 a year for an online subscription, doesn't let Google users read any articles for free because it's focused on a Silicon Valley audience that's more likely to find its journalism through social media than from a Google search, she said. Google and publishers often have different objectives, said Lessin, a former Wall Street Journal reporter. Google wants to capture attention so it can sell advertising. Many publishers want to convince readers to pay. "Tech companies are always going to do what's in the interest of their business," Lessin said. That's not always the same as what's in the interest of publishers, she said. -- Bloomberg News In this article: Digital Media Online Publishing Search Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2017 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Careers On Campus Site by AREA 17
Apple Thinks You’ll Pay Double for Its Smart Home Speaker Apple is positioning HomePod as a premium music device, with a price tag to match. The rumors were true. Apple just announced its own smart home speaker. If the new tech battleground is machine learning and AI, there's just no way the company was going to let Siri concede the home speaker category to Google Assistant and Alexa, which power Google Home and the Amazon Echo, respectively. First, the brass tacks. It's called HomePod, which sounds a little more like the birthing chamber of alien space babies than a great new living room audio companion. It'll cost $349 when it goes on sale in December. That's almost twice what an Amazon Echo costs ($179) and even more expensive than the Google Home ($129). And you can get it in any color you want as long as it's either black or white. Apple is aiming the device at music lovers, and promises far better sound quality than those other smart speakers. There are seven tweeters that pump out directional audio and a big custom woofer that Apple says will remain distortion-free as you ramp up the volume. The HomePod uses a six microphone array to not only hear you better, but sense the acoustics of its room placement and intelligently shape audio to provide a bigger sound stage. You can even use two at once and they'll work together. Because why not spend $700 on a pair of smart speakers? Siri has gained a bunch of new music-oriented features based around natural language recognition rather than specific keywords. You can say "add this to my workout playlist" or "who's playing drums on this track?" Machine learning takes your own preferences into account to play songs that Siri thinks you'll like. The emphasis appears to be on music (how else to justify a steep price premium for better speakers?), but of course HomePod is a full-featured hub for Siri as a home assistant. You can ask it for news or weather, create reminders, set alarms and timers, get sports scores, and generally all the general knowledge answers you expect from Siri on your iPhone or iPad. We still have some unanswered questions, of course. The biggest of which is whether HomePod will support multiple users. Siri on your phone is personal, but a box you yell at from across the living room is going to be used by everyone in your house. Google just enabled its Home speaker to work with up to 6 accounts by automatically detecting voices. Apple made no mention of HomePod supporting multiple users... which means your music preferences might get totally skewed by your kids, or your spouse might set reminders that show up on your phone instead of hers.

Apple introduces HomePod: A premium speaker with Siri The device will compete with Google Home and Amazon Echo, but Apple is trying to distinguish it with sound quality and privacy features. Greg Sterling on June 5, 2017 at 4:26 pm More As anticipated, Apple introduced its Amazon Echo and Google Home competitor today at WWDC, its developer conference in San Jose. The retro-named HomePod has Siri built in, but Apple didn’t lead with that or immediately present the new device as a stand-alone virtual assistant. The company made its pitch by emphasizing the sound quality of the speaker and the overall music experience (Apple Music is integrated). Apple initially presented HomePod as a Sonos competitor rather than a rival for Google Home and Echo. The virtual assistant features were mentioned almost as an afterthought. The HomePod with Siri can do most or all of the things that Google Home and Amazon Echo do, although there was no discussion of a developer ecosystem (that’s coming, undoubtedly). We won’t know how well it performs versus the other devices until it’s released in December. At $349, it’s the most expensive of the three; Echo retails for $179 and Google Home for $129. Amazon’s new Echo Show, with a screen, is $229. Once again, Apple is not trying to compete on price but is presenting its device as the premium choice. A subtle but important — for some consumers — feature is the fact that Apple is doing more around privacy than its rivals. Unlike both Google Home and the Amazon Echo, HomePod won’t listen all the time or record what is being said in the room: With HomePod, only after “Hey Siri” is recognized locally on the device will any information be sent to Apple servers, encrypted and sent using an anonymous Siri identifier. In addition to HomePod with Siri, there were a number of Siri improvements and upgrades announced today: It will feature a more natural-sounding voice interface. There will be a new male voice for the US market. It will be able to have more conversational interaction, with follow-up answers. There’s a new, more visual UI. Siri will now provide more results for queries. It will translate from English into five other languages. It will make context-sensitive and proactive/predictive suggestions. Apple said that Siri is currently used at least monthly on 375 million devices, in 36 countries and in 21 languages. However, Apple has a long way to go to catch up to Amazon, and even Google, in the smart speaker market. It’s estimated that Amazon has an installed base of nearly 12 million Alexa devices. Google’s numbers are less certain but probably in the low millions. About The Author Greg Sterling Greg Sterling is a Contributing Editor at Search Engine Land.

Apple's HomePod speaker pumps up the volume on tech rivals Associated Press | 0 comments SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers — the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad — all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said. MACS, PHONES AND PAYMENTS Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. __ Ortutay reported from New York. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

CEO Tim Cook announced the device as the day’s “one last thing.” “We think we can do a lot,” Cook said, “to make the experience [of listening to music in your home] much better.” The speaker is 7 inches tall, covered in “acoustic” mesh, with a 4-inch woofer. Along the bottom: 6 microphones and a beam-forming tweeter. It runs $349, which is far more expensive than competing products. View photos The Apple Homepod. Photo: AppleMore Like Amazon’s (AMZN) $179 Echo, Apple’s HomePod is not just for music. It can tell you the weather, read you news and sports scores, and perform many other tasks, all beginning with the command, “Hey Siri.” Three years after Amazon launched the Echo and six months after Google (GOOG, GOOGL) launched its $109 Home, this is Apple’s first entry to the category. And like those products, the speaker is a gateway to other Apple products, and a showcase for Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. Amazon Echo is powered by Alexa, while Google Home is powered by Google Assistant. (Last month, Microsoft announced the Invoke, a smart speaker powered by its Cortana voice assistant, set to go on sale in the fall.) Of course, you could also count the Sonos, the Beats Pill, and the Jawbone Jambox as home speakers that will have to compete with Apple HomePod now. View photos Google Home (L) vs. Amazon EchoMore You might wonder why it took Apple this long to launch a home speaker. Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller answered that very question. He reasoned that there are great speakers already out there, but they aren’t “smart,” and there are smart speakers, but they don’t always deliver great quality. In addition to its own new speaker, Apple revealed that its new iOS 11 can control all the speakers in your home from your iPhone, including any Airplay-compatible third-party speakers. Announcing the Siri speaker was just one of many Siri-related upgrades that came out of this year’s WWDC. Apple opened the event by showing off new “Siri faces” for the Apple Watch Series 2 that use the voice assistant to provide quick information on the go. Later in the event, Apple ran through upgrades to Siri, including an updated voice (female and male), ability to translate from other languages, and syncing Siri’s learning about you across all your devices. So, which smart home speaker should you buy—Amazon’s, Google’s, or Apple’s?

A second person said Airtel is getting into new partnerships around WiFi to overcome monetisation as well as ecosystem related challenges. Airtel recently inked a partnership with social networking giant Facebook for deployment of 20,000 WiFi hotspots. The telco is currently in the planning stage for this deployment. “Companies like Google and Facebook can help telcos overcome challenges related to software, as their existing software is not scalable. By partnering with telcos, companies like Google and Facebook are taking away some cost by providing software,” the second person said. The Google Station platform has WiFi network management capability, and focuses on monetisation to make the service self-sustainable. Bharti Airtel didn’t respond to ET queries, while a Google India spokesperson said the company is talking to all venue owners and service providers for Gstation as a full stack Wifi solution provider. Google India’s country head (connectivity) Gulzar Azad had previously told ET, “We are looking at more partnerships around Google Station platform. A specific initiative is partnerships with system integrators. Larsen & Toubro is one we are in discussions with. Interactions are also on with ISPs. Some will translate into partnerships.” With the Station platform, Google is extending its WiFi service beyond railway stations to places frequented by large numbers such as malls and transit stations, and in social hangout locations such as cafes and universities. It recently won its first city WiFi deal in collaboration with companies such as IBM, Larsen & Toubro and RailTel from Pune Smart City Development Corporation. “From Airtel’s perspective, the strategy will be more to help improve customer experience without spending extra on traditional mobile networks, and not necessarily a strategy around direct monetization,” Rohan Dhamija, partner and head for India and South Asia at Analysys Mason, said. He said these partnerships are an extension of Airtel’s WiFi offload strategy as these Wifi hotspots will help the telco offload traffic in peak congestion area.

We like this definition. New updates to the itslearning learning management system will make it even easier for K-12 teachers to assess and grade their students during the 2017-18 school year. Boston, MA (PRWEB) June 05, 2017 New updates to the itslearning learning management system (LMS) will make it even easier for K-12 teachers to assess and grade their students during the 2017-18 school year. Among the LMS’ enhancements is a streamlined grading workflow, a new capacity for annotating student submissions online and the ability to easily see students’ assignment status, to search and share assessment activities, and to deliver tests and see grades on any device. “Our goal is to provide the best integrated grading and assessment experience for teachers and students, alike,” said Arne Bergby, CEO of itslearning. “For students, we know the importance of staying connected to their results and outcomes of school work. So now we’ve made it a one-stop shop where they’ll be able to check their grades from any device they choose. For teachers, we were determined to make it easier to complete their assessment and grading tasks so they can spend more time teaching.” The updated grade book features enhanced data entry and it provides greater ease of use on mobile devices such as tablets. When an assignment or task deadline passes without a submittal from a student, that individual entry in the grade book will automatically become shaded red so teachers can see what’s overdue at a glance. itslearning will also allow teachers to use their browser to annotate student submissions in common file types such as MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint as well as Google Sheets, Google Docs and Google Slides. This new annotation capability will simplify the feedback process, allowing for detailed and personalized feedback. The LMS’ new assignment tool will be the fastest and easiest way to submit, view and grade student work. It will allow students to submit assignments via a cloud service such as Google Drive or OneDrive, which means that they will be able to submit an assignment, or even take a test, on any device of their choosing. The tool also will enable teachers to quickly and easily see which students have or have not completed assigned work. In addition, teachers will be able to search and share assignments, tests and third party assessments via the itslearning library. Educators can even search for assessments by standards. A new, shareable and easy-to-use test tool will allow students to take assessments on all devices and screen sizes. “Teachers can let students take a test on their phone in class and immediately see the results so they’ll know whether they need to spend some additional instruction time against the subject matter and when they can safely move on,” said Bergby. The added assessment and grading features are just the latest enhancements itslearning has announced. In April, the company introduced market-leading integrations to the world’s most popular cloud apps giving users the ability to work in Excel, Word and PowerPoint directly from within itslearning, without the need for a Microsoft email account or for any user information to be shared with Microsoft. In May, the LMS enhanced its mobile app, giving K-12 students and their teachers the full LMS experience even when they’re on the go. District administrators, teachers and students are now able to access course content, resources and tools on their Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. Additionally, students can use the app to submit assignments and attach files.

In fact, the itslearning platform is the first LMS in the K-12 marketplace to offer educators content accessible from the cloud, including 1.7 million free and open resources, searchable, tagged with rich metadata, and ready to use, and more than 35 peer-reviewed courses. Established in 1999, itslearning is headquartered in Boston, MA and Bergen, Norway and serves seven million users worldwide.

But at least some of the interest in Apple's latest version of its Safari browser was based on what it doesn't do. In a nutshell, a new version of Apple's Safari for Mac's new High Sierra operating system won't display auto-playing videos on websites, something many web users hate. And it won't allow websites to track users as they move across the web either. These new features may put Apple on users' good side, since both auto-playing videos and user-tracking are seen as annoying and intrusive. But publishers and media companies aren't likely to greet these new additions with open arms, and neither are advertisers. Apple says new version of Safari will block autoplay videos. not ideal for video publishers.- Jack Marshall (@JackMarshall) June 5, 2017 Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi said the upcoming version of Safari will block auto-play videos and will feature what he called "intelligent tracking prevention," which will keep websites from tracking your browsing data. "Now your browser history is your own," he said. Apple's moves come on the heels of an announcement from Google that the next version of its Chrome web browser—which has about 60% of the market—will block certain ad types by default, including auto-playing video ads. In some cases, websites that have a lot of low-quality ads would have all their ads blocked, not just the ones that breach Google's rules. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Related UberUber’s Biggest Rival in India Says the Company Is ‘Despicable’ Uber Uber’s Biggest Rival in India Says the Company Is ‘Despicable’ In Google's case, the fact that the company is one of the world's largest advertising businesses and Chrome is the leading browser by market share makes some publishers and advertisers nervous. Some legal experts have even raised the possibility that it might breach anti-trust rules. Although the search giant points out that the definition of which ads are acceptable comes from an independent industry group called the Coalition for Better Ads, some believe that the default blocking of certain ads puts too much power in Google's hands. Apple doesn't have a huge digital advertising business the way Google does, and its browser is the third or fourth player in the market based on recent estimates. So it would be harder to make the case that Apple's choice to not show auto-playing videos is anti-competitive. That said, however, Apple has a large and powerful user base, and the fact that it is using that power to remove certain forms of advertising—and tools that advertisers and publishers use, such as user tracking—is bound to set off alarm bells in the industry. Apple announces that Safari browser will block autoplay video ads. nice for Internet users, sucks for media businesses.... #wwdc2017- Daniel Roberts (@readDanwrite) June 5, 2017 Although it is a small player in relative terms, Apple sparked much of the current outcry about ad-blocking software when it made iOS 9 compatible with third-party ad blockers in 2015. Ad-blocking in general, on both the desktop and mobile web, has been growing rapidly over the past couple of years, according to industry surveys. Users on mobile devices in particular are not happy with the time-consuming and intrusive ads that many sites rely on to make money. Publishers, meanwhile, argue that they have no choice but to use these annoying features, because Google and Facebook have taken over so much of the digital-advertising market. According to one industry analyst, the two companies combined have about 75% of the $70-billion U.S. digital advertising market, and between the two of them, they accounted for virtually all of the growth in the industry last year.

[Update: Fixed] It's not just you—there's a widespread Google Home outage Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 12:04pm PDTJun 5, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares53 Google Google Home News Update 1: 2017/06/05 12:10pm PDT Fixed Google spent a lot of time at I/O talking about Assistant and Google Home. In fact, it gave a free Home to everyone who attended I/O. Today, a lot of those devices are spitting out errors instead of controlling smart home devices and answering questions. According to multiple online complaints, there's a Google Home outage affecting a significant portion of users. You'll know instantly if your Home is affected. Use the trigger phrase and it'll respond with "Hmm, something went wrong. Try again in a few seconds," or "There was a glitch. Try again in a few seconds." Most users say the issues started popping up in the last day or two—I began getting errors last night, and today Google Home has a nearly 100% failure rate. Interestingly, this seems to only affect Google Home. Other devices with Assistant work fine, so you can still control your devices if you've got a phone handy. Some owners report a hard reset of Home fixed the issue, but many others still have problems after resetting. Google is aware of the outage, so it'll probably be fixed soon. It's pretty annoying in the meantime, though. Update 1: 2017/06/05 12:10pm PDT Fixed Google has updated the thread to say all issues have been addressed. If you still have problems, try restarting.

Duder12 Hows that multi user support working out? Daniel Yeah, using Bing must be awesome Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Actually, I added an "Ask Google" skill, and I never use it. That's how useful I find googling with an Echo. Dave Stines I have both. My wife uses the echo for music in the kitchen at this point. Echo can't hear half of what I say. Home responds so much better I only use it now. Plus the info you get. I use it constantly. I have a very smart home. Lights, sprinkler system, etc tu3218 Air freshener or not, at least it looks like it belongs in a home. Echo belongs in a garage. abc A comment with 13 upvotes ranks lower than the top comment which has only 4 upvotes. One can imagine how many butthurt Google fanboys must have downvoted this comment. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All of them. ericshmerick How's the sodium level of that snack? Salty? Salty. Jay It has been a very annoying couple of days. My whole house runs on my Google home. Lights, temperature, TV, music. Having to use 6 different apps again sucks. RyanWhitwam You can use Assistant on your phone, right? Jay Yeah, but when I say ok Google, the Google home takes over as well and it starts speaking loudly and the assistant on my phone listens to home and it's a mess. RyanWhitwam Ah yes, the age-old problem. I just use the long-press on my phone now. Trigger word is for Home only. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Jay I'm going to start using the long press a lot more often. Tyler Hardeman you could, you know, just unplug the google home for now until things resolve themselves. Jay It's not that big of a deal, just annoying. Besides, it's Google they usually fix most problems within a day at most. Like I said I still have the standalone apps for myself, the rest of my family is going to have to deal with it for the time being. Ramon Restart it Jay Ive tried that a few times already icyhotmike When's the last time you tried? Jay About 5 minutes ago. Ramon Just restart the Google Home via the Home app, I'm back up since last night. Duder12 Didn't work for me obk88 didnt work for me either Jared H. I've factory reset 3 times. Helps for a few minutes to a few hours before reoccurring. Glad AP posted this or I'd have probably done something drastic.... Christopher Young Thank for you helping ensure my sanity. I've restarted both of my Google Homes, reset my router with no results. Justin Dybedahl Same here. I just bought one and hooked it up 15 minutes ago. Been driving me nuts. Lol yentrog31 Glad I really don't use it for anything really useful. So far just a gimmick since my shopping doesn't list in my Keep anymore. It's great for telling you the time or the weather though! Jakob Emerick They moved it without telling anybody. Your shopping list is tucked away in Google Express now. Noble My home has had only 15% success rate for a full week at least, its so annoying when it can't control your lights! James Briano It's an annoying product. I finally took mine out of the box when the folks who gifted it to me were coming for a visit. The most appropriate thing it's ever done was play "You Can't Always Get What You Want" on Play Music when I asked it to play the "Transparent" soundtrack on Spotify. Trolled so hard. B2discus I restarted it. It works when I cast to it. If I talk to it, the phone picks up and drops off the connection. VAVAMk_2 Mine is working Ruperto17 This has been happening to me for at least 2-3 weeks. The failure rate is about 70%. Its driving me nuts!! Spencer I've been having the same issue. I'm considering switching it from my 5Ghz network to my 2.4Ghz just to see if that makes a difference... Adam Cain I had this happen earlier today. A power cycle resolved the issue for me. Jon Fridman Google keeps telling me to try again every other command. I thought my Google Home was having connectivity issues at first, now I'm glad it's a known issue. russjr08 Mine is working fine, though I wasn't happy when the OTA update came through at 2AM and caused it to play the startup chime. Curtis Bond So this is what worked for me. Every time I used the hot-phrase it would spit out the same error, but once my wife used the hot-phrase, it started working perfectly. After that neither of us had issues. I'm pretty sure it's a software problem that's related to voice recognition. Also, big ups to AP for posting this. If Google is going to be serious about consumer electronics, they've got to stay on top of nonsense like this. A widespread failure like this should be unacceptable, and frankly should have been fixed already. Kyle Kepner I have five Google homes and 3 of them are wonky right now. Resets did not help ericshmerick Resetting will do nothing. It's a problem with ~the cloud~ LondonLeedsFan Is this feature available in the UK? Bruce Wayne And we want to trust these people to drive our cars autonomously. LOL. YuCMi Wouldn't it just chill your spine to hear your car saying, "Hmmm, something went wrong," while on a busy expressway? Đức Thành If you ever consider writing a script for a horror movie, please know that I'd like to read it and direct its movie. Just saying. YaKillaCJ I would rather have Wayne Tech JD Seeing as how they had Real life RC-able atomic powered cars in 1966 and a fully automatic self driving voice controlled car by 1989 I approve. DJ JoJo I was able to get mine working by going into home app, clicking upper right devices button. Next to Google home pic was "ready for multi user" prompt. I clicked it and trained my voice and it's working with no problems now. I had already power cycled and rebooted but that didn't work until I clicked on prompt. Defenestratus it didn't work for me for literally 3 minutes. Then it worked again. abc To be fair, it's a beta product. Bugs can happen. :) SunnyStroker Yep, that's Google! Always half Baked, always in Beta. Daniel Including Android right? I think we can cut them some slack considering how many things they give us for free. JD Its not free You are the product #productception KSubedi Almost returned mine because of that because I thought mine was defective unit. drkarlp I had mine for 9 months....I think it happened once - I re booted and all was fine. I love Google Home ! ericshmerick Wow...a positive poster. Everything okay? Garrett Johnson Fun fact. Holding the Microphone off button for 15 will do a factory data reset. According to Google's help center page you can not do a FDR from the app. Only reboot. That being said it didn't fix it for me Lars Jeppesen No issues on my GHomes located in Denmark and Brazil. Maybe a US only thing? John "OK Google, add HomePod to my shopping list." "Umm, something went wrong." ericshmerick All 3 of mine have been instantly throwing an error when I say "Hey Google." Been going on for a few days. Maddening. Markg55 All fixed. That was quick. JD My echo is working just fine thx JD Must have something to do with the prep for their Canadian launch... #blamecanada Frawlz Mine is still bugging out.

[Deal Alert] Get a $75 credit when spending $750 or more on a Pixel with Google Store Financing Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 8:04am PDTJun 5, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 27 Share on Facebook 25 Share on Twitter Total Shares62 Deals Google Pixel Pixel XL The Pixel is a great phone, but it's not sold by most carriers. Google make it a little easier to afford this device by making financing available. It's rare that Google discounts devices on the Google Store, but you can get $75 off a Pixel right now if you use financing. There are some caveats, but not as many as most carrier deals. The deal requires you to spend at least $750—the Pixel XL would certainly fulfill that, but a 128GB regular Pixel should work too. Hey, or you could just buy a few Pixels. Your call. Just sign up for Google Store Financing and keep your account in good standing. After two billing cycles, you'll get an account credit for $75. This deal also entitles you to the free Pixel case, which Google started a week or two ago. The Pixel is getting a bit old, and maybe you shouldn't hop on that train anymore. Still, this is a good deal. Source: Google Store Tags deals Google google store pixel pixel xl subscribe ...

I'll stick to the essentials Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Watch out, Spigen might sue you! Aaron With the LCD display, lack of waterproofing and ugly screen mounted selfie can, I'm really not seeing any essential for me. Rawhi Mohammad Good points.. to be honest, I'm looking forward to the uglycam, waterproofing yes, that would have been nice. LCD.. that might suck, I'm used to my AMOLED. But it won't hurt to try it out and see for myself. Aaron Hey I'm definitely not angry about another premium vendor on the market. And there's a lot to be excited about here. But about like the first gen Pixels, I was hoping for a little more. Rawhi Mohammad Definitely agree.. they could've justified it's price by tackling all these points. Wonder if anyone ever will BinaryTB Maybe if it was a Pixel C, who knows if Google will announce another tablet, so might as well get the only pure Android tablet currently available. T4rd New battery definitely revived my 6P. Went from this with early shutdowns at 10-30%: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e2cf19817b113fda177a0371891906cc98537e17585ef51f9862d7c355c8837.png To this with 4-5 hours SoT again and no early shutdowns: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d935df6962acf507febc9d3ee4bb9a7deb1c8c5b91fe814c91768238d96f1966.png Edit: Opps, replied to wrong comment, hah. But I see Edgar replied anyways below. Edgar Martin Hope it fixes mine also. Two more days until I get a new battery. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4c60dbd62abb2ed4ae54165974d0fe71c8b31a84df4ffa732379c98e1a7b3d6a.png T4rd Damn, that's pretty bad. So does it really only last like 1 hour of SoT then? lol Edgar Martin If that. Lol. It's on the charger most of the time. ☹️ Jay That's really bad. 😮 Tom Z Here's how bad mine has gotten. I just purchased a Nexus 5x from Newegg to hold me over until the Pixel 2 arrives. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ebfe8d90329e8d0be031b0030b1000ba8c797240fb1238e0ce206802427b2b5a.png T4rd Wow.. you know Google is replacing 6Ps out of warranty because of this, right? Or you could have just got that $10 6P battery I posted below and had a local repair place put it in for you for much less than that 5X costs. Jason Pagliaro Mine went into the reboot loop of death this weekend, sadly. Battery was getting bad but no early shutdowns, at least. TheDrunkenClam Is it easy to do this replacement? Plombir It's not easy for sure plus you need tools as well. I will just get a battery and take my phone to a reputable shop to get it installed. asianrage Most likely, get a replacement back and glass and such. The chance of damaging that visor is very high. T4rd It's not hard IMO, but I've had a bit of experience repairing phones, tablets, and other electronics too and it does require some basic phone repair tools; heat gun/blow dryer, plastic wedges/guitar picks, super thin metal pry tool or x-acto knife, and a small screw driver. Most phone parts come with most of these tools (my battery from eBay did), but I've acquired many from past repairs I've done. I replace the battery in my previous One M8 too, which was considerably harder than this 6P since you had to completely disassemble the phone sans the display to get to it. Fortunately on the 6P, once you get the housing off, the battery is easy to get to and replace from there. The hardest part on this phone is removing the bottom plastic panel and top glass without damaging anything (much). So it's important to have a super thin knife or tool to pry these pieces out.. I had to make due with a box cutter blade and got it off with minimal damage to the housing. Anfronie I'm thinking of doing this soon. Where can I get an reputable OEM battery that is not a knockoff? I don't want to do all that work if the replacement battery is crap. Thanks for any info! T4rd I got this one: http://www.ebay.com/itm/252482757101?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT Looked EXACTLY like the original OEM battery and a few others in this Reddit thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/66tzgh/if_youre_on_the_fence_about_replacing_your/#bottom-comments) bought that one as well with the same results as I have had. You can see pics of it there too next to the original battery. Anfronie Thanks a ton for the info! :D John Doe Google sent me a 15% discount "just for you" off of the Pixel XL. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6f6e48720cee18cef32533cfd87278a84f7cb2d33eb3bdfa5289ad659e1c1908.png Good_Ole_Pinocchio You didn't use it did you? John Doe No of course not LoL Edgar Martin Hopefully getting the battery replaced in my Nexus 6P this Wednesday will allow me to hold off until the next Pixel is release... If not then Pixel XL it is. T4rd It's annoying that Google refuses to discount their Pixel devices. The Pixel C is now a major rip-off at $600 and almost 2 years old. Makes you wonder if or how much they'll discount the current Pixel phones when the new ones come out. I'm guess they'll take a generous $100 off their current prices, lol. Good_Ole_Pinocchio They won't... they'll just replace them with the New Pixel. T4rd Probably.. which would be for the best considering they still can't even keep stock of them now, let alone when they're superseded. Jason Pagliaro And use the remaining inventory for warranty replacements. Cael What inventory? Jason Pagliaro Everything except the 5" black seem to be in stock unless I'm missing something. Chris G Hope they bring the financing option to Canada this year with the pixel 2. exzacklyright Pixel 2 tho... Might as well wait JG Yeah... Too bad they probably won't let us open a financing account now and start paying ahead for the Pixel 2... Get the $75 credit in August... Have half (or a fourth, depending if you do 1 or 2yrs) of the Pixel 2 paid off by the time it's released... Would result in less of a sting to the check book, especially Taimen turns out to be a tablet, about time to replace my Nexus 9... me me oooh I so need to spend $750. Cowboydroid Sad, Google. Just sad. James Briano Boss to Johnson: "I want you to handle all the Pixel sales. ALL the Pixel sales!" Johnson to his broker: "Put all my money in Samsung. ALL my money." Badouken Just need my 6P to last til end of October for the Pixel 2 to release! atc-tech Lol... "DEAL!" yeah.... Bruce Wayne Lol. $750 on a Pixel. abc $750 for a year old phone that was overpriced to start with. Ridiculous. Testraindrop Deal Alert? Spending 750$ or more for a Pixel? Now? Why? There are so many alternatives. D.Smithee lol--$750 or more on a Pixel. Never gonna happen. WAY overpriced. Ray $1400+ here in a Australia for a 128gb XL. Absolute fraud I tell you. As much I would be willing to buy one now, it would need to be half that before I'd even consider it.

Google family calendars are going live Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 3:27pm PDTJun 3, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 140 Share on Facebook 80 Share on Twitter Total Shares248 Google News Last month, Google consolidated all of its family-sharing products under the new Family groups feature. From the new Family page, you can easily manage who has access to YouTube TV, Keep notes, content from Google Play, and more. Another component of Family groups, a shared calendar, is going now live for some users. The premise behind the family calendar is simple. When you create a family on Google, a calendar called 'Family' automatically appears for all members in Google Calendar. Anyone in the family can modify events and rename the calendar, but non-family members cannot be added. While this isn't a groundbreaking feature, as sharing a calendar between Google accounts has been possible for years, this does make sharing events between family members a bit simpler. In addition, this also avoids duplicate calendar events when one member shares an event with another. Let us know if you have it in the comments below.

Artem Russakovskii If you have a significant other, you needed to invite them to stuff, which would create a duplicate event in their calendar. Then they'd reply yes, which would create an extra notification for yourself. Now imagine you've set up calendar sharing like I have. I see my wife's, she sees mine - a common use case. Our calendars are filled with duplicate events. If you have more adult family members, it gets even messier. Family calendar resolve these duplication issues for us - it's a fantastic addition. keithzg Fair enough, although I was never necessarily assuming there weren't permutations to this that would be helpful to other people. In my own instance the "Family" group is my parents and my sister, who lives in an entirely different city. I can't think of a single situation where this setup would have been that helpful. What I remain unclear on, though, is how this resolves things better than if you and your wife had a shared calendar that you put common events into, since isn't this just essentially a pre-created such calendar? Artem Russakovskii Damn. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. catalysto How is this different from just creating a single calendar to share? You can already do that with anyone (I thought). It allows for a single event to be shown only once on each person's calendar -- no duplicates. Artem Russakovskii That's... a fair point. I'm not sure why it's better or worse, actually. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. makapav Actually - the invitation feature to my wife/kids works great - because it results in an actionable item and a response. I can push back to my wife as 'tentative' or decline and still have it on my calendar and have acted on it as opposed to stuff just appearing on my calendar without notice. John O’Gara This is exactly what my wife asked me when she read about the feature. We had been using several shared calendars for our household for years now. Grey Why not resolve that issue of inviting creating a duplicate issue rather than introduce this shared calendar? And then leave inviting people creating duplicate events? Anyway, I think everything will change with the Google Calendar refresh, so discussing this might be a moot point. random I never really saw a need to invite my wife to shared events. We share our calendars at the highest permission level, and if there is something that we both do, it sits on one calendar and we know that it applies to both. Merlyn Nak-nak Clemente Ich bin der Mann der euch das Angstspürren spüren läst.meine Frau ist mir scheiss egal.meine kinder sind mir wischtiger erptastic k. Kettir Someone pls translate this properly. Google translate says his kids are wiping him and his wife is the s**t??? Maybe he feels your pain? IDK keithzg Weird how you somehow managed to avoid capitalizing words in the positions where normally both in English and auf Deutsch you would have capitalized them. Closely relatedly, the lack of spaces postpending your sentences is an odd choice. Artem Russakovskii Went live for me today. Finally no more inviting my wife to all the stuff we do together. Peter I'm too lazy to check, but i assume this isn't available to G Suite accounts? Peter To answer my own question, yeah GSuite not supported. keithzg Yeah, but you have Hangouts Chat whereas we all know that Hangouts is gonna eventually stop working for the rest of us, so it all balances out ;) Deborahthampton Google is paying 97$ per hour!

It's a true modern chat service from Google with lots of necessary base features AND new and exciting features. It's what Allo should have been if the dev team didn't focus on Stickers. keithzg See, that would make a lot of sense, which is why knowing Google's messaging strategy we can be assured it will not happen. Bru [971] "If Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone." Maybe Google is trying to save the few conversation Billy still has with his parents when he's not playing video games haha keithzg One of the problems is that family members are not notified when an event changes, so if Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone. Hmm, but in the screenshot right above in the article it shows a checkbox saying "Changed events: receive an update when somebody changes an event." If that's only actually for if somebody outside of the Family Group changes an event, that's pretty bad wording on Google's part. Corbin Davenport Nope, I was originally wrong. Fixed the post.

C'mon guys and gals GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!!!! Bill Latronica I always wonder why money paying G Suite account holders don't get these features first. Makes no sense to me. (Grumble Grumble) Tv One feature I'd like to see with this is the ability to disable individual family members on specific Google products. For example, we have the grandparents as part of our family group. The "Family Group" sharing is useful for Play Music and Photos, but they don't need to be part of shared Keep and Calendar items. Jeffrey Linton As a few others pointed out a new shared calendar that I labeled "Family" I added years ago was my answer. Any events that the whole family needs to be aware of goes there, I also added that calendar to extended family that wants to know when the kids events are to come see them. With the "Family Group" calendar I wouldn't be able to do that unless I also added them to the family group, which I didn't want to do. Auburngirl Great addition but you can't share the ical to Outlook, so I can't see it with my work calendar. That is a big problem. Patel Nisha I had this 2 weeks ago and kept getting failed email emails doing with the family. I hope they fixed whatever problem that was.

Apple is stuffing its beloved Siri into an Internet-connected speaker in what is the digital giant's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker was  unveiled at a conference for software programmers on Monday, and will go head-to-head-to-head with Amazon and Google's popular digital home assistants. NEW IMAC PRO APPLE'S MOST POWERFUL EVER But of course Apple says its siri-based system tops them all because it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. Not surprisingly, there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. SIRI SOUNDS LIKE A DUDE But it all comes for a fairly hefty price. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. So that speaker better sounds pretty nice. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year.

Mark Lennihan, File AP Photo People June 05, 2017 8:50 PM Apple's HomePod speaker pumps up the volume on tech rivals By MICHAEL LIEDTKE and BARBARA ORTUTAY AP Technology Writers LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story SAN JOSE, Calif. Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers — the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad — all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said. MACS, PHONES AND PAYMENTS Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones.

More Apple's HomePod speaker pumps up the volume on tech rivals by: MICHAEL LIEDTKE and BARBARA ORTUTAY, AP Technology Writers Updated: Jun 5, 2017 - 8:47 PM SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers - the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad - all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said. MACS, PHONES AND PAYMENTS Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. __ Ortutay reported from New York. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, Apple's HomePod speaker will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes.

KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones.

Source: Shutterstock The new feature to Google Chrome will allow it to block ads that are obtrusive. This will include ones that auto-play videos with sound, as well as pop-up ads and others. Google won’t be the sole company that determines if an ad isn’t appropriate. The Coalition for Better Ads , which Google is a member of, will handle that. This group also includes Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), The Washington Post and others. The decision to block some ads for Google Chrome users is the company’s own way of cleaning up the internet. It also has a tool available for websites and ad providers to alert them if their ads will be blocked. Google doesn’t believe that the new feature should be considered an ad blocker. Instead it claims that it is an ad filter. The goal of the project is to create a system that will hopefully keep users from relaying heavily on normal ad blockers, reports The Verge. “In dialogue with the Coalition and other industry groups, we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018,” Sridhar Ramaswamy, Senior Vice President of Ads & Commerce at Google, said in a blog post. Google will also be introducing a way for users to donate money to websites that they visit. However, it is unlikely that this feature will see much use.

The browser’s new “intelligent tracking prevention,” meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. Watch the watch: Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Filed in: National & World, News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Google Pinterest Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Here's what we know about the release date, price, and specs. by Dominic Preston | 05 Jun 17 Contents > When is the HomePod release date? > How much does it cost? > What does it look like? > What features does it have? Apple is finally getting into the smart home speaker business with the HomePod, its rival to the Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have driven popularity for their Siri alternatives. Much like its rivals, the Siri-enabled speaker will be able to respond to voice commands and play music, set alarms, control smart devices, and search for information online. What makes the HomePod stand out is that Apple claims it will blow the competition away on sound quality, so you don't have to sacrifice your speaker just to make it smart. Here's everything we know about the Apple HomePod, including features, release date and expected UK price. When is the HomePod release date? After months of speculation, Apple officially announced the HomePod at its WWDC 2017 developer conference, and took the opportunity to announce the release window: December 2017. The company didn't confirm a specific date for the launch, but did announce that it would initially be available in the US, UK, and Australia, with more markets to follow in 2018. How much does it cost? The HomePod will cost $349 in the US when it launches in December, though Apple hasn't yet confirmed UK pricing - we'd expect it to be pretty close to £349 though. That's markedly more expensive than the nearest rivals. The Amazon Echo is priced at £149.99/$179.99, with the cheaper Echo Dot available for £49.99/$49.99, while Google Home is £129/$129. What does it look like? Echoing speculation in the weeks running up to its announcement - and in line with the designs chosen by rivals Amazon and Google - Apple has opted for a cylindrical design for the HomePod. Available in either White or Space Grey, the HomePod stands just under 7 inches tall, and is covered almost head to toe in a "seamless 3D mesh fabric," just leaving space at the top for the Siri interface - a small screen that lights up with a Siri waveform when she's assisting you with something. Contrary to some rumours, there's no obvious touch screen - the top section includes touch controls for Siri, but there's certainly no substantial screen similar to Amazon's Echo Show. What features does it have? During the WWDC 2017 announcement, Apple made a great deal of the HomePod's musical functionality, going so far as to claim that the smart speaker will "reinvent home music." To start with, that comes from the speaker itself. It features a 4in, Apple-designed upward-facing woofer paired with an array of seven beam-forming tweeters, each with its own amplifier. During the announcement, Apple compared the HomePod to the Sonos range of wireless speakers, suggesting that Apple is confident the HomePod is of a similar audio quality. The speaker itself is backed by spatial awareness technology, powered by an A8 chip, which apparently means the HomePod can analyse the room its in and optimise the audio output so that it sounds the best it can for whatever room its in. It apparently works even better if you have two (or more?) HomePods in the same room, as they'll work together to create the best sound possible. Of course, all of that just makes for a good speaker - what makes the HomePod special is that its a smart, Siri-powered speaker. That means it can connect to Apple Music and all of your other Apple services to serve as a home assistant. There are six microphones built into the top ring of the device so that it can pick up your voice from anywhere in the room, even over music, and a Siri waveform will appear on the top section (which doubles as touch controls) when she's responding to one of your queries. When it comes to music, that means it can do things like play a certain song, album, artist, or genre on command; let you know things like when a song was recorded or who the drummer was; and even just 'play more like this'. Beyond that, the smart functionality is similar to what you're already used to from Siri. The HomePod can be used to set reminder, answer questions, or check the weather. It can also integrate to all your HomeKit-compatible appliances to become the hub of your smart home. Apple also made a point of emphasising its approach to privacy and security. It claims that the HomePod will only send any information to Apple's servers after 'Hey Siri' is recognised, and that even then it will be "encrypted and sent using an anonymous Siri identifier."

Like devices by Amazon and Google, Apple's HomePod speaker can respond to questions and control smart home gadgets such as lights. Analysts say Apple has been slow to improve its Siri virtual assistant and launch a smart speaker, after Amazon launched its Echo in 2014. The company has pitched HomePod first and foremost as a music player. Dave Lee's review: Superb sound, but how smart? "Apple is being very clever by launching its Siri speaker as a music speaker that's smart, because Siri isn't great," said Tom Warren from the technology news site The Verge. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionWatch: Apple also showed off its iPad Pro multi-tasking feature "Interesting that home assistant was the last feature they talked about. Focusing on music is smart, main use case for smart speakers," said Ben Bajarin, of the Creative Strategies consultancy. The announcement was made at the tech giant's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California. "It's a logical step for Apple, to ensure that they don't miss the opportunity to get a smart device right in the centre of people's homes," said Ben Wood, an industry analyst at CCS Insight. "There has been a huge amount of hype around Amazon Echo and Google Home, but we are really at the start of this technology. "This does a great job of extending the tentacles of Apple services." Analysis - Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, at WWDC At more than double the cost of Amazon's Echo, the HomePod is a typical Apple move. The company is once again banking on its reputation as a creator of intuitive, luxury products that justify a hefty price tag. What's interesting about Apple's approach here is that the company has positioned HomePod as a music device first and foremost, a big contrast to the approach of Google which touted its Home speaker as a day-to-day assistant for many aspects of your life. So - a cynic might say Apple has just launched the world's most-hyped bluetooth speaker - not much imagination there. But let's face it, before AI and machine learning really matures, most home assistant devices are essentially voice-controlled speakers, and so Apple dedicating its effort into making it sound great is probably a smart move. Then again, you might wonder if its "smart" capabilities are being downplayed due to Siri just not being as advanced as its competitors. Mixed reality Tools that let app designers add virtual objects to a real-world view from the phone's camera, in real time, were also revealed. The mobile game Pokemon Go is a well-known example of mixed-reality technology in action. Image copyright APple Image caption ARkit will let people place virtual objects over a real-world view Apple said the new ARkit would make use of the dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus, making the integration of virtual objects and the real world more realistic. "By truly enabling all modern iPhones to become augmented reality platforms, Apple will have the largest potential reach for AR development day one," said Mr Bajarin. However, he questioned the practicality of augmented reality on a smartphone. "The benefit to a headset or glasses in these demos is not having to hold the device up thus arms getting tired," he said. Safety in the car Apple also announced the next version of its mobile operating system - iOS 11 - which will include a new setting for people who use their iPhone in the car. In January, the company was sued by a US couple whose daughter was killed by a driver allegedly using FaceTime on his iPhone. The new driving mode silences notifications, turns the phone's display off, and can automatically reply to messages to warn friends that you are driving.

Apple also announced: a deal bringing the Amazon Prime Video streaming service to the Apple TV set-top box an update to its Safari web browser, which will now stop websites from tracking visitors and stop videos playing automatically speed upgrades to its iMac and Macbook range of computers, plus a new iMac Pro which the company says is the most powerful Mac ever made Related Topics Apple Apps Share this story About sharing Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn More on this story Apple's HomePod: Superb sound, but how smart? 6 June 2017 Video Amazon Echo speakers set to launch in UK and Germany 14 September 2016 Google Home to be launched in UK in April 28 March 2017 Top Stories Comey testifies on Trump and Russia The ex-FBI chief is at a Senate hearing on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election. 8 June 2017 WATCH: Ex-FBI chief Comey testifies 8 June 2017 Video shows police shooting London attackers 8 June 2017 Features Four days behind the Taliban front line The 81-year-old woman inspiring a nation to recycle Can you be taught to be more charismatic?

The iPhone giant unveiled a device called the HomePod, a next generation voice-controlled music speaker that will be its first major new product category since it unveiled the Apple Watch in 2014. The HomePod marks a fightback against Amazon’s Echo, the voice-controlled Wi-Fi speaker that has been a surprise hit and put rivals such as Apple and Google on the back foot. Critics have accused Apple of being behind the curve on smart speakers, which are powered by artificial intelligence systems, leading to fears that it could miss out on the generation of gadgets that could follow the smartphone. Apple sought to position the HomePod as an extension of its musical heritage, with the device’s name a play on the original iPod music player. It features a high-definition speaker and runs the Apple Music streaming service, features the company hopes will give it an edge against the Echo and Google’s rival Home device. The HomePod speaker can adapt its sound based on the size and shape of a room, Apple said Credit: AP The speaker is powered by Apple’s virtual assistant software, Siri. As well as playing music, it can respond to spoken commands to send text messages, check the news or control smart home devices. The HomePod, which will be released in December and cost $349 (£270), was unveiled at Apple’s annual developer conference in San Jose, where the company also unveiled a spate of new software features and gadget upgrades. Updates to the iPhone’s operating system included a money transfer service that allows users to send cash to one another, the latest in Apple’s move into financial services after the launch of Apple Pay.  Apple created additional features in iOS 11 designed for the iPad Credit: Apple The company overhauled the App Store and its Apple Music streaming service and improved its Siri assistant with features such as language translation. Apple updated its range of iMac computers with a power boost that gives them virtual reality capabilities, as well as refreshing its line of MacBook laptops with faster processors. It also unveiled a new version of the iPad Pro, its high-powered tablet, with a slimmer design and a 10.5-inch screen, a third size option in addition to the 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch versions already on the market. Apple is promoting the iPad Pro as a potential laptop replacement as it seeks to reverse falling sales of the tablet. Last night, it also updated the iPad iOS operating system with computer-grade features such as a PC-style file system. Apple chief executive Tim Cook on stage at WWDC Credit: Reuters A new version of the Apple Watch software will centre on the wearable device’s exercise capabilities and artificial intelligence, and updates to the Mac computer software included changes to its Safari web browser that limited how advertisers could track users across websites.  Apple, which boasts a market value of $815bn, is looking for new sources of growth as sales of the iPhone, which provides most of its revenue, stall. It has recorded falling sales of its flagship handset for four straight quarters, and last year it posted its first decline in annual profits for 15 years. Sales of the iPad tablet have fallen consistently since 2013, and while the Apple Watch, has easily outsold competitors, it has not proved a hit on the scale of the iPhone or iPad. Executives have talked up the strength of its software and services business, which includes app sales, Apple Music and Apple Pay, and aims to double revenues to around $50bn a year by 2021. Apple shares fell 1pc.

Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected s... SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera - the same one found in the iPhone 7 - along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches - but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Who's hired? Check our People in Business Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches — but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera - the same one found in the iPhone 7 - along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches - but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Apple unveils new voice assistant voice Published June 05, 2017 Fox News Facebook Twitter Comments Email Print  (Reuters) Siri's voice is changing. Apple's famously female digital voice assistant will soon come with a male option, as Apple readies its own Siri-powered virtual butler to go head-to-head-to-head with Amazon's Echo and Google Home. But Siri isn't just being spruced up for the big new product launch. It will also be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple says it wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It says it will learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Not creepy at all! THE FUTURE OF THE APPLE WATCH REVEALED! Apple didn't discuss the privacy implications, though typically, the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the Internet. That's a contrast to Google's approach.

SAN JOSE: Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart'' home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, Apple's HomePod speaker will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is Apple's first new device since the company launched its smartwatch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality ``experiences.'' But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency'' format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. MAC GETS AN UPGRADE Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention,'' meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. READ MORE ON » wwdc 2017Tim CookHomePod Speakerapple wwdc 2017Apple Comments Add Your Comments NEXT STORY Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You Get a Quote Browse CompaniesABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ|123456789 Browse Mutual FundsABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ The Economic Times Live Market News Portfolio Mobile Live TV Newsletter Commodities Speed QnA Blogs Alerts RSS Other Times Group news sitesTimes of India|इकनॉमिक टाइम्स ઈકોનોમિક ટાઈમ્સ|Mumbai Mirror Times Now|Indiatimes नवभारत टाइम्स|महाराष्ट्र टाइम्स ವಿಜಯ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ|Lifehacker Gizmodo|Eisamay|IGN India NavGujarat Samay Living and entertainmentTimescity|iDiva|Zoom| Luxpresso|Gaana|Happytrips| Cricbuzz|Get Smartapp Networkingitimes|MensXP.com Hot on the WebICC Champions Trophy Live Score|Narendra Modi in Russia Top 10 mutual funds|RERA Xiaomi Redmi 4 Review|BSE Sensex Gold rate today Servicesads2book|Gadgetsnow|Free Business Listings Simplymarry|Astrospeak|Timesjobs|Magicbricks|Zigwheels|Timesdeal| dineout|Filmipop|Remit2india|Gaana|Greetzap|Techradar|Alivear| Google Play | Manage Notifications About us/Advertise with us/Terms of Use & Grievance Redressal/Privacy Policy/Feedback/Sitemap/Code of Ethics//Disclaimer Copyright © 2017 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, California (AP) — Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new “smart” home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The “HomePod” speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple “can’t afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. Keeping it real with VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple’s annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality “experiences.” But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple’s entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. New iPhone features New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Mac gets an upgrade Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple’s web browser, seeks to make users’ online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn’t be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser’s new “intelligent tracking prevention,” meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. Sizing up the iPad Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn’t. Yet it isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Watch the watch Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Never miss another Facebook post from WISH-TV Share this: Facebook Google Email Print More Pinterest Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

By Joshua Benton @jbenton June 5, 2017, 3:33 p.m. June 5, 2017, 3:33 p.m. Apple went the first five full months of 2017 without a public event to announce new products, so there was a backup of things to talk about at today’s overstuffed WWDC keynote. As usual, a few of the announcements had impacts on the publishing business; here are the highlights. HomePod: Apple led its presentation (and picked the name) of the HomePod with music in mind — putting it in a historical line with iTunes and iPods rather than the Amazon Echo. (Its first stated requirement was to “rock the house.”) In the same way the Apple Watch sells fitness as the hook to get a computer strapped on your wrist, HomePod sells music to get a microphone in your home — and for many people, music will be all it gets used for. But it also features the same sort of voice interaction patterns we’ve become familiar with with the Echo and Google Home. That includes some news elements; check out this slide of things you can say to your HomePod — asking for sports results, tuning into NPR, playing podcasts, and “tell me the latest news” are all options: There was no particular announcement in the keynote about Siri expanding to new classes of apps — though that could easily be something that is announced to developers later in the week or in developer docs just posted. So it’s unclear how open access to these queries will be. (“Hey Siri, ask The New York Times what’s going on in Syria.” “Hey Siri, ask Vox to explain healthcare reform in six minutes.”) But either now or at some point soon, publishers will likely have to decide whether Siri and the HomePod are worth developing for. (Update: The new SiriKit docs say only list-making and note-taking — “Hey Siri, add milk to my shopping list in Things” — are newly supported, so integration with news apps still seems to be theoretical.) Before investing in building for a platform, publishers like to have an idea how large the addressable market will be. Amazon, the clear leader, doesn’t release sales numbers for its devices (just like the Bezos-owned Washington Post doesn’t tell anyone how many digital subscribers it has, grumble grumble). eMarketer estimates Amazon has 70 percent of the U.S. market, and Morgan Stanley estimated 11 million units sold back in December, pre-holiday rush, the vast majority of them in the United States. Google Home is at a fraction of that. Amazon has made building Alexa skills quite easy, and its lower price point will likely keep it unthreatened as the market leader (the HomePod will go for $349 when it launches in December). But by putting the HomePod on the Siri platform, developing for it will likely also be able to take advantage of the huge installed base of iPhone and iPad customers. It’s worth watching what sort of access Apple allows developers; if it’s decent, it’s probably worth the time of an engineer or two at most or the largest publishers. Safari: The new Safari features a couple features of interest to publishers. First, it blocks autoplay videos; Craig Federighi said that Apple will learn over time what sites “shouldn’t” have autoplay — presumably excluding video sites like YouTube. Perhaps more importantly (at least for the adtech world), Safari will do “intelligent tracking prevention,” which seems to be selective blockage of cross-site cookies, the “feature” that lets something you looked at in an online store follow you around the web for days. (Both of these announcements were explicitly made for Macs, but it’s hard to imagine they won’t move to iPhones and iPads at some point.) Google is heading in a similar direction with Chrome, deciding what ads can and can’t be shown in-browser. Obviously, Google (which makes 90 percent of its revenue from advertising) and Apple (which makes almost none of its) have different incentives influencing their actions — but in both cases, the tech giants who control the leading browsers are using their power to clean up an advertising experience that publishers, adtech, and advertisers haven’t been able to. That raises legitimate antitrust concerns — but it also appears to be a fait accompli at this point. Some news execs are going to see big drops in the monthly play counts, but that’s probably for the best. iOS 11: In the long run, Apple’s interested in more information workers moving from MacBooks to iPads, but the phone-born iOS hasn’t always worked too well for more significant use. (Try researching a topic across multiple websites and then writing a link-heavy blog post about them on an iPad. Can you do it? Sure. Would you want to? Probably not.) So iOS 11, announced today and coming out this fall, includes a few updates that’ll be welcomed by, say, reporters in the field. A new multitasking view, based on a rebuilt Dock, looks much more flexible. A better on-screen keyboard should make typing numbers and punctuation easier. A new Files app exposes the file system to users in a way Steve Jobs famously resisted, but which might save you a few hundred “Open In…” dialogues. (This may or may not be linked to Apple’s successful launch of a new file system, which reached macOS today. And the interface can include third-party apps like Dropbox.) Text, images, and other bits of content can now be drag-and-dropped between apps. There’s 3D Touch tab switching in Safari. It’s a package of updates that should make word-based, multi-app work significantly easier. One other note: Apple is dropping support for 32-bit apps on iOS. It’s unlikely your publisher’s app is 32-bit unless it’s sat ignored for multiple years — actually maybe it’s not that unlikely? you probably have some weird print replica thing from 2012 still in there — but if it is, it’ll stop working this fall. Apple News: The lil’ distributed-content platform that could, Apple News has been a surprise hit with publishers and audiences alike, with outlets reporting big audiences, especially from push notifications. No big updates made the keynote threshold, but there was an interesting mention in a section about iOS. Siri — which seems to be getting a rebranding from a voice interface to a Google Assistant-style pan-device intelligence system — can now detect what you’re looking at in Safari and suggest news articles about them. The example given was someone searching for travel information about Reykjavík in Safari and then being prompted with Iceland-related news in Apple News. Some evil genius will figure out the right way to take advantage of this and unleash a new dark science of…Safari-engine optimization? A couple brief mentions on a slide seem to indicate Apple News videos will now appear in the Today view (which I imagine also means a more prominent treatment for video in the Apple News app) and a new Spotlight tab in the app. Update: According to promotional materials posted after the keynote ended: News becomes even more personal, showing top stories that are more relevant to you. Siri learns what’s important to you and suggests stories you might like. And our editors choose a different topic every day for you to explore in a new tab called Spotlight. They also craft a daily selection of the best videos for you to see in Today View. Plus this image of the Spotlight tab — this is part of what new editor-in-chief Lauren Kern will be working on, presumably: Note that the current Apple News tab bar goes For You / Favorites / Explore / Search / Saved, so there’s a little bit of swapping going on here. Miscellaneous: WWDC is about software first and foremost, but there were a few hardware updates. The 9.7″ iPad Pro grew to 10.5″, with smaller bezels; the larger size means keys on the on-screen and Smart Keyboards will be full-sized. MacBooks and iMacs were all updated with faster processors; the iMac also got boosted graphics capacity that should make it more useful for high-end video and VR production, an area where Apple has lagged. The company also announced an upcoming iMac Pro, due in December, which will be even more useful. Over on the Apple Watch, Apple News is now a native watch app, meaning push notifications can be viewed in a more native and visual environment on the watch. They’ll show up in a new Siri-powered watch face. Still probably only useful to publishers as a prompt to pick up your phone, though. The iPhone’s camera app now allows a sort of fake long-exposure filter, which at least a few tripod-free photographers will find tempting. Apple announced new machine learning and augmented reality tools for developers, which sounded impressive and could be of longer-term use to a few publishers. Finally, despite my hopes, there’s were no desktop Apple News or Podcasts apps announced — a space I’m a little surprised Apple hasn’t moved into yet. (Though the iOS Podcasts app has apparently gotten a redesign — potentially key given that’s by far the most popular places for podcasts to be consumed. And, though we don’t know much about it, a WWDC on Podcasts later this week promises that “iOS 11 upgrades the Apple Podcasts app to support new feed structures for serialized shows” — interesting!)

clock menu more-arrow The 8 biggest announcements from Apple WWDC 2017 by Natt Garun@nattgarun Jun 5, 2017, 3:52pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Apple’s WWDC 2017 keynote just wrapped, where key executives Craig Federighi, Phil Schiller, and, of course, Tim Cook, took the stage to announce updates headed to iPhones, MacBooks, Apple TV, and more. The rumors for this year’s WWDC came in the final hours leading up to the event, with hints of new hardware and, of course, software news for developers to help prep the release of consumer updates in the fall. We were also anticipating the company to finally take Siri up against the likes of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant on the hardware and smart home front — and it looks like it arrived in the form of the Apple HomePod. Here are the highlights from today’s keynote. Apple announces HomePod speaker to take on Amazon Echo and Sonos So let’s get the Siri speaker rumors out of the way: it turns out Apple wasn’t quite aiming its smart speaker to go against just Amazon Echo and Google Home, but also the Sonos home entertainment speakers. Called the HomePod, it uses spacial awareness to tune and better fill the room with sound based on the space it’s in. It also has a “Musicologist” feature that works with Apple Music to stream the music you ask the speaker’s built-in Siri to play. You can even ask more complex, music-related questions like “Who’s the drummer in this song?” or “What album came out on this day 20 years ago?” Apple priced the HomePod at $349 The HomePod will be available in two colors — black or white — and will integrate Siri in an Amazon Echo / Google Home-like use case. You can ask it to control smart home devices and check the day’s weather and news briefings. Apple priced the HomePod at $349, with plans to ship it in December first to customers in the US, UK, and Australia. It will enter more international markets next year. Check out our hands-on with the HomePod for a first look. iMac Pro introduced, alongside updated desktop specs Apple’s introducing updated iMac desktops with improved Retina displays, graphics boosts, Kaby Lake processors, and USB-C. They will also support graphics for VR content creation. During the keynote, Apple demoed this by showing off a VR game featuring Darth Vader, a lightsaber, and TIE fighter. There’s a new iMac Pro as well, with a 5K display with improved cooling capacity, and 8-core Xeon processor (upgradeable up to 18-core,) up to 4TB of SSD, up to 128GB of ECC memory, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and built-in 10GB Ethernet. Apple The new iMac starts at $1,099 for the 21.5-inch model, and $1,299 for the 4K model. MacBooks will get upgraded, too; the MacBook Pro starting at $1,299, which includes the updated Kaby Lake processor. The iMac Pro starts at $4,999, and ships in December. iOS 11 comes with improved Siri, automatic Do Not Disturb driving mode, iMessage features The new version of iOS software has some pretty social updates, such as an update to Siri that has improved speech, the ability to help translate sentences into different languages, and on-device learnings that suggest actions based on what you do on your iPhone or iPad. iMessages now live in the iCloud, with synchronized conversations that you can delete from any device you own that are under the same account. You can also pay and receive payments from contacts through iMessage — so no more Venmo or Square Cash if you don’t want to download extra apps. Siri now has improved speech Photo capture is also improved, with better low-light performance, and the ability to edit Live Photos so you can change the key still image or trim the video. There’s a new control center as well, which relies a lot on 3D Touch and condenses most controls on the lower half of the screen without looking cluttered. There’s also a new safety feature that recognizes when a user is driving and automatically turns on Do Not Disturb to prevent distractions. When you’re available to be more social, you can now head to Apple Music to see what your friends are listening to and check out shared playlists. Lastly, the App Store has been redesigned for better discovery and a How To section for tips on how to use various popular apps. Apple’s also bringing back the “App of the Day” section to promote users to open the App Store more frequently. iOS 11 for iPad brings Windows-esque multitasking abilities On the iPad, iOS 11 improves multitasking that lets users pull up an app from the dock and drag it onto the screen to split the screen. Similar to what you can do on a MacBook, you can use touch to hold and drag folders, files, or photos and drop them in a different app such as Mail or iMessage. Handwritten text from an Apple Pencil will also be searchable from the Notes app. Apple claims it uses “deep learning” to recognize penmanship. Apple also talked briefly about the Files app that leaked a few hours before the keynote kicked off, which is just a management system that you can use to sort files by size and date, similar to how you’d go through your files on a desktop or laptop. Apple lets developers make more immersive apps with ARKit Just as Lauren Goode predicted, Apple introduced a new ARKit to let developers build augmented reality apps for the iPhone. The kit can help find planes, track motion, and estimate scale and ambient lighting. Popular apps like Pokémon Go will also use ARKit for improved real-time renders. Rather than requiring external hardware like Microsoft’s HoloLens, Apple seems to be betting on ARKit to provide impressive quality imaging through a device most people already own. We’ll know more on how the quality actually compares when we get to try it out ourselves. 10.5-inch iPad Pro introduced The iPad Pro will now be available in three different sizes, with a new 10.5-inch model introduced today. There’s a 12-megapixel camera, just like the iPhone 7, with a 7MP selfie cam. It supports USB 3.0 and has 10 hours of battery life. There’s a new feature called ProMotion which reduces the Apple Pencil’s latency to 20 milliseconds. It can automatically adjust the refresh rate based on what you’re watching (fast-moving video versus still image). ProMotion also doubles the refresh rate to up to 120Hz. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro will be available starting with a 64GB configuration at $649; it’s available to order now and shipping next week. The new macOS is named High Sierra. Yep. The upcoming version of macOS will be called High Sierra, and it comes with updates to Safari that help block site trackers and autoplaying videos. Apple’s also added new photo-editing tools like curves (helpful for those who don’t have Adobe Photoshop), and it has better filtering tools to sort images by keywords or faces. An updated file management system will be a part of the update as well, which speeds up directory cloning with native encryption. On the graphics end, there’s a second version of Metal, support for VR, and a Metal 2 developer kit that you can order with an AMD GPU to tune apps for external graphics. watchOS 4 brings new Siri watchface, fitness coaching, and a new app-browsing UI An update for the Apple Watch is coming which introduces new faces that display different types of informations, such as Siri reminders or more visual ones that feature Toy Story characters a la Mickey Mouse. There’s also a fitness-focused update, which includes monthly challenges to encourage the wearer to get more active and NFC-enabled data sharing where the user can tap their Apple Watch on gym equipment to pair the two, sharing the most accurate calorie burn and activity information. There’s also a new Music app to make finding and playing music via the Apple Watch more visual — you can now use a new dock layout to scroll through recently opened apps.

REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach    Google Announces Stand-Alone Virtual Reality Hardware Christopher Brooks 3:48 PM 06/05/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Google has announced virtual reality hardware that can be operated independent of a smartphone or computer. In late May, Google announced a myriad of upcoming virtual reality innovations At its yearly I/O conference in late May, Google announced its collaboration with Lenovo and HTC to develop “a new breed of VR headsets, designed to work without a phone or separate computer,” per CNET’s Ian Sherr. In his keynote speech at Google I/O, Clay Bavor, the VP of Virtual and Augmented Reality at Google, referred to these devices as “standalone headsets” that require “no cables, no phone and certainly no big PC.” Clay goes on to say that “by building every part of the device specifically for VR we have been able to optimize everything. The displays, the optics the sensors all to deliver a stronger sense of being transported.” CNET’s Scott Stein also noted that the headsets will “have built-in ‘WorldSense’ cameras that allow some room-tracking and movement,” something that other higher end virtual reality headsets can only do with sensors placed throughout a designated room. Because ‘Worldsense’ is integrated in the headset, Google’s new VR will allow the user to enjoy a full virtual reality experience with movement in any room or space. Previous iterations of VR headsets, like Facebook’s Oculus Rift, Sony’s Playstation VR, and HTC and Valve’s Vive headsets, required that the user be connected physically or wirelessly to their PC and consoles. Meanwhile more portable virtual reality headsets, like Samsung’s Gear VR and Google’s own Daydream and cardboard headsets, rely on the user’s phone being inserted in the front as a screen, a costly sacrifice to the phone’s charge that users need for various other tasks throughout the day. Google’s standalone devices may solve these issues with their new dedicated platform. For now, there has been no announced price and only a vague promise for a release later this year. But, a dedicated VR machine with motion tracking capabilities and no need to be anchored to a PC is a promising innovation in the emerging virtual reality market. With the virtual reality industry missing sales targets in 2016 according to Fortune’s Jeff Roberts, an innovation like this may usher in a new wave a virtual reality excitement and reinvigorate sales to their once projected levels.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Public pay: Compare government and teacher salaries for St. Louis area How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches — but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Apple’s $349 HomePod is being billed by the company as a way to reinvent music in the home, with an upward-facing 4-inch woofer and six microphones. Apple says the HomePod will ship in December. The company is arriving late in the game, as Google Home began shipping last year and the Amazon Echo in 2014. Roughly 10 million Amazon Echos and Google Homes have already been sold, but there’s still room for Apple to get into the growing market for such devices, according to Loup Ventures, a venture firm that has conducted research on Internet-connected home devices. “Like many other audio and platform vendors, Apple has been forced to act as its competitors are stealing the march into people’s kitchens, bedroom and living rooms with their own virtual personal assistants, while Siri has been confined to smartphones where engagement, particularly within the home, is relatively low,” wrote Simon Bryant, an associate director at Futuresource Consulting in an email.

The problem is that more consumers are interacting more with digital assistants connected to speakers for the home than they are with the digital assistants on their smartphones. But whether Apple succeeds depends on how smart Siri is and the functions that Siri can perform compared to digital assistants like Google. In a test comparing Apple’s Siri to the Google digital assistant that runs Google Home, Google bested Apple in areas like navigation, Loup Ventures said. Apple on Monday said Siri can engage with translation and is using machine learning to better assist its users in anticipating what users will text in its messaging service. Apple also said it is expanding what is available on Maps, letting people see floorplans of malls and airports in iOS11. Linn Huang, an IDC research director, said he already owns an Amazon Echo and uses it to listen to music and catch up on news. Even though he owns a lot of Apple products, he’s skeptical about how smart Siri is. He once asked Siri what to get his wife for Mother’s Day. Siri’s answer was to get her some eggs because they are a good source of protein. Latest business videos Apple executives on Monday billed the HomePod as a combination of a high-end music speaker and a digital assistant. HomePod will work with Apple’s music streaming service Apple Music, which has 27 million paid subscribers and a library of 40 million songs. The HomePod will also work with Internet-connected home devices that work with HomeKit, another Apple product. HomePod will be shipped to the U.S., the United Kingdom and Australia and come in white and gray. Wendy Lee and Benny Evangelista are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.

FILE - In this Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2011 file photo, a person stands near the Apple logo at the company's store in Grand Central Terminal, in New York. Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into peopleâ€šÃ„Ã´s homes. Tapping Appleâ€šÃ„Ã´s Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Appleâ€šÃ„Ã´s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015, Sunday, June 4, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) 00000 SAN JOSE, Calif. – The Latest on Apple’s annual conference in California (all times local): 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn’t. Yet it isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera – the same one found in the iPhone 7 – along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It’s expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It’ll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple didn’t discuss the privacy implications, though typically, the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. That’s a contrast to Google’s approach. Apple’s approach protects privacy, but might make the service less useful when switching devices. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple’s mobile software. ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple’s is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple’s Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centred on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn’t immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favour of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It’s turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That’s a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it’s expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it’s a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple’s is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more “smarts” using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from “Toy Story,” joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple’s streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon’s Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple’s annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It’s the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn’t be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor.

There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 per cent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 per cent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it’s still at fourth overall, at less than 5 per cent, just ahead of Garmin.

But some say the move to limit certain kinds of advertisements using one of the world's most popular browsers may unfairly serve Google's business interests at the cost of competing advertisers. Google says it has identified the most obnoxious types of ads in partnership with the Coalition for Better Ads, an independent group made up of trade associations and media companies, including The Washington Post, and will start blocking those ads early next year. The kinds of advertisements that will see the Google Chrome stiff-arm include pop-ups, auto-playing videos with sound and big, "sticky" ads that are pinned to the page no matter where people scroll. VIDEOS TOP JOBS It's "far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the Web - like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page," said Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's senior vice president for ads and commerce, in a blog post last week. Rather than rely on full-fledged ad blockers, which may deny publishers and advertisers a way to make money, Chrome's ad filter is designed to work as a business-friendly alternative, letting reasonable ads through but blocking the worse offenders, Ramaswamy said. However, some may question Google's intention, since it is such a powerful player in online advertising, said Andrew Frank, a research vice president at consulting and research firm Gartner. One concern is that the company could use its power as a popular Web browser to limit the kinds of ad offerings its competitors offer. "There are obviously multiple narratives you could tell about Google's motivations," Frank said. "Is Google . . . the right entity to be policing ad blocking? I think you could certainly say there is a conflict in that." Google is expected to command nearly 41 percent of the $83 billion Internet advertising market in the United States this year, according to estimates by the research firm eMarketer. Facebook, another top player, will claim just under half of that, about 20 percent. And, Google dominates Web browsing, too. According to StatCounter, the Chrome browser has accounted for more than 50 percent of the global market every month this year. News of Google's plan to create a new ad filter first surfaced in the Wall Street Journal earlier this spring. At the time, Jonathan Mendez, the chief executive of ad-tech firm Yieldbot, said he believes that Google's long-term strategy is to squeeze more dollars into its search- and text-based advertising business. "I understand they want to be a good citizen on the Web. But at the end of the day, they're a public company," Mendez told Digiday in April. "If they're reducing the types of ads that can be shown, the type they want to block is the stuff they don't do anyway." When asked to comment on its new ad filter, Google referred to its blog announcement. Google's move could also put a squeeze on smaller publishers and ad companies with fewer resources. While Google's ad filtering standards are being sold as a way to improve the ad experience for all parties involved, having to reformulate ad products to meet the ad filter's standards may be a financial burden to some businesses, said eMarketer analyst Nicole Perrin. "Smaller publishers may have a harder time with the transition," she said, but for the ad industry overall, Google's plan will likely be welcomed. google ————— Keywords: Google, ad blocker, Facebook, advertising   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES 39 years later, priesthood ban is history, but racism within Mormon ranks isn't, black members say | Shooter in public Sandy killing had 'relationship' with slain mother, police say UPDATE: Rob Miller, Utah Dem accused of harassment, drops out of race to lead party Polygamist candidate for Herriman mayor lays out platform of religious liberty, inclusion Police: Hit-run suspect ran over man who confronted him about dog abuse ELEVATE Five pitfalls to avoid when buying a condo or townhouse   Utah Arts Festival: Four days of music, culture...and art!   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS VIEW/POST COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Traffic Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

David Dayen David Dayen 2017-06-05T19:28:50+00:00 Photo: Lluis Gene/AFP/Getty Images Google, a data mining and extraction company that sells personal information to advertisers, has hit upon a neat idea to consolidate its already-dominant business: block competitors from appearing on its platforms. The company announced that it would establish an ad blocker for the Chrome web browser, which has become the most popular in America, employed by nearly half of the nation’s web users. The ad blocker — which Google is calling a “filter” — would roll out next year, and would be the default setting for Chrome when fully functional. In other words, the normal user sparking up their Chrome browser simply wouldn’t see the ads blocked by the system. What ads would get blocked? The ones not sold by Google, for the most part. The Chrome ad blocker would stop ads that provide a “frustrating experience,” according to Google’s blog post announcing the change. The ads blocked would match the standards produced by the Coalition for Better Ads, an ostensibly third-party group. For sure, the ads that would get blocked are intrusive: auto-players with sound, countdown ads that make you wait 10 seconds to get to the site, large “sticky” ads that remain constant even when you scroll down the page. But who’s part of the Coalition for Better Ads? Google, for one, as well as Facebook. Those two companies accounted for 99 percent of all digital ad revenue growth in the United States last year, and 77 percent of gross ad spending. As Mark Patterson of Fordham University explained, the Coalition for Better Ads is “a cartel orchestrated by Google.” So this is a way for Google to crush its few remaining competitors by pre-installing an ad zapper that it controls to the most common web browser. That’s a great way for a monopoly to remain a monopoly. There’s more to the story, however. The real goal for Google appears to be not just blocking ads sold by other digital suppliers besides Google, but to undermine third-party ad blockers, which stop Google ads along with everyone else’s. According to the Financial Times, Google will allow publishers what it’s calling “Funding Choices.” The publisher could charge the consumer a set price per page view to use third-party sites that block all advertising. Google would do the tracking of how many pages users view, and then charge them. Users could then “white list” particular sites, allowing ads to be shown on them and removing the charge. If users decided to pay to block ads, Google would receive a portion of that payment, sharing it with the publisher. Web users will quickly recognize their only options: pay to use the internet, or uninstall the ad blockers and surf the web for free. At least 11 percent of all web users, and perhaps as many as 26 percent of all desktop users, have third-party ad blockers on their devices, a number that will likely grow in the next few years. But it’s easy to see how Google’s policy would depress ad blocker usage — except for the case of Google’s ad blocker, which creates preferences for Google’s own ads. Google has already been found to have paid off ad blockers to keep its own ads intact. But this new policy creates an internet landscape where Google ensures viewing of its own ads, to the relative disadvantage of competitors. Senior Vice President of Google Sridhar Ramaswamy describes the concept as a way to support internet websites and users alike, by making online ads less annoying and helping to “maintain a sustainable web for everyone.” It’s hard to build a coalition in favor of annoying ads. And publishers would be guaranteed a revenue stream, either through charging consumers for an ad-free experience, or from the ads themselves. So the policy aligns the interests of virtually everyone on the web content side. Improving Google’s bottom line and crushing anyone who tries to compete is just a nice side benefit. With the Federal Trade Commission still at just two members for the foreseeable future, and the acting chairman favoring a laissez-faire approach to internet oligopolies, it’s unlikely any action will be taken in the near term to stop Google from operating as what former FTC official Jonathan Kanter calls “prosecutor, judge, and jury for ad quality.” Other experts believe that the Department of Justice might take the lead in antitrust enforcement against Google, especially in light of such a forcing event. That’s especially true if the department’s antitrust division sees the Coalition for Better Ads as a cartel, which the FTC does not typically enforce. In a New York Times op-ed in April, author Jonathan Taplin laid out the path forward for regulators: It’s time to break up the Alphabet.

FILE - In this Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2011 file photo, a person stands near the Apple logo at the company's store in Grand Central Terminal, in New York. Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into peopleâ€šÃ„Ã´s homes. Tapping Appleâ€šÃ„Ã´s Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Appleâ€šÃ„Ã´s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015, Sunday, June 4, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) SAN JOSE, Calif. – The Latest on Apple’s annual conference in California (all times local): 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn’t. Yet it isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera – the same one found in the iPhone 7 – along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It’s expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It’ll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple didn’t discuss the privacy implications, though typically, the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. That’s a contrast to Google’s approach. Apple’s approach protects privacy, but might make the service less useful when switching devices. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple’s mobile software. ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple’s is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple’s Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centred on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn’t immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favour of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It’s turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That’s a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it’s expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it’s a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple’s is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more “smarts” using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from “Toy Story,” joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple’s streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon’s Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple’s annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It’s the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn’t be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple’s large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple’s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn’t become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches – but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 per cent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 per cent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it’s still at fourth overall, at less than 5 per cent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple’s annual developers conference is the company’s chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple’s app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Sanpchat, don’t cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included “Minecraft: Pocket” and a new version of “Goat Simulator,” an oddball game that’s exactly what its name sounds like. Apple’s also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people’s homes. Tapping Apple’s Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple’s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple’s annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn’t had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people’s lives. 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Using Mindfulness to Create a Safe and Healthy Workplace SOURCE: National Association for Environmental Management (NAEM) DESCRIPTION: This article originally appeared on NAEM’s Green Tie blog.  By Kate Kerr If you’d walked into a corporation ten years ago to discuss the benefits of mindfulness and meditation for organizational effectiveness, leadership and bottom line results, security might have discreetly ushered you out of the building.  During my own 20-year corporate career, I certainly couldn’t have imagined taking a float plane to a hunting lodge in Northern Quebec to lead a mindfulness retreat for some of North America’s top Founders and CEOs. But this is the type of work we are constantly engaged in and hired to do now. Indeed, well-known organizations, such as General Mills, Aetna, Intel and Google, have long recognized the benefits of mindfulness meditation. Many have their own in-house meditation programs, and conduct in-house research to demonstrate it’s effectiveness. Google trains 2000 engineers each year in mindfulness and meditation, one of their most popular programs, ‚Search Inside Yourself’ has a wait list stretching 6 months. Intel started their ‚Awake@Intel’ mindfulness program in 2012 and at least 2000 employees have gone through training. Why are these household names investing in these types of programs?  In today’s 24/7 always-on work environment, many business leaders are dealing with increased levels of executive function burnout, leading to poor resiliency to work-related stress and shrinking attention spans. Among employees, workplace stress creates high turnover and retention issues. Mindfulness is a potential antidote.  While mindfulness has been around for thousands of years, its emergence as a practice in the West dates back to the 1979, when Jon Kabat-Zinn combined Buddhist teachings with scientific findings for the purposes of treating stress. His work at the helm of the Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School has helped demonstrate that what some might have once considered mystical „woo woo” is, in fact, a medically effective technique for managing stress, pain and illness.    At its core, mindfulness is a discipline that helps us retrain our attention and boost concentration power. This helps us focus on tasks requiring sustained attention and in stressful tasks performed under time constraints. The obvious benefit is increased productivity but this is only scratching the surface. Why mindfulness is relevant to EHS&S Where it gets interesting for EHS&S is the way it teaches us to control our attention, which increases focus and reduces mistakes caused by distraction. A 2010 study by the University of California Irvine, for example, revealed that a whopping 73 percent of trips and falls are caused by inattentiveness and distraction. It’s easy to see, therefore, how evidenced-based mindfulness training may be a highly-effective solution for high-risk work environments, as well as for helping EHS&S leaders remain focused. So what does a mindfulness practice look like?  The first thing you should know about mindfulness is that you don’t need a yoga mat, a candle or a darkened room to create a practice. Mindfulness can be done anytime and anyplace, and for any length of time. The beauty is that it’s highly adaptable to workplace environments and can be implemented in short bursts throughout your day. It’s not about to-dos. Next, it’s helpful to notice any resistance you might be feeling about it. It’s normal to feel that practicing mindfulness sounds adding yet another thing to your to-do list, but it’s not actually a task to be accomplished. You can practice mindfulness while you’re walking to a meeting, sitting down to do some work at your desk or listening to a colleague. What better time to take a conscious breath than during an intense discussion? It’s an invitation to let go of goals and achieve more. One of the paradoxes of mindfulness is that taking a few minutes or more to „pay attention on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally” as Kabat-Zinn puts it, may create a sense of spaciousness in our day, which can actually help us get more done on our to-do list. Another paradox? Mindfulness is an invitation to let go of any goals and lean into our moment-to-moment experiences. Over time our busy minds begin to settle, enabling us to be more present and see more clearly. So ultimately we’re more likely to achieve our goals. So why not take a moment right now to check in on yourself, listen to your thoughts, notice how you’re feeling and just breathe?

By Zack Whittaker for Zero Day | June 5, 2017 -- 19:24 GMT (12:24 PDT) | Topic: Apple (Image: Apple) Apple has revealed its latest invention, the HomePod. It's a new Siri-powered smart assistant that Apple says will "reinvent home music." The smart assistant was revealed Monday at the company's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in San Jose, Calif., in an effort to lure in developers to work on the next-generation platform. Apple's marketing chief, Phil Schiller, said on stage during the keynote that the speaker is powered by Siri intelligence, which he said had seen significant improvements and enhancements since its debut. It can interact with your messages, relay sports scores, the news, general knowledge, provide translations, and control your home. The speaker comes with a seven-array, beam-forming tweeter, with directional control, and a bass woofer -- and it's powered by an A8 chip, which Schiller said may be the "biggest brain in a speaker." "It sounds incredible," said Schiller, during the keynote. It also uses spacial awareness to adapt and ensure a better sound, depending on its environment, and it works closely with Apple Music. Siri will now share its learned and personalized data across devices with end-to-end encryption -- so that Apple doesn't know your preferences. Siri, the company's almost-forgotten, voice-activated assistant, has long been outdone and eclipsed by Amazon and Google's hardware assistants. Apple's betting on its artificial intelligence effort, with a helping hand from developers, to help Siri one-up and leapfrog its competitors. The timing isn't all that surprising. The smart assistant market is anything but crowded, but it already has two well-established players in the space. Both Amazon's Echo and Google's Home have taken the markets by storm, but they have long been dogged with privacy concerns about who has access to users' spoken data and search queries. Amazon and Google are invested in selling your data for more targeted advertising, which subsidizes the lower price of its devices. Apple, on the other hand, is focused on selling hardware and apps. That's held the company in good stead in recent years. Locking itself out of the data loop means it can't turn over much of your data to the government. Compare that to Amazon, which has -- to date -- refused to turn over any figures on government requests the retail giant may have received. Some already think Google's plan for its cloud-based artificial intelligence assistant is a "privacy nightmare," because its users are effectively giving up their data so Google can sell it and monetize it. Apple's logic is that, for the most part, it doesn't want your data. Federighi reiterated that many of the advanced deep learning and artificial intelligence analysis -- such as finding your location, facial recognition in photos, and setting calendar reminders -- is done on the device, shutting Apple out of the loop -- preventing anyone from asking Apple for data it doesn't have. But for a company that doesn't want your data -- to make Siri better, it has increasingly been asking for it. Apple contends that it still doesn't want to see your information. Starting in iOS 10, released last year, the software built in a safeguarding engine, dubbed "differential privacy," that effectively scrubs and adds noise to user data so that the company can't tell where it's coming from but can still provide useful feedback to the user. That means Apple can analyze search queries for trends, without being able to identify any particular individual customer. In effect, it can use this mass of crowdsources data to spot trends that lets the company return common, trending queries back to users faster without compromising privacy, it says. Or, in other words, "differential privacy addresses the paradox of learning nothing about an individual while learning useful information about a population," said Aaron Roth, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on differential privacy. Apple seems to hope this approach can let it compete in an already established space with a novel twist to stand out from the crowd -- privacy -- where the alternative is open season on your private information.

Amazon may launch 'Ice' smartphones in India running Android with Google services Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 11:17am PDTJun 5, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 Amazon News Rumors Amazon famously misread the market when it launched the Fire Phone in 2014 without any Google apps. Scarcely a year later Amazon had abandoned the device in the face of minuscule sales figures. Now, it's rumored to be prepping a new smartphone, but unlike the Fire Phone, this one will apparently run a version of Android with Google services. The report claims Amazon will brand these new phones as "Ice," and they will ship with Android 7.1.1. That means they'll have Google Assistant out of the box. Alexa support isn't as clear, but I'd be shocked if Amazon didn't add that. The Ice phone will also have the Play Store and all the apps that come with it. The first of these phones might launch in India by the end of the year, perhaps as a trial before shipping the phone in other markets. This would be an inexpensive phone with modest specs including a 5.2-5.5-inch screen, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, a 13MP camera, and a Snapdragon 435. Amazon is currently planning on a price of Rs 6,000 (roughly $93), but that could change by the time it launches. Well, if it launches.

Bruce Wayne From Fire to Ice. Not so subtle. Daniel 'Cause when Amazon made their last phone, all they did was get burned. XD NexusKoolaid And what did they do with all those unsold Fire phones they had stockpiled? They put 'em on ice. Daniel And what a bummer for them; they really had a burning desire to sell a bunch of them NexusKoolaid But in the end, they just decided to chill out. Daniel Bet you don't get these kind of comments on other websites. lol 4Ui812 She's sun and rain , She's fire and ice , a little crazy but it's nice , and when she gets mad best to leave her alone Daniel "You leave my wife outta this" -Jeff Bezos talking about his phone Lord Argyris Maybe they just like Pokemon? I expect they'll chain as many types that are super effective on the next in line as possible. Expect Flying, Bug and Psychic phones in the coming years. Or Dragon, Dragon, Dragon... MJ Here we go again... At least Amazon figured out it needs to have the Play Store. Pessimippopotamus Has anyone tried to make an E-Ink phone before aside from Yota? I feel like a smartphone that lasts several days with a b&w but very efficient screen would be right up Amazon's alley, especially considering its Kindle lineup, instead of a me-too low-end device. Marty Every e-ink device I've ever used was painfully slow. Unless e-ink can refresh at LCD rates, I don't see it being used as the primary display. Pessimippopotamus This is true. I feel like there's a bigger potential market in it as opposed to something like say... ...a phone with a 4-camera 3D system. 4Ui812 Amazon is taking a page from Microsoft. But I'm telling you ... don't discount MS. That beast is slowly waking up. Marty Agreed. MS will eventually finally have the world's best smartphone...long after the industry and the market has moved onto other things. 😋 4Ui812 No. Microsoft is moving back into software. Hardware was never their forte nor their bread and butter. T4rd I actually thought the opposite; their hardware is pretty solid IMO, esp. their newer tablets and laptops. In the mobile arena, software is definitely what's holding them (and other OEMs from using their software) back. Đức Thành Yup, their hardware isn't something I'd complain about as much as I'd complain about the software. There are times I'd just like to swear at my Windows 10 PC while I'd very seldom do that if at all to my precious Chromebook. T4rd Seems like they're still on their way to sleep right now.. https://seekingalpha.com/news/3271314-microsoft-rolled-os-update-bricked-windows-phones. I'm sure MS will return at some point; if anyone has the resources to brute force the mobile market (again), it's MS. But yeah.. it's going to be a while still.

Jason King How can Amazon sell both a device with Google Services and their Fire tablets? I thought Google Services was all-in-one? MJ It's a PHONE that will have Android and Google services on it. What's the confusion? Google Services agreements are per device... Jason King In the past, members of the Open Handset Alliance were prohibited from making any non-Google approved devices (ie: forked) from a company level, not a device level. It's why Acer had to pull out of the alternate Android OS that Alibaba created called Aliyum a few years ago, but that may have changed more recently. Amazon Fire was determined to be a 'fork' of Android which leads me to believe Google wouldn't allow Google Play Services on any Amazon device. MadMartigan That requirement is placed upon members of the OHA. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to get a device GMS licensed. Therefore, Amazon can do it. Acer cannot. Jason King ahhh - that's the difference then. Thanks for the clarification. Roger Siegenthaler What's the source of that information? Because Google would probably love to know seeing as this exact problem is the basis of their massive monopoly lawsuit in the EU. MadMartigan First: The basis for the EU lawsuit is that OEMs cannot sell Google Play Store compatible devices without Chrome, Google Search, and all the other GMS core apps installed. GMS licensing requires all GMS core apps be installed. Some oems would like to ship devices with Google Play store, but without the core GMS apps. Second: My source is common knowledge and deductive reasoning. Cyanogen, Inc was not a member of the OHA. Xiaomi is not a member of the OHA. Both sell (or sold) GMS devices. Xiaomi also sells non-GMS devices. Conclusions: You can sell GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Cyanogen, Inc.). You can sell non-GMS devices and GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Xiaomi). You can not sell devices with an incompatible fork of Android while a member of the OHA (Acer). Roger Siegenthaler ok; first point is wrong. That's only part of the lawsuit. And your only example that proves you to be correct is false as Xiaomi can only sell non-GMS devices within China; famously exempt from the GMS rules for ALL OEMs. RedPandaAlex Wait... don't they need to join the open handset alliance in order to do this? And doesn't that prohibit them from putting out devices without Google (like the Kindles)? MJ You are the second person who has said this... Where is this coming from? Samsung puts out phone(s) with Tizen on it. Stephen Sharp You can't put out what Google calls an "incompatible fork". This is how they put a stop to Aliyun Labrat Furthermore, if you sell one phone with an "incompatible fork" you can't sell any phone with Google Apps, at least, AFAIK. MadMartigan ...if you are a a member of the OHA. MJ What other phone does Amazon sell? YaKillaCJ They sell tablets and I wonder if the Fire Stick lineup could also violate. Im just curious whats the rules and stipulations. MadMartigan You cannot do this if you are a member of the OHA. If you are not a member, you can have your own Android and GMS Android. The OHA is what forbids that practice. Cael Tizen isn't a fork of Android. MJ Amazon Fire OS is... Rohan Tizen is a different OS while Acer and other using Alyun OS was a fork of android. The former is OK. Otherwise, companies like Samsung, LG would've had to stoop making laptops. MJ I guess you didn't read the whole discussion as someone else had the answer which is NOT your reasoning... Acer and Alyun were part of the Open Handset Alliance while Amazon is NOT. Why are you talking about laptops? LOL MadMartigan No. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to be GMS licensed. In fact, being a member of the OHA would expressly forbid them from doing this. Remember: Acer could not put out their non-GMS device because they were a member of the OHA, which is the body that forbids that sort of thing. vn33 Are they going to write a song about Fire and Ice then?? chromaniac It's going to be hard to compete against the likes of Xiaomi and Lenovo here in India. Flipkart tried and gave up. Micromax is still trying to make a comeback. Hrishikesh Bisen No it's not. At that price point and brand name of Amazon. chromaniac lol ok? MadMartigan Hey Ryan, The OHA/GMS issue seems to be confusing a lot of folks. Any chance AP could do a write up explaining this so people more clearly understand the differences/similarities? Kendall Seabury A phone of fire and ice. Designed by George R. R. Martin. Alvin Samsung's version of the fire phone was a little too literal. Andrew Bone Now just let us cast Amazon video 😉 Đức Thành I guess that one incident with the Fire Phone was enough to make Amazon reconsider its life choices and decide that it was time to grow up. Still, that was a long break that it took. The naming scheme is not bad but still kind of funny. Paul Monroe, Jr. Now if they could just do that with the fire tablets they might actually have something going on..

Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people’s homes. Tapping Apple’s Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple’s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015, Sunday, June 4, 2017.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Public pay: Compare government and teacher salaries for St. Louis area How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches — but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into peopleâ€šÃ„Ã´s homes.

If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Appleâ€šÃ„Ã´s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015, Sunday, June 4, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) 00000 SAN JOSE, Calif. – The Latest on Apple’s annual conference in California (all times local): 11:55 Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It’s expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It’ll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple didn’t discuss the privacy implications, though typically, the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. That’s a contrast to Google’s approach. Apple’s approach protects privacy, but might make the service less useful when switching devices. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple’s mobile software. ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone – and will come with a male option for the first time. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple’s is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple’s Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centred on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn’t immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favour of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It’s turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That’s a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it’s expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it’s a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple’s is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more “smarts” using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from “Toy Story,” joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple’s streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon’s Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple’s annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It’s the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn’t be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple’s large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple’s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn’t become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches – but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 per cent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 per cent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it’s still at fourth overall, at less than 5 per cent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple’s annual developers conference is the company’s chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple’s app store launched in 2008.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) By Ethan Baron | ebaron@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: June 5, 2017 at 12:06 pm | UPDATED: June 6, 2017 at 3:09 am As the annual stockholders’ meeting for Google’s parent firm Alphabet approaches, investors including a wealth-management company are asking shareholders to demand a report on a gender-pay gap the tech giant contends does not exist. The stockholder proposal seeks approval at the meeting Wednesday for the creation of a report outlining “policies and goals to reduce the gender pay gap” at the Mountain View tech behemoth. Such a report “would include the percentage pay gap between male and female employees across race and ethnicity, including base, bonus and equity compensation, policies to address that gap, methodology used, and quantitative reduction targets,” according to the proposal, contained in a proxy statement to shareholders. While the proposal from investors Eleanor Shorter and CB Wealth Generation provides statistics about the company’s lack of gender equality in its workforce and in leadership roles, it provides no information indicating women at the company are paid less than men. The issue, however, is a hot one for Alphabet and Google, the subsidiary that makes up the vast majority of Alphabet’s business. Google has been accused by the U.S. Department of Labor of “extreme” pay discrimination against women. The department is suing Google in a San Francisco federal administrative court trying to compel it to produce employee-pay data and names and contact information for workers. A judge’s decision is expected soon. Unsurprisingly, since Google has said definitively in connection with the lawsuit that “there is no gender pay gap at Google,” the Alphabet board is recommending that shareholders vote against the measure. The board, however, stops short of denying that a gender pay gap exists in the company. “The compensation structure at Google is designed to prevent gender pay differences by setting pay targets by job,” says the board’s opposing statement. “The pay targets are set using pay data on peer companies collected from industry surveys. “Pay equity analyses are also conducted regularly to determine whether our compensation structure is working as intended.”   Tags:  Google Ethan Baron Ethan Baron is a business reporter at The Mercury News, and a native of Silicon Valley before it was Silicon Valley.

Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay.

For instance, Apple’s large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple’s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn’t become a smash hit like the iPhone. 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches — but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it’s still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. 8:20 a.m. Apple’s annual developers conference is the company’s chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple’s app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Sanpchat, don’t cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included “Minecraft: Pocket” and a new version of “Goat Simulator,” an oddball game that’s exactly what its name sounds like. Apple’s also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google Home. Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people’s homes. Tapping Apple’s Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple’s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple’s annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn’t had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people’s lives.

If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Appleâ€šÃ„Ã´s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015, Sunday, June 4, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) SAN JOSE, Calif. – The Latest on Apple’s annual conference in California (all times local): 11:55 Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It’s expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It’ll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple didn’t discuss the privacy implications, though typically, the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. That’s a contrast to Google’s approach. Apple’s approach protects privacy, but might make the service less useful when switching devices. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple’s mobile software. ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone – and will come with a male option for the first time. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple’s is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple’s Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centred on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn’t immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favour of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It’s turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That’s a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it’s expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it’s a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple’s is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more “smarts” using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from “Toy Story,” joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple’s streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon’s Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple’s annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It’s the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn’t be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Apple unveils $349 HomePod, its answer to the Amazon Echo Khari Johnson@kharijohnson June 5, 2017 12:17 PM Apple today announced plans for a smart speaker named HomePod to compete with Amazon Echo, Google Home, and other smart speakers. The device, which should be released at the end of this year, will be available in white and space grey and will retail for $349. HomePod will also be spatially aware to improve music quality. The HomePod will first be available in December to customers in the U.S., United Kingdom, and Australia. Manufacturing of smart speakers with Siri inside reportedly already started in Taiwan, Bloomberg reported last month. Standing seven inches tall, the device is lined with a mesh fabric similar to the base of the Google Home or exterior of an Amazon Tap. Six microphones are used to listen for the “Hey Siri” activation, while a seven-tweeter array gauges sound quality. HomePod will be powered with an A8 chip, the same that powered the iPhone 6. The HomePod reveal was the final announcement during the keynote address today at WWDC, the Apple annual developer conference being held June 5-9 at the San Jose Convention Center in San Jose, California. Just as Siri does on other devices, on the HomePod it can talk about topics like sports, serve up news, or control smart home devices. On HomePod, Apple VP Phil Schiller said, Siri will also be able to act as a “musicologist” able to respond or learn when a person says things like “Who’s the drummer in this?” or “I like this song.” “This is free-form. Siri doesn’t need a specific list of commands. It can interpret what you’re saying and help you discover the music you love,” Schiller said. Though intelligent assistants are now able to do a range of tasks, music is still one of the most important parts of the experience. A VoiceLabs survey of smart speaker owners found that more than 40 percent of activity with the AI-powered devices is still related to playing music or books. With the new iOS 11 due out this fall, Apple announced today, Siri will get a more expressive voice and be able to carry out actions with more apps, like OmniFocus 2 and WeChat. A Siri Watch face that learns your habits is also coming soon. Over the course of the past year — which saw booming interest in bots and artificial intelligence — Siri has largely been overshadowed by competitors like Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa, and the Google Assistant, each of which has opened up to third-party developers. In recent weeks, AI-powered assistants from Amazon and Google gained the ability launch call and messaging services or announced plans to do so, and with the launch of Lens for Google and Echo Look, both companies have taken steps to introduce computer vision. Derived from the work of voice actress Susan Bennett, the Siri intelligent assistant first made its debut in 2011. While Siri is one of the first modern voice assistants, Apple is one of the last of the tech giants to release a smart speaker, following Amazon Echo in 2015 and Google Home last year. Apple certainly has some catching up to do: An eMarketer forecast last month predicted that Amazon is expected to command roughly 70 percent of the smart speaker market share this year, with Google Home taking much of the rest of the market. As VentureBeat’s Chris O’ Brien recently pointed out, Apple has a steep hill to climb, but it’s been done before. The iPod, iPhone, and iPad weren’t the first devices of their kind to be released. They were just the best overall. Siri’s name recognition could play a role in HomePod adoption. A USA Today poll published today found that 80 percent of consumers are familiar with Siri, compared to 67 percent for Alexa and 55 percent for Google Assistant. The poll also found that Siri is already used more often than intelligent assistants like Cortana, Alexa, and Google Assistant. Siri is now available on 375 million devices, Apple VP Craig Federigh said onstage today. Above: A visualization of HomePod spatial awareness, from the WWDC 2017 keynote address. Siri has been able to add events to calendar or answer random questions for a long time, but at WWDC last year, Apple announced plans to open Siri up to interact with apps, a feature that first became available in September with the launch of iOS 10. Since then, Siri has been able to do things like send WhatsApp messages and search for LinkedIn Learning courses with voice alone. iMessage apps and the iMessage App Store also debuted with iOS 10. Siri’s limited approach to app integrations runs counter to those taken by Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, who have invited developers to create their own third-party voice apps. While other tech giants have opened their products to a range of third-party voice apps and new features, Apple initially chose to limit Siri’s functionality when working with third-party software. Today, there are more than 13,000 Alexa skills and hundreds of Google Assistant actions, but only a handful of apps that have integrated with Siri.

View photos Google is going green for World Environment Day.More Image: google In the doodle, Google's logo grows green and sprouts leaves as a way to highlight World Environment Day, an annual celebration hosted by the United Nations. The day, celebrated on June 5 every year, is designed to promote awareness and action for environmental protection, according to the UN's website. Each year, a theme is chosen based on pressing environmental issues. A host country is also chosen for official celebrations.  This year's theme is connecting people to nature.  SEE ALSO: U.S. mayors and governors defy Trump, will stick to Paris agreement anyway 2017's World Environment Day comes at a pretty interesting time — less than one week after  President Donald Trump announced that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, an international treaty designed to address climate change. It was a move met with harsh criticism across the globe, particularly from the the U.S.'s northern neighbor — and coincidentally this year's World Environment Day host — Canada.  For today's celebration, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau penned a letter online explaining his country's commitment to the environment, in which he stated that "climate change is real," and said he's proud of the work Canada has done, along with other governments around the world.  "It was an honour to join with leaders from 194 other parties last year to finalize the historic Paris Agreement, which outlines ambitious actions to combat climate change, adapt to its effects, and collectively build a sustainable world," he wrote. "Canada is committed to working with the global community to protect the environment we all share." Trudeau was one of many world leaders to express disappointment with Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement last week.  We are deeply disappointed that the United States federal government has decided to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) June 1, 2017 "While the U.S. decision is disheartening, we remain inspired by the growing momentum around the world to combat climate change and transition to clean growth economies," he said in a statement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron were among those who also criticized Trump's move. Along with Nicaragua and Syria, the U.S. is the only other nation abstaining from the agreement, setting back the U.S.'s efforts to fight climate change and protect the environment in general, experts say.

Google logo goes green to promote the company’s first official environmental report Today's animated Google logo leads to 72-page report outlining Google's commitment to environmental sustainability. Amy Gesenhues on June 5, 2017 at 10:03 am More Google’s logo is going green today with an animated image that links to the company’s first published environmental report. The image appears to be Google’s regular multicolored logo, but then transitions into an all-green logo with the “l” taking the form of a tree limb. Unlike most doodles, the image doesn’t link to a search results page, but instead leads to Google’s Environment website, where you can download its 72-page environment report. “While we’ve reported our carbon footprint and published information on our sustainability programs for many years in white papers, blog posts, and on our website, we haven’t put it all together until now,” writes Google’s senior VP of technical infrastructure, Urs Hölzle, on the Google Environment website. “This report is a chance for us to reflect on what we’ve achieved so far, the lessons we’ve learned along the way, and the opportunities and challenges we see ahead. We hope you’re as excited as we are to see all our work in one place.” According to Hölzle, Google is more committed than ever to the environment and believes that “… businesses, governments and citizens all have critical roles to play to ensure that we all have clean air, water, and soil, as well as healthy forests.” Google’s environmental report lists the steps it has taken to develop an environmentally sustainable business — from designing efficient data centers to advancing its renewable energy efforts and creating sustainable work environments.

Focus on these 5 areas to deliver big results in e-commerce SEO Need to improve SEO for your large-scale e-commerce site and don't have the bandwidth to optimize content on a page-by-page basis? Check out these tips from columnist Brian Patterson. Brian Patterson on June 5, 2017 at 9:48 am More When it comes to e-commerce SEO at scale, many of the traditional tactics used for on-site optimization simply aren’t feasible. How are you going to write individually optimized titles/meta descriptions for hundreds of thousands of products? How are you going to perform keyword research for the millions of different keyword combinations your products might rank for? Because of the large scale of many e-commerce sites, traditional SEO tactics may simply be too time-intensive or tedious to make a top priority. On top of the time commitment that would be required for traditional SEO, e-commerce sites tend to present a unique set of SEO hurdles that need to be addressed. Take crawl budget, for example. For an average website — anything under a few thousand URLs — crawl budget isn’t an issue, as these sites will generally be crawled efficiently. However, we’ve worked with e-commerce sites that have millions of URLs. For sites that large, crawl budget becomes a crucial part of SEO. Having perfectly optimized pages is much less important than making sure all of your products are being crawled and indexed by the search engines. From our work with e-commerce clients, we’ve identified five areas for e-commerce SEO that can lead to strong organic traffic and revenue growth: Site indexation Main menu navigation On-page copy for category pages Product schema URL structure Let’s dig into each of these now. 1. Site indexation As mentioned above, crawl budget is a crucial consideration for large e-commerce sites. All of the on-site optimization in the world won’t help your site if Googlebot and other crawlers aren’t finding your content in the first place. There are a few tactics you can employ to improve your site indexation. One is to review the number of 5xx server errors your site returns in Google Search Console. Google Webmaster Trends Analyst Gary Illyes recently wrote a blog post on crawl budget in which he specifically directs webmasters to pay attention to the number of server errors in the Crawl Errors report in Search Console. This is because a large number of server errors or connection timeouts generally indicates poor site health. Assuming your site has few to no server errors, the next item you’ll want to review is your sitemaps. When working with one client, we successfully got Google to crawl more of the site, only to discover that the crawl also increased the number of 404 pages from 10,000 to almost 140,000. It turned out that a lot of discontinued products were still being included in sitemaps on the site, even though the pages were removed, which meant that Google was continuing to waste valuable crawl budget on products that were no longer in stock. Ensure that your sitemaps are dynamically updated to reflect the arrival of new products and the discontinuation of old products. Finally, review your product parameters. Almost every e-commerce site will have product parameters that allow site visitors to narrow, sort or otherwise refine their product searches. Here’s a sample URL for an Amazon product: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JX7OPI/ref=s9_acsd_ps_hd_bw_b12OYj_c_x_2_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-3&pf_rd_r=9X15NCBY1DGQD8JT4AEM&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=3a5dd557-ba6c-504c-b670-c4055647d760&pf_rd_i=15347401&th=1 Everything in bold after the “?” is just a parameter that Amazon uses to help users find that specific roll of paper towels. Luckily, Google Search Console (and Bing Webmaster Tools) gives you the ability to instruct Googlebot to not crawl specific parameters. If you have duplicate category pages that are distinguished only by certain sorting options, URL Parameters in Search Console is a great way to conserve crawl budget for the rest of your site. 2. Main menu navigation Though main menu navigation is important for internal linking and SEO in general, it takes on a renewed level of urgency for e-commerce sites. The pages identified in your menu are the ones most likely to be indexed and ranking in search results, especially since that menu will appear across hundreds of thousands of pages. The value of internal linking in main menu navigation is amplified for e-commerce sites. One way to capitalize on this menu navigation opportunity is to use secondary navigation options. Home Depot is a prime example of this. Their “All Departments” menu only includes their 17 most general product categories. However, when you hover over each category, it expands to secondary options within that category (and even tertiary options beyond that). With that menu appearing across every product and category page on the site, that internal linking value provides a noticeable ranking boost for Home Depot’s menu pages. 3. On-page copy for category pages Many webmasters think it’s okay to have product category pages that merely list the available products and are otherwise devoid of page content. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it’s not. Just listing products on a product category page provides almost no indication of what that page should rank for in Google. Crawlers like to see textual HTML content on a page to help understand what search results the page should appear in. Let’s look at an example from a big e-commerce player, lest you think this is an unusual strategy. Walmart has skillfully applied this approach across their product category pages, as you can see on their “Food” department page: Even something as simple as a two-paragraph description of the category provides crawlers with indexable content that gives you a much better chance of ranking in search results. It doesn’t matter if the content is at the top of the page or the bottom, as long as it’s visible to users and to crawlers. We like this strategy because, for most sites, it falls into the realm of possibility. While writing 150K unique product descriptions would be a monumental task, writing content for the hundreds of categories that these products fall into can be done with some planning and hard work. 4. Product schema While there are many helpful uses for Schema.org structured data, quite possibly the most helpful SEO use of structured data is for Product schema. Google puts a lot of emphasis on product schema, especially for e-commerce sites. Earlier this year, Google announced that they’re going to start displaying “similar items” in Google Image Search to help people find related products to what they’re searching for. Their advice to optimize for this announcement? Make sure you have product schema with an image reference. In addition to appearing in similar items searches, proper use of Product schema can make your products stand out in search results. Google will display a variety of structured data elements from Product schema, including price, star ratings, availability and more. You can see in the example below how Wayfair uses this markup effectively to increase their product visibility in search results. If possible, dynamically update your Star Rating field when customers leave new reviews on your products, as this adds more credibility to your schema and makes it likelier for Google to display your ratings. 5. URL structure When it comes to URL structure, the best solution is to keep your products as close to the root folder as possible. Although it may feel more logical to have your products several directories deep (like www.example.com/products/stuff/things/thing-1), you’re not going to want to adopt that system. Longer URLs mean that searchers don’t see your actual product name until the end of the URL, which can sometimes be abbreviated or clipped in search results. If you look at almost all major online retailers, you’ll see that their actual product listing pages are rarely more than one to two folders away from the root directory. It’s okay to include longer parameter strings after the product folder, but make sure that product name is visible in the URL for search results. If you want to take this a step further, add BreadcrumbList schema to your site to delineate the directory structure of the site. This takes the URLs that appear in SERP snippets and changes them into a clean, arrow-directed form that is much more intuitive to users. See in the example below how Dick’s and Lids’ breadcrumb URL structure makes their results so much neater and more eye-catching to users than the result for Nike. Regardless of whether or not you choose to implement this BreadcrumbList schema, make sure that the URLs for your products and your product categories are neat, readable and as close to the root directory as possible. Final thoughts By employing these five tactics, we’ve seen some noticeable SEO progress for our e-commerce clients. Here’s one client we’ve been working with since October 2016. Over the course of our engagement with this client, organic traffic is up 22 percent year over year, and organic revenue is up 27 percent as well: E-commerce SEO can have strong effects on your or your client’s online revenue, and the five tactics outlined above are the best way to get a jump start on that SEO progress.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Public pay: Compare government and teacher salaries for St. Louis area How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches — but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Weekend poll: How many photos are synced to your Google Photos account? David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/06/04 3:44pm PDTJun 4, 2017 120 Plus 1 on G+ 202 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares366 Applications Polls The Google account dashboard is a pretty cool way to see what's going on with your Google account, and the last time we ran a poll utilizing stats from it, we asked you how many apps Google thought you'd installed to your various devices. This week, we're doing Google Photos. To see how many Photos are synced to your Google Photos account, just head to https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard and scroll down until your see the entry for Photos, as shown below. So, how many photos are synced to your account? I'm at a little over 8,000 at this time, and that honestly doesn't seem like a lot to me (my Lightroom catalog contains over twice as many). I'll be curious to see how many of your break into the five-figure ranges. How many photos are on your Google Photos account? Under 100 100-999 1,000-2,499 2,500-4,999 5,000-9,999 10,000-19,999 20,000-39,999 More than 40,000. View Results  Loading ... Tags google+ photos photos sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Boolean Corporation the trick is to plug your iPhotos Library to the desktop uploader and see the magic happen. I have my Canon and SONY photos up there as well. ZettabyteGamer 6,002 photos Jes Marwaha 3.5k, since like 2014ish rndusrnm479461 Surprised that mine rose to 23k. Used to be 15k not long ago. Liam Clifford 17,017 Iwanova > 7k photos backup from blackberry until now yippiedad 78,693 Danyel Gustavo Just copy/paste of the question I made to another user: does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Barron Roth Yes, I've got 500k in Google Photos and it can be unbearably slow. makapav 55K and no it's not slow for me on my Pixel XL or Chrome on Windows. Danyel Gustavo I currently have 5k photos from my phone uploaded. I was thinking about uploading all my 15k photos taken with my camera. Alvar Lagerlof That will be no problem Michael Zinfandel Rork Not in the slightest. Hardly any of those are on my phone, and when on the web it's purely cloud based so it only loads what you are looking at. There is absolutely no lag from having more images in Google Photos. Level380 at 55k its not slow at all, searching is still fast. yippiedad Nope, I haven't noticed any lag. Victoria I have 15500 photos backed up and it's not slow in the least, still blazing fast. icethegreat 40k woohoo vmxr lower than 10 lol Liam Spradlin 55,207 photos 👀 vmxr are you trying to map the world 👀 Calvin Mccoy I get the job done from comfort of my home, with the help of hassle-free gigs that only takes from you a Desktop computer system in addition to web connection and I am also pleased than before... After half a year with this career and therefore i obtained cash in sum Thirty six Thousand us dollars... Ordinarily I make up approximate to eighty bucks/h and work for three to four hours every single day.And excellent point about this task is the fact that you can supervise time and effort whenever you work and for just how long as you may like and you attain a paycheck weekly........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Boolean Corporation 57,382... noob. :P Boolean Corporation The creepy thing is that it has recognized photo locations without having GPS data in my camera photos. Robert Porter If you have Google maps tracking your location it can go off of that too vidvox That was the craziest thing about using my DSLR on a trip through Texas last year, looking at the photos online and seeing the correct GPS location on them! Tyler Humphreys My mom had some pictures of Siberia, California and Google Photos thought they were from Russia, just from an album named "Siberia". chacalau 62,000 ish keltypack I have over 66,800 photos on Google Rob 54,857..... Both of you beat me! :P Đức Thành I feel small on here with just under 48.600 photos. But to be fair, my Nexus 5's relatively mediocre camera does diminish the frequency of my photo-taking whims a bit. I feel like this would be a different story if I had something like the Pixel or Nexus 6P, or even the Nexus 5X instead. LightofHonor Beat me. 50,866 smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245 Jerry Suppan Wow!　And I thought I had too many at 51,000+. Well, I guess we can store our entire life from birth if if we include pre-digital era scanned photos. (^J^) Đức Thành That is a creepy thought but somehow I find it kind of exciting as well. Imagine storing all of our memories, thoughts and emotions on the cloud. Victor A backup of met-art archives? 😁 Danyel Gustavo Does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Liam Spradlin Doesn't seem to make the app lag. Of course if I scroll back a really long way it'll take a sec for the photos to all load in, but otherwise things seem fine. Teja How to check the exact count? Luqmaan Mathee "To see how many Photos are synced to your Google Photos account, just head to https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard and scroll down until your see the entry for Photos, as shown below." It's in the article. Teja Oops, missed that. Its 51,929 photos. :D Carl Draper Photos does not appear for me on that page Margaritas Ante Porcos omg! are breaking films into frames and then upload? lol Kenni Odelheim I said 20-40 as a guess, but it was 46k I found out afterwards... jesus man.. I snap alot :D sssgadget ~15000 Booyabobby 3075 Paul_Werner 26,263 photos currently dcdttu 47,793. I used the photos uploader on my desktop. Lexxior what happens if you do? dcdttu It uploads pictures. Jorim Tielemans 78,533 photo's, that's only 3 times the amount of my bookmarks 🤐 maybe that would be a cool poll for next weekend. Lexxior wtf 20000+ bookmarks?! Wis Zero. makapav My condolences. matteventu 1543. I'm not a big shooter. But I don't understand how they count "Albums"... I'm sure I don't have 464 albums lol (just 4-5 actually). Antoine Martin Every link you share creates a hidden album nagi 71,234... yes, I shoot a lot. Nathaniel V Stupid question. Why is the album count so high? I think I've only got about 40 albums. Ruddock's looks the same... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b938bcf21775e44a09d96b5f066996b5222174f26d73027381a6cbf127a6ce8.png Sean It probably includes the auto-generated "this day x years ago" albums and such Lars Jeppesen Also I think it includes "shared" stuff makapav All those Hangouts albums from Picasaweb in the background that are probably hidden in Google Photos. Morten Ulv Yep, this is the correct answer. You could see them in Picasaweb. One for each day. Tomáš Petrík I have almost that many albums with less than half the photos. Bryan Mine says 577 albums, but if i click the arrow to expand it, it only shows 3 (which is correct) Hexlattice Yeah, it makes a shared album every time you share even just one photo with a person... Kinda why I prefer sharing a photo via Hangouts or some other means. I don't like the clutter it makes in my albums. senor_heisenberg Under a thousand. whispy_snippet 11,049 Dominic Labbé Well.... 99042... 😮 Got my first digital camera in December 1999. BigTurk Beat me by almost 2000! I got my first digital camera in 2002. Kudos to you haha Richard Riker 13,148 Shaunak Guharay 18,679 . I expected it to be somewhere around 5000, but holy shit JW 12k Joshua Ferguson 61K, I've slowed down over the last couple of years Simps 11,222 photo's and 959 albums that I have not created. Boolean Corporation Also, people like to share their sites with me... it appears... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fbf6c5a8bcd2762fb0751916cddfc1c30c07e67b2f9bc325f16d5e39a091d222.png Stoffers I've also had 1,648,103 shared with my 2 sites. Boolean Corporation So it must be the total amount of public Google Sites out there. Dn Bro I have 8,973,294...I'm not really sure where they are. exadeci https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3db3521ceda62f5bd4e638a39d5ae74f7f04e770dc7485d7a198f8b445df4f99.png Anand Slightly higher than your count ;). What are these sites??? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/be13189cca9396d4e74c49fdc6aecbbbd4492ec5084d30989724d23a522efbbe.png Captain_Invisible 8.973.487 here 😲 Andrew Bone Just beat you 😉 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/707765784503bfaf20d2fe1327e82cdb628e443e39d108a823b2ddff6dd7e04f.png Roderick Gadellaa 8,973,436 :P Vasilj Milošević Nearly 4M over here. WTF? Where are those sites? Anthony https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a438430be5924c8714c16e394b9f093c1241bebf635d0d22be1752a0267c8d77.png Cheesespix Not a single :) I don't save my photos online. Corey Kinard Here, have a 🍪 Phil Miller Do you hide them under your mattress? BigTurk 97,222 :O Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher I don't have Photos listed! But I estimate around 250,000-300,000 photos. Makes Photos on my phone practically unsuable, somehow Google Photos insists keeping all thumbnails in internal memory which takes up 2-3GB of space. Photos uses up all the battery of my phone if I enable the app :-( dsDoan All of my photos are synced with Google Photos, but I don't take many photos, so it's under 1,000. Jason Brian Chapa 35,445 Maxr1998 Only slightly above 2500 pictures, that's​ everything I took in the last five years. I don't take many pictures, but that's also because I'm very selective with my images - I remove most "duplicates"/alternative photos which aren't that good and only keep the best images. Bryan How does the album count work? I've only made 3 albums but it says i have 577 albums. App Shah 65K + https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4077abf057824ff03b40189ea40058cc9fdea8e6160c0bcbde23fbeaaac30a52.png Martins Nkem I've got over 2200 photos mostly photos from my picasa album and photos i uploaded to Google drive about 3 years ago. I prefer not to use cloud storage for photos any more. Richard Markert Under 100, lol. Try under 10. I don't use Photos. VAVAMk_2 Over 1700...I need to take more photos I guess. Laurentiu 27,809 SchmilK EnHaggen Just under 200,000 photos over here. Took 6 days to upload my entire photo library via desktop app. Everything I've shot with my DSLR and phones over the past 13 years. Phil Miller 42 photos a day? Do you even have time to sleep? SchmilK EnHaggen I shoot a lot of bursts, plus it's a mix of me, my wife, and my 2 kids phones all synching to the same account (granted the oldest is only 7, but she has been know to take 42 pictures of a TV show lol) Vasilj Milošević 52.832 photos 3.784 albums :D Image upload bugs for me on disqus, so here's imgur link: http://imgur.com/a/qY6gw Jeffrey Heesch Only 7,770 for the time being, but I just recently got myself a DSLR, so I'm expecting my Google storage to hurt in the near future. Mr Wright 64,616 all nudes 😎 Dmitry Stepanushkin about 30000. Nudes will stay on local storage 😁 cadtek91 I don't think the Album counts are accurate. Lord Argyris 2,925 here. Everything since I got my Nexus 7 on December 31st, 2013, which is when I officially joined the Android ecosystem. I'm curious, where is the Sites statistic some people have posted? I can't seem to find that anywhere on my account dashboard. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f18afe5301756a2f37e6f449c2faf0ec975cf47ead995985d6cf0ee4cb56fe1c.png tapsboy 10,351 JG 64,884... With another 1,940-some waiting to upload as I type (literally just got back from an extended data-light/less vacation where I was the unofficial group photographer). A lot of the pics (especially from this trip) are burst shots. Trying to photograph something as we drove by so I just let it go to get the most tree-less pic... Or to make an animation or panorama pic. That, and of course, cat pics :) Hey, if Google is going to give me free unlimited storage... Might as well take advantage. Bryan Kolb Just under 200,000... Dre 44,153 Kevin Sword "Wekeend" poll? Guess so! 9,179 photos. Phil Miller 19,268. For my 20k photo, it will be a pick of my friend Harry Johnson. Akilesh Akil https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b22006051777d76bece05eecfcae428cdcf2381379fdc6e701e6c4f64988671.jpg Barron Roth I feel like I'm an edge case, Google Photos runs very slow for me 😔 an old screenshot, I probably broke 500k these days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d2363f77f2556cf6b91ee1f158be42694f8fcb74f9869a02f388dddcdc95e383.png Rob What are all those photos? Is your porn collection included in that number? Kidding ;) Your comment about the service being slow is odd, it should only load what you're looking at and not everything. But perhaps something goes wrong when the number is so high. Barron Roth I'm a photographer, so it shouldn't be too unusual! It's slow mostly during search or scrolling through historical dates. uthark 107,383 Dlang123 Photos ‌124,910 tu3218 If I upload photos to google photos that wasn't taken on my phone, will they be analyzed and sorted correctly by their date, location ,etc. Assuming all this data is attached to the file. Robert Porter Yes, any photo on Gphotos is analyzed. If they don't have the locations, I believe Google fills that info with your Google maps location during that time. HSidhu 000064 Photos :) Victor %01000000 David Zero smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245. I have it sync with my PC, and all my DSLR pics get uploaded Justin Osborne 15k, but probably half of those just since I got the Pixel, due to our first baby. Over 20GBs of HQ pics/video since then. Michael Zinfandel Rork 70,503 Level380 55K and counting. Leandro Brandão 10132. I backed up some old photos and used the photo scan app to scan others, maybe 100 or 200 photos. I use google photos since my first android phone in 2012, i was amazed how that worked back then, now is even better. Joshua Talley Pretty sure I saw over 100k several months ago... codingismy11to7 17k, in original quality... and I've recently been thinking about uploading my 90+ GBs of stuff from before gphotos existed... Willie Chalmers III I am definitely in the minority with only 2,140 photos. What do you people take pictures of? b_boogey_xl I've got like 25k photos but if I remember correctly, this isn't just Google Photos but any photo you have uploaded to Google across their many services, including Hangouts, Google+ Messager, Google Voice, Google+, Picasa, etc… I believe if you go to your About Me page you can see all the "albums" and photos you've ever uploaded to those Google services (not including Google Photos). Mike in KC 457. Guess I'm not much of a photographer... Saqib What is maximum free storage allowed with Google photos? tehboogieman They say unlimited for compressed images Miku is Best Vocaloid 10000 and counting Joshua Worth 83,689 😊 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ef968361c0424a651500b83acdd44d4fa19466201c00685b3a584e99d0e40e77.jpg Sherrie B 297,771 Daniel Rodriguez Looks like I've taken a picture or two in my time... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/505b72e38a4d6a15ced01c270253dc58d8777887f0c273491675ea1e322be65e.png Morten Ulv Jesus. What are all those photos of? You take hundreds of photos every day? I take maybe 10 000 per year of my kids, so that's a modest average of ~30 per day. Andrew Bone ~95% selfies 😉 Daniel Rodriguez Oh god, not if I can help it. No one needs to see that much of me. abc He takes a pic of every meal he's ever eaten. Daniel Rodriguez .. guilty as charged. Daniel Rodriguez Hah, actually, I'm definitely an edge case with an unusual situation: I have a little 'lifecam' thing that takes pictures every 30 seconds that I use when traveling around, so it generates thousands and thousands of pictures when using it. The company that makes it recently went under, and so the service they offered where they hosted the pics it took went down- I downloaded my pics before it went down, and uploaded them to Google Photos, all in the Unlimited storage when letting Google compress them (which is fine, the vast majority aren't high quality anyway). So far, no issues with it, Google claims unlimited storage when you use their compression, and, numbers above showing, they mean it. create812 Google is in an intense meeting now, discussing how to handle "whales" like you. Daniel Rodriguez Hey, they promise unlimited storage if using their 'high quality' compression, I'm just taking them up on the offer! Francisco Peña they gonna throttle you from taking any more pictures. Daniel Rodriguez I'm actually curious if they will, I upload tens of thousands at a time when I travel thanks to my lifecam, and so far haven't run into any issues or gotten any alerts. I tell the client to upload them using the Google 'high quality' compression, for which they offer unlimited storage if you use it, and so far, they've been as good as their word. Definitely not doing anything that's against terms of service, all falls within the service's promised offer, so if they did throttle me, I'd love to know why. There's a big difference between 'unlimited' and 'unlimited as long as you don't go over 50,000 photos' or something like that. Artem Russakovskii Around 35k for me. Dennis 64.498 - ich speichere mittlerweile ausschließlich dort.. ast00 3342. I guess I don't take many pictures. Roderick Gadellaa Somehow Photos doesn't show up for me in that list. It's supposed to be above Play Music, right? It shows Payments there for me. Weird? vwnut13 I'd have more, but they are in a "brand account" attached to my Gmail. Still accessable online, but no longer in the Android app. Thanks for breaking, then removing that feature Google. Trent 25,525 it was very low prior to getting my Nexus 5X when that and Local Guides launched. The Pixel has raised it somewhat, but getting my DSLR and traveling fairly often (only 8 countries so far this year, but about that many again planned up until December) to take pictures and backing up my RAW files along with JPEGs has made a big difference. Peter World Citizen I love cats. I've just over 5k of photos of pussies. Plus another 2k of food and cars/bikes. Jan-Lk Else Where's the no option? Javier180 Simply dont vote. McClain S https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4911bca160a898e3d9f1f092a2af15587d485f0ca9ef12ceb21637dcd00bd2a6.png Arvid Over a 100.000 photos. I did upload everything I have, including older ones I scanned and our Family archive (going back to 1960) Wilson I'm running out of storage :O Victor 4982 albums and 246688 photos. Everything since 1996 on my Amiga till now, where every picture received or taken with the phone gets automatically baked up. Erik 41000 for now. I hope AI will improve so I can find what I'm looking for. It would be nice not to get pictures of cats when I search for dogs, buses and cameras when I search for cars and picture frames when I search for computers for example. Oh, and face recognition is still not available in Europe. I guess Google doesn't want to upset EU more than they already have. Rob I have face recognition in Europe. Not sure how I did, but it's fairly easy to activate it. I think by a single-time usage of VPN and reset app data. Have had it ever since. Alenekbell Google is paying 97$ per hour!

James 53,235 so far. I have had a hard drive failure and if it wasn't for them being backed up, theses photo s would have been lost. sasu85 Backup in Google compressed resolution or at full resolution? Do you have also other backup (like hard drive?) Or not? James It just so happens that my pics are 12mp or less and I believe that is the restriction that Google has set. Many of my pictures are scanned pictures from old photos and every smart phone I owned (I always had them backed up). I do have them on my hard drive, but have actually been rethinking this as I see no benefit from having on my hard drive. Just 440. Removed all after switching from Nexus 5 to Pixel, and will do so after switching from my Pixel to something else. mcored Photos ‌66,423 Tom Daley settings say 7700 same folder on my server says 20000+ Hmmmm not sure whats happening there Timothy Vreeland 38k, so close to moving up in the poll bracket.

I really do not take many photos, most of what I do take is used for online sales or confirmation photos, so they get deleted after the transaction. Another large number is having info from hardware at work so I can enter it into a database when I get back to my desk. Again those get deleted once that data is entered. Alfonso Surroca 8K, and that's including the fact that I synced like 15 years of photographs from my desktop computer to my Photos account. abc This is more of a "how many photos do you take" question than a Google Photo question. benmarvin 16,405. And I don't even take that many pictures. Some of my photos go all the way back to Picasa days Indefinite Implosion Yep 15,608 and a lot are from before I had a smartphone/from my DSLR when I had a smartphone. Brandon I've got just over 5k, which is less than many people here but is pretty much every photo I've taken in the last 12-ish years. I try to remember to back up to my external hard drive now and again just in case, but otherwise Google is the only thing I use for photo storage, management, or editing. James Miller My wife takes pictures of our 5 boys daily with our DSLR. Whenever I put them on our NAS drive, I have them automatically backed up using the desktop backup client. I'm up to 116,053, but that number grows by about 1000 every couple of weeks. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a6190002ab404d0e7e513fe45d2931f9173bc76ab04c9c6bfc6167f5e961b10a.jpg Deb Newman I quit using google photo because my account got hacked and googles recovery system wouldn't verify it was me even though I knew most of the answers to their questions, finally got to speak to someone from tech support and still would not verify.

Abhimanyu Seth Just 44,672 photos till now! philopek each as he likes but then i think the question is not very specific hence the answer doesn't provide much else than a sheer number. if the question had been "self made and unique images" that would have provided a more useful picture. while there certainly are photographers, selfie addicts and the likes, i know how many years it takes to produce a few 10'000 images of notworthy quality and uniqueness because i'm producing photos for the last 45 years now, all digitalized and stored safely, and at the times the pace of production was insanely high and still one gets' nowhere near some of the numbers that have bee mentioned here. further what are all the folks doing once google will drop a platform entirely. i remember that i have changed platform due to changes made by apple and/or google which is why all my images are now structred in simple folders and subfolders, storable and managable on every computer cross platform, no matter what some may decide. when apple changed from iphoto to photos for example most features were missing and to continue watching the library on apple-tv one had to purchase software without knowing whether it would meet requirements etc. i would like to know how many of those images are self-made and more or less unique, everything else is just claiming bragging rights IMO Ozl yeah, i will triple my photos and videos by the end of the year when i get the New Pixel Phone xD (hoping it still has that unlimited upload) Chris Foote 139,750.

Pro tip: Put Google Photos on your computer. If you're on vacation and you have Wi-Fi at the hotel, but Google Photos on your laptop. When you check in at the hotel, plug your phone up and copy/move all the photos over.

(I used to snap away 30+ pics a day on average, now cut it down to 5-6, keeping the phone away during events to actually enjoy the moment) Horacio Gómez 66.333 photos.

Amazon may launch 'Ice' smartphones in India running Android with Google services Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 11:17am PDTJun 5, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 Amazon News Rumors Amazon famously misread the market when it launched the Fire Phone in 2014 without any Google apps. Scarcely a year later Amazon had abandoned the device in the face of minuscule sales figures. Now, it's rumored to be prepping a new smartphone, but unlike the Fire Phone, this one will apparently run a version of Android with Google services. The report claims Amazon will brand these new phones as "Ice," and they will ship with Android 7.1.1. That means they'll have Google Assistant out of the box. Alexa support isn't as clear, but I'd be shocked if Amazon didn't add that. The Ice phone will also have the Play Store and all the apps that come with it. The first of these phones might launch in India by the end of the year, perhaps as a trial before shipping the phone in other markets. This would be an inexpensive phone with modest specs including a 5.2-5.5-inch screen, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, a 13MP camera, and a Snapdragon 435. Amazon is currently planning on a price of Rs 6,000 (roughly $93), but that could change by the time it launches. Well, if it launches.

Bruce Wayne From Fire to Ice. Not so subtle. Daniel 'Cause when Amazon made their last phone, all they did was get burned. XD NexusKoolaid And what did they do with all those unsold Fire phones they had stockpiled? They put 'em on ice. Daniel And what a bummer for them; they really had a burning desire to sell a bunch of them NexusKoolaid But in the end, they just decided to chill out. Daniel Bet you don't get these kind of comments on other websites. lol 4Ui812 She's sun and rain , She's fire and ice , a little crazy but it's nice , and when she gets mad best to leave her alone Daniel "You leave my wife outta this" -Jeff Bezos talking about his phone Lord Argyris Maybe they just like Pokemon?

MJ Here we go again... At least Amazon figured out it needs to have the Play Store. Pessimippopotamus Has anyone tried to make an E-Ink phone before aside from Yota? I feel like a smartphone that lasts several days with a b&w but very efficient screen would be right up Amazon's alley, especially considering its Kindle lineup, instead of a me-too low-end device. Marty Every e-ink device I've ever used was painfully slow. Unless e-ink can refresh at LCD rates, I don't see it being used as the primary display. Pessimippopotamus This is true. I feel like there's a bigger potential market in it as opposed to something like say... ...a phone with a 4-camera 3D system. 4Ui812 Amazon is taking a page from Microsoft. But I'm telling you ... don't discount MS. That beast is slowly waking up. Marty Agreed. MS will eventually finally have the world's best smartphone...long after the industry and the market has moved onto other things. 😋 4Ui812 No. Microsoft is moving back into software. Hardware was never their forte nor their bread and butter. T4rd I actually thought the opposite; their hardware is pretty solid IMO, esp. their newer tablets and laptops. In the mobile arena, software is definitely what's holding them (and other OEMs from using their software) back. Đức Thành Yup, their hardware isn't something I'd complain about as much as I'd complain about the software. There are times I'd just like to swear at my Windows 10 PC while I'd very seldom do that if at all to my precious Chromebook. T4rd Seems like they're still on their way to sleep right now.. https://seekingalpha.com/news/3271314-microsoft-rolled-os-update-bricked-windows-phones. I'm sure MS will return at some point; if anyone has the resources to brute force the mobile market (again), it's MS. But yeah.. it's going to be a while still.

Jason King How can Amazon sell both a device with Google Services and their Fire tablets? I thought Google Services was all-in-one? MJ It's a PHONE that will have Android and Google services on it. What's the confusion? Google Services agreements are per device... Jason King In the past, members of the Open Handset Alliance were prohibited from making any non-Google approved devices (ie: forked) from a company level, not a device level. It's why Acer had to pull out of the alternate Android OS that Alibaba created called Aliyum a few years ago, but that may have changed more recently. Amazon Fire was determined to be a 'fork' of Android which leads me to believe Google wouldn't allow Google Play Services on any Amazon device. MadMartigan That requirement is placed upon members of the OHA. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to get a device GMS licensed. Therefore, Amazon can do it. Acer cannot. Jason King ahhh - that's the difference then. Thanks for the clarification. Roger Siegenthaler What's the source of that information? Because Google would probably love to know seeing as this exact problem is the basis of their massive monopoly lawsuit in the EU. MadMartigan First: The basis for the EU lawsuit is that OEMs cannot sell Google Play Store compatible devices without Chrome, Google Search, and all the other GMS core apps installed. GMS licensing requires all GMS core apps be installed. Some oems would like to ship devices with Google Play store, but without the core GMS apps. Second: My source is common knowledge and deductive reasoning. Cyanogen, Inc was not a member of the OHA. Xiaomi is not a member of the OHA. Both sell (or sold) GMS devices. Xiaomi also sells non-GMS devices. Conclusions: You can sell GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Cyanogen, Inc.). You can sell non-GMS devices and GMS devices without being a member of the OHA (Xiaomi). You can not sell devices with an incompatible fork of Android while a member of the OHA (Acer). Roger Siegenthaler ok; first point is wrong. That's only part of the lawsuit. And your only example that proves you to be correct is false as Xiaomi can only sell non-GMS devices within China; famously exempt from the GMS rules for ALL OEMs. RedPandaAlex Wait... don't they need to join the open handset alliance in order to do this? And doesn't that prohibit them from putting out devices without Google (like the Kindles)? MJ You are the second person who has said this... Where is this coming from? Samsung puts out phone(s) with Tizen on it. Stephen Sharp You can't put out what Google calls an "incompatible fork". This is how they put a stop to Aliyun Labrat Furthermore, if you sell one phone with an "incompatible fork" you can't sell any phone with Google Apps, at least, AFAIK. MadMartigan ...if you are a a member of the OHA. MJ What other phone does Amazon sell? YaKillaCJ They sell tablets and I wonder if the Fire Stick lineup could also violate. Im just curious whats the rules and stipulations. MadMartigan You cannot do this if you are a member of the OHA. If you are not a member, you can have your own Android and GMS Android. The OHA is what forbids that practice. Cael Tizen isn't a fork of Android. MJ Amazon Fire OS is... Rohan Tizen is a different OS while Acer and other using Alyun OS was a fork of android. The former is OK. Otherwise, companies like Samsung, LG would've had to stoop making laptops. MJ I guess you didn't read the whole discussion as someone else had the answer which is NOT your reasoning... Acer and Alyun were part of the Open Handset Alliance while Amazon is NOT. Why are you talking about laptops? LOL MadMartigan No. You do not need to be a member of the OHA to be GMS licensed. In fact, being a member of the OHA would expressly forbid them from doing this. Remember: Acer could not put out their non-GMS device because they were a member of the OHA, which is the body that forbids that sort of thing. vn33 Are they going to write a song about Fire and Ice then?? chromaniac It's going to be hard to compete against the likes of Xiaomi and Lenovo here in India. Flipkart tried and gave up. Micromax is still trying to make a comeback. Hrishikesh Bisen No it's not. At that price point and brand name of Amazon. chromaniac lol ok? MadMartigan Hey Ryan, The OHA/GMS issue seems to be confusing a lot of folks. Any chance AP could do a write up explaining this so people more clearly understand the differences/similarities? Kendall Seabury A phone of fire and ice. Designed by George R. R. Martin. Alvin Samsung's version of the fire phone was a little too literal. Andrew Bone Now just let us cast Amazon video 😉 Đức Thành I guess that one incident with the Fire Phone was enough to make Amazon reconsider its life choices and decide that it was time to grow up. Still, that was a long break that it took. The naming scheme is not bad but still kind of funny. Paul Monroe, Jr. Now if they could just do that with the fire tablets they might actually have something going on..

Name: Subject: Message: Deal: Google offers $75 off Pixel or Pixel XL when spending $750 or more with financing Dealsby John Callaham3 days ago 3 250 3 The unlocked version of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL usually doesn’t get any discounts from the company’s own online store. This week, Google started offering a limited time promotion where buyers can get a $75 credit towards one of those phones. However, there are two big caveats for this offer. See also: Best Google Pixel Accessories 2 weeks ago One of the restrictions is that the $75 credit is only if you sign up to use Google’s own financing program to purchase the Pixel or Pixel XL. In other words, if you want to buy the phone without such a monthly plan, you won’t get the credit. The other restriction is that you have to spend $750 or more to purchase a version of the Pixel or Pixel XL to be eligible to get the credit. If you want to get the bigger Pixel XL, that’s not an issue, but if you want the smaller Pixel, you will have to get the 128 GB version, plus throw in the $99 price protection plan, to get that $75 credit. This offer will be available from now until June 18. The $75 credit itself will be put in place two billing periods after this promotion ends.

FILE - In this Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2011 file photo, a person stands near the Apple logo at the company's store in Grand Central Terminal, in New York. Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected s... SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera - the same one found in the iPhone 7 - along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches - but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

How to rank for ‘position 0’ in 3 simple steps: A featured snippets primer What is a featured snippet, and how can you position your content to rank for one? Columnist Stephan Spencer explains this search feature and provides tips for optimizing your pages for it. Stephan Spencer on June 2, 2017 at 9:36 am More For many site owners, ranking in position 1 is the holy grail of SEO. However, if you are in a competitive market, achieving that coveted first position in the Google SERPs (search engine results pages) may take a lot of effort and investment. I’m not saying you shouldn’t make the investment, but don’t overlook the opportunity to rank in position 0 with a featured snippet. For one thing, getting a featured snippet may be less about the link metrics and more about the actual content on your page. So if you are outgunned in terms of backlinks, then featured snippets could be just the thing for your business. Surprisingly, it is not unheard of for URLs ranking on page 2 of the Google SERPs to get a “position 0” result with a featured snippet. Of course, most featured snippets are for URLs that are in the top 10 results. As you can imagine, if you are in position 5, getting that position 0 “answer box” result can be a big boost to that page’s visibility and organic traffic. What’s a featured snippet? At this writing, featured snippets appear in 9.1968 percent of search queries, according to RankRanger. They appear at the top of the search results page, above the normal search results (hence the reason we call these “position 0” rankings). The snippet contains the URL and page title, along with a “snippet” of the page’s content in an attempt to answer the searcher’s query. The way it works is that Google will “programmatically detect pages that answer the user’s question, and display a top result as a featured snippet in the search results.” These featured snippets are designed to draw the user’s attention, and many site owners find that their CTR (click-through rate) significantly increases for the web pages that have featured snippets in the SERPs. Featured snippet examples There are many different types of featured snippets; here are some examples of the most common types. By far the most common type of featured snippet is the paragraph type: The list type of featured snippet is often shown for “process” search queries that are looking for a series of steps to accomplish a task. Note that the example below also includes an illustrative image. For getting the table type of featured snippet, your best bet is to mark up the table on your page using the <table> tag. So, how can you snag this coveted spot in the SERPs? Read on for advice. Step 1: Understanding the opportunity for your site When it comes to featured snippets, not all markets are created equal. If you are a local business, a better use of your time would be to focus on positioning your business for the Google map results, as featured snippets are not seen in SERPs that display the local pack (according to a study done by Stat Search Analytics). On the flip side, if you are in a market where there is a need for clear answers to frequently asked questions, your industry uses terms that need explanation, and/or you have data that can be presented in tabular format, then featured snippets are likely a great opportunity for you. In the aforementioned study, Stat reviewed 92,000 search queries for featured snippets and found the types of search terms which often return featured snippets are: financial mathematical time transitional status requirements health DIY processes The types of searches which rarely return featured snippets are: local info/help factual shopping images and videos Stat did a refresh of their study six months later and found something surprising. One category of searches moved from rarely returning featured snippets to commonly returning featured snippets, and that was subjective queries (e.g., “best” or “reviews” included in the query). While it’s tempting to jump into keyword research right away to find question-oriented keywords, you should first check whether your site is ranking with featured snippets today. Keep in mind, just because you have the snippet today doesn’t mean you will next week, so you’ll definitely want to track your position 0 rankings. Additionally, matching up Google Search Console CTR data with the keywords for which you have featured snippets also helps you size the opportunity, especially if you can compare CTR data for a time frame when you had the featured snippet against a time frame when you did not. Even if your site does not have any featured snippets, a review of your competitors’ featured snippets will be instructive to give you a starting point for a list of keywords you might want to focus on. Fortunately, there are a few tools available that can help you find keywords that currently have featured snippets. SEMrush makes it easy to find your featured snippets. And this method works equally well when you are sleuthing for your competitors’ featured snippets. To get started, head over to “Positions” in “Organic Research.” You can then either filter the list of keywords under Advanced Filters by: Include > SERP Features > Featured Snippets, or you can simply select the “Featured snippet” link under the “SERP features” list on the right-hand side of the page. Another excellent tool for finding tracking featured snippets is Stat Search Analytics. You will first need to create a keyword list to upload into Stat. Once Stat has the rankings for your keywords, the Stat interface will show you which of your tracked keywords are producing featured snippet result types, which Stat flags as “answer” type results. With Stat, you can filter those keywords to focus on those you are ranking in the top 10 results for, as well as tag keywords you want to track. SearchMetrics Suite also features tracking for featured snippets. They call them “Direct Answers,” but you can see in the screen shot below where they have filtered for a set of terms that nytimes.com ranks on where there are Direct Answers present. In many cases, these direct answers are Featured Snippets, as you can see in the example, “vegan Thanksgiving recipes.” Step 2: Finding great keyword candidates for featured snippets Now that we have a baseline and a better understanding of what keywords are getting featured snippets, let’s find more opportunities. Finding great candidates for featured snippets comes down to good old-fashioned keyword research. As you do your research, here are some things to keep in mind: Higher-volume terms get snippets more often. Longer queries that are comprised of six or more words tend to show featured snippets. Since the purpose of featured snippets is to answer questions, explicit questions like “who,” “what,” “how,” “where” and “why” search queries will obviously often have featured snippets. But don’t overlook implied questions with the words like “does,” “cause” and “costs,” as well as action words like “becoming,” “doing,” “getting,” “making,” “forming” or “cooking.” Implied questions also include searches on terms. Consider a search for “email marketing,” where the searcher is looking for a definition by essentially asking the implied question, “What is email marketing?” Snippets for general questions usually trigger a paragraph type of featured snippet. ‘People also ask’ Particularly if you search on general questions, you can find additional keywords that result in featured snippets in the “People also ask” section in the SERPs. Here, a search on “email marketing” gets a featured snippet, as well as a list of related search terms in “People also ask,” including “What is an email campaign?” Clicking on “What is an email campaign?” reveals a featured snippet that answers that question. Answerthepublic.com To get a list of questions that are asked about particular topic, a very useful data mining tool is answerthepublic.com, which uses the Google Suggest API to find all the permutations of a question that people are searching on. Shown below are all the questions answerthepublic.com found for the keyword “cook vegetables.” We can then drill down into the specific questions for each question modifier. Here are the “how” questions for the keyword “cook vegetables.” The long-tail keyword, “how to cook vegetables in a slow cooker,” does indeed return a featured snippet. You can also get lists of queries formulated as questions from Moz Keyword Explorer. (Go to the Keyword Suggestions tab, and where you see the pull-down list “Display keyword suggestions that,” select the option “are questions.”) You can also get questions from Rank Ranger’s Keyword Finder by clicking “Questions” under “Quick Filters.” If you have a Stat account, you can export a list of keywords from Answer the Public and then upload them into Stat to automate the process for determining which of the questions return a featured snippet in the SERPs. Step 3: Increasing the potential for featured snippet selection Whether we are creating the page from scratch or improving the page, to increase our chances of being selected for a featured snippet, we want to take a multi-pronged approach that includes: content that clearly answers the question. clean code and tagging that Google can easily understand. positive user engagement signals. I have found that your chances of being selected for a featured snippet can improve if you follow the content organizational model that I outline below: First, repeat the question that is the query, or which is implicit in the query, clearly and prominently on your web page. Directly following the question, provide a short, direct, clear answer to the question. Then, provide more information, data, images and so on to answer the question as fully and completely as possible. One way to structure your content is to use what journalists refer to as “the inverted pyramid.” When following the inverted pyramid model, your page starts with the most important information that answers the question, then transitions to more detailed information, and finally wraps up with a broader look at the topic or perhaps a case study or an example. Image Credit: The Air Force Departmental Publishing Office (AFDPO) [Public domain], via Wikimedia CommonsHow you format your HTML can make a difference too. Here are the best practices I recommend: Make the search query, or a very close version of it, a heading on the page. This means, where possible, format that query or question as an H1, H2 and so forth. Summarize the answer to the question in a single paragraph. Format that paragraph in a paragraph HTML tag <p>. Place that paragraph directly below the heading for the question. Aim for making the answer paragraph roughly 40 to 55 words. It can also help to format your content as a list, using the <li> tags. Particularly if the query you are targeting is best answered by delineating steps in a process (e.g., “how to boil an egg”), then use <ol> tags (an ordered list). If you think that a bulleted list provides the best answer to the query, then use <ul> tags (unordered list). Heading tags for each of your steps can also work, rather than <li> tags. Google is quite adept at extracting the content it needs to build a useful featured snippet. Additionally, presenting your content in a question-and-answer format (or as a list of frequently asked questions) can also help Google select a short answer from your page as a featured snippet for a question. And finally, as we mentioned above, if you create a table in your content hoping for a table-type featured snippet, it’s best to use the HTML <table> tag instead of using CSS to lay out your table. For existing web pages, I like to take a look at a page’s user engagement metrics (bounce rate, average session duration, # of pages visited) in Google Analytics. If the metrics are substantially below the site’s average, that page isn’t satisfying the needs of our site’s visitors. Since Google is in the business of delivering the best search results to searchers, having a low-performing web page may make it difficult to obtain, and, more importantly, keep a featured snippet. Google will pick up on that poor performer not by spying on your Google Analytics, but by monitoring dwell time and CTR from the SERPs. I presume the reason you want to rank highly in the Google search results is to attract leads and sales. So, while the tagging and content structuring is helpful to getting your position 0 ranking, it is actually more important to focus on making your page the very best answer to the question.

Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into peopleâ€šÃ„Ã´s homes.

If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Appleâ€šÃ„Ã´s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015, Sunday, June 4, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) 00000 SAN JOSE, Calif. – The Latest on Apple’s annual conference in California (all times local): 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple’s Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centred on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn’t immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favour of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It’s turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That’s a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it’s expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it’s a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple’s is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more “smarts” using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from “Toy Story,” joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple’s streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon’s Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple’s annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It’s the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn’t be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple’s large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple’s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn’t become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches – but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 per cent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 per cent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it’s still at fourth overall, at less than 5 per cent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple’s annual developers conference is the company’s chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple’s app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Sanpchat, don’t cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included “Minecraft: Pocket” and a new version of “Goat Simulator,” an oddball game that’s exactly what its name sounds like. Apple’s also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people’s homes. Tapping Apple’s Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple’s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple’s annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn’t had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people’s lives. 00000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay.

Google parent Alphabet joined Amazon.com as the only company with shares valued at over $1,000.  (Marcio Jose Sanchez / The Associated Press file photo)   By Mark BergenBloomberg Mon., June 5, 2017 Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. passed $1,000 (U.S.) six days after Amazon.com Inc. crossed the same threshold, showing the sustained investor confidence that tech giants can outmatch older companies. Amazon’s rise reflected bullishness in e-commerce, coming despite bigger sales in brick-and-mortar retail. Likewise, Alphabet shareholders see that TV ad budgets will continue to gravitate online, where Google dominates. Alphabet’s transition just under two years ago to a portfolio structure has also buoyed investor confidence in the stock. Alphabet’s shares hit Alphabet’s shares hit $1,003.76 at 12:18 p.m. in New York Monday, about a 38-per-cent increase since August, 2015 when Google became Alphabet, splitting off its audacious, earlier stage ventures from the core Internet business.

Alphabet issued a rare share buyback last year. Google’s primary ads business has kept expanding too, dodging any threat from the spread of mobile devices. Ad revenue reached $21.4 billion (U.S.) in the first quarter, a 19-per-cent annual leap. And the company has shown some signs of growth in its cloud-computing business, an area of massive investment internally. Along with cloud-computing, Google has heaved considerable investment into artificial intelligence, such as voice-computing. Many investors believe that investment positions Google well to hedge against any threats to its web search business a shift in computing brings. Prospects for the one-time “moon shots” — the company’s experiments in industries like health care and transportation, now called the “Other Bets” — have looked brighter this year. Verily, Alphabet’s medical business, closed a $800 million outside investment from Singapore firm Temasek. Alphabet cut investment in its fibre broadband service, a move investors appeared to cheer for the slowdown of capital in a competitive industry. Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving car unit, is in position to lead the competitive autonomous transit market, according to a note last month from Morgan Stanley. The analysts wrote that the unit could be worth around $70 billion by 2030 — a prospective value that is not baked into Alphabet’s current share price.

Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected s... SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera - the same one found in the iPhone 7 - along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches - but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines.

Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches — but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

FILE - In this Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2011 file photo, a person stands near the Apple logo at the company's store in Grand Central Terminal, in New York. Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into peopleâ€šÃ„Ã´s homes.

If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Appleâ€šÃ„Ã´s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015, Sunday, June 4, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) SAN JOSE, Calif. – The Latest on Apple’s annual conference in California (all times local): 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone – and will come with a male option for the first time. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple’s is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple’s Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centred on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn’t immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favour of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It’s turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That’s a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it’s expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it’s a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple’s is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more “smarts” using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines.

The initiative, called “We Are Still In,” backs the global agreement seeking reduced greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change. “The Trump administration's announcement undermines a key pillar in the fight against climate change and damages the world's ability to avoid the most dangerous and costly effects of climate change,” those behind the initiative said in an announcement “Importantly, it is also out of step with what is happening in the United States.” ADVERTISEMENT They wrote that they would take action to pursue “pursue ambitious climate goals,” even without the U.S. government formally agreeing to do so. “In the U.S., it is local and state governments, along with businesses, that are primarily responsible for the dramatic decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in recent years,” they wrote. “Actions by each group will multiply and accelerate in the years ahead, no matter what policies Washington may adopt.” Michael Bloomberg’s Bloomberg Philanthropies, liberal think tank Center For American Progress and the Sierra Club are among the organizers of the coalition. State and local governments and presidents of major U.S. colleges are also taking part. Some of the firms on the list have already made commitments to reduce emissions. “We remain steadfastly committed to the sustainability, carbon and energy goals that we have set as a company and to the Paris Agreement’s ultimate success,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a release. "I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment," Apple CEO Tim Cook similarly wrote in an internal email last week, obtained by Bloomberg. "We’re going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy." Prior to Trump’s announcement last week, tech CEOs, including Cook and Tesla’s Elon Musk had lobbied the president to stay in the agreement. Other firms also jointly put in full page ads in major newspapers making their case to Trump.  Tags Donald Trump   View the discussion thread.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Who's hired? Check our People in Business Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches — but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera - the same one found in the iPhone 7 - along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches - but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Public pay: Compare government and teacher salaries for St. Louis area How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives Before the 2017 top St. Louis workplaces are named, check last year's See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches — but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people's lives. ___ Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

The broad effort, called “We Are Still In,” comes days after President Donald Trump announced his plans to withdraw from the pact, a landmark accord signed in 2015 by roughly 190 nations that seeks to reduce the world’s carbon emissions. The vast coalition will be led by Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, the sources said. A spokesperson did not immediately comment for the story, but a website for it appears to suggest that more information is coming later today. For now, though, their opening salvo is a public commitment: Tech giants, along with other business and political leaders, said they are “joining forces for the first time to declare that we will continue to support climate action to meet the Paris Agreement.” “The Trump administration’s announcement undermines a key pillar in the fight against climate change and damages the world’s ability to avoid the most dangerous and costly effects of climate change,” according to a copy of the missive shared by sources with Recode. “Importantly, it is also out of step with what is happening in the United States.” “In the U.S., it is local and state governments, along with businesses, that are primarily responsible for the dramatic decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in recent years,” the note continues. “Actions by each group will multiply and accelerate in the years ahead, no matter what policies Washington may adopt.” Announcing his intent to leave the Paris agreement during a speech in the White House’s Rose Garden last week, Trump said it “disadvantages the United States, to the exclusive benefit of other countries,” while arguing that it left “American workers, who I love, and taxpayers to absorb the costs.” Hours after Trump revealed his thinking, however, many state leaders, city mayors and U.S. businesses declared their opposition — while tech giants in Silicon Valley, which often have fought Trump, once again declared war on the White House. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the decision to withdraw as “bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk.” Top executives at Google and Twitter tweeted similarly, and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who has advised Trump on business issues, even said he would cease participating on the president’s economic councils. In a note to employees, obtained last week by Recode, Apple CEO Tim Cook also expressed his “disappointment” with Trump’s move. The iPhone giant’s chief even called the president — days before Trump announced his plans — to try to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. Some of those companies previously joined with other business leaders to run full-page advertisements in major newspapers that pleaded with Trump to remain part of the Paris pact. The deal would have expanded “markets for innovative clean technologies,” they said, which could spur economic growth and job creation. And companies expressed fear that withdrawing would “expose us to retaliatory measures” from other countries’ governments. Read the new, full letter, as obtained by Recode: We, the undersigned mayors, governors, college and university leaders, investors and businesses, are joining forces for the first time to declare that we will continue to support climate action to meet the Paris Agreement. In December 2015 in Paris, world leaders signed the first global commitment to fight climate change. The landmark agreement succeeded where past attempts failed because it allowed each country to set its own emission reduction targets and adopt its own strategies for reaching them. In addition, nations – inspired by the actions of local and regional governments, along with businesses – came to recognize that fighting climate change brings significant economic and public health benefits. The Trump administration’s announcement undermines a key pillar in the fight against climate change and damages the world’s ability to avoid the most dangerous and costly effects of climate change. Importantly, it is also out of step with what is happening in the United States. In the U.S., it is local and state governments, along with businesses, that are primarily responsible for the dramatic decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in recent years. Actions by each group will multiply and accelerate in the years ahead, no matter what policies Washington may adopt. In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities and businesses representing a sizeable percentage of the U.S. economy will pursue ambitious climate goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions. It is imperative that the world know that in the U.S., the actors that will provide the leadership necessary to meet our Paris commitment are found in city halls, state capitals, colleges and universities, investors and businesses. Together, we will remain actively engaged with the international community as part of the global effort to hold warming to well below 2°C and to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy that will benefit our security, prosperity, and health.

Most large urban areas tend to have only one air quality monitor for every 100 to 200 square miles. In comparison, the new mobile approach maps air pollution every 100 feet, or at about four to five locations along a single city block. "Air pollution varies very finely in space, and we can't capture that variation with other existing measurement techniques," said lead researcher Joshua Apte of The University of Texas at Austin in the US. "Using our approach and analysis techniques, we can now visualise air pollution with incredible detail. This kind of information could transform our understanding of the sources and impacts of air pollution," Apte added. The research was conducted in partnership with the US-based non-profit Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), Google and Aclima, a California-based provider of environmental sensors. By integrating Aclima's sensor system into Google Street View cars, the team mapped air pollution in 78 square miles of Oakland, California, over an entire year, collecting one of the largest data sets of air pollution ever measured of single city streets.  This new technique maps urban air pollution at 100,000 times greater spatial resolution than is possible with traditional government air quality monitors, according to a study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. The team believes that their hyper-local mobile measurement system could be implemented in many cities throughout the world, providing detailed air quality information for citizens, families, local governments and scientists.  The new technique could address major air quality monitoring gaps worldwide and has the potential to transform the way air pollution is monitored in urban areas as well as shed light on the health effects on city dwellers. "You could use this information when you're picking a school for your kids. Is there a school with a playground that might have better air quality because your kid has asthma," Apte said.  "This hyper-local information about consistent air quality can be really useful for people, especially those who are vulnerable because of age or health condition," Apte noted.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Phil Schiller, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, introduces the HomePod speaker at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Monday, June 5, 2017, in San Jose , Calif. (Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press) By Associated Press By Associated Press June 5 SAN JOSE, Calif. — The Latest on Apple’s annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don’t count Apple out even if it’s late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple’s smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren’t themselves firsts. The iPod wasn’t the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company’s first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it’s giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It’s no surprise, but there’s integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It’s Apple’s first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn’t. Yet it isn’t as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It’s also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It’s expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It’ll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple’s mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a “high efficiency” format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it’s not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple’s is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri’s male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple’s Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn’t immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It’s turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That’s a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it’s expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it’s a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple’s is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more “smarts” using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from “Toy Story,” joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple’s streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon’s Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple’s annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It’s the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn’t be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple’s large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple’s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn’t become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches — but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it’s still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple’s annual developers conference is the company’s chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple’s app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don’t cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included “Minecraft: Pocket” and a new version of “Goat Simulator,” an oddball game that’s exactly what its name sounds like. Apple’s also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people’s homes. Tapping Apple’s Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple’s first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple’s annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn’t had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one would further broaden the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people’s lives. ___ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on Apple's annual conference in California (all times local): 1:00 p.m. Don't count Apple out even if it's late to the game in unveiling services based on artificial intelligence, one analyst says. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber says time will tell how well Apple's smarter Siri digital assistant will compete with Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. But he says Apple has an advantage given that it makes software and gadgets designed to work well together. On Monday, Apple previewed a Siri watch face on Apple Watch to offer reminders and other tasks people might be looking for. On the phone, Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. If someone texts you about owing money, for instance, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Apple also unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker coming in December. Apple has a history of releasing influential products that weren't themselves firsts. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, yet it changed how the masses listen to music. ___ 12:35 p.m. Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years. The HomePod speaker unveiled at a conference for software programmers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year. ___ 12:20 p.m. Apple is introducing a mid-sized iPad Pro in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. Such a model had been expected in March, but Apple instead refreshed its non-Pro models. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with its Surface Pro. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. Apple also previewed software updates for the iPad at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 11:55 a.m. Apple is trying to make augmented reality a reality with new tools for iPhones and iPads. Augmented reality is the blending of the physical and virtual worlds. In one demo, Apple executive Craig Federighi pointed a camera at a table on stage and added a virtual coffee cup and a lamp on the real table. Apple is making software tools available for outside app writers to design apps with augmented reality. He says the tools will make hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads capable of the technology. Microsoft, Facebook and Google also have been dabbling with augmented reality, though the developments are still in the early stages. Apple is also offering tools for app makers to embed artificial intelligence capabilities. This will be part of the iOS 11 software update for iPhones and iPads. It's expected in September. ___ 11:40 a.m. Siri will be paying more attention to what you do on your iPhone. Apple wants its digital assistant to be more helpful in navigating your digital life. It'll learn your habits based on what articles you might be reading, for instance. Or if someone texts you about owing money, it will ask if you want to pay from your Apple Pay account. Google already tries to be proactive with its Assistant on Android phones and Google Home speaker. Apple is poised to announce its own speaker at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. Apple says the machine processing takes place on the device itself, rather than over the internet. However, that could make the service less useful when switching devices. To address that, Apple says Siri will now have some syncing in the cloud, while protecting privacy. The Siri updates are expected in September with iOS 11, the next version of Apple's mobile software. ___ This item has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to Apple not discussing privacy implications for the Siri features ___ 11:20 a.m. Siri is getting a new voice on the iPhone, Make that new voices, as the male version of Siri is getting a refresh, too. It comes as Apple is poised to unveil a Siri-powered internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. Other features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages syncing in the cloud. Only the most recent messages will be kept on the device to save storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace JPEGs. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to pay back a friend or other individual through its payment service, Apple Pay. Before, transactions had been limited to products and services from businesses and institutions. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September when Apple typically releases new iPhones. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ This item has been corrected to delete an incorrect reference to Siri's male voice coming for the first time. ___ 11:10 a.m. Virtual reality is coming to Apple's Mac computers. New iMacs are getting brighter displays and graphics capabilities. Apple says that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality experiences. Apple is late on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Apple executives demonstrated the use of Macs to produce VR experiences, though they didn't immediately talk about making a headset to view them. VR has often been described as the next big thing, though so far, the interest appears more among content developers and hardware makers than with everyday users. The new iMacs start at about $1,300. Apple also updated its MacBook laptops with faster processors. These new Macs start shipping Monday. Apple also unveiled the high-end iMac Pro for power users at its annual conference for software programmers Monday. It will come in December starting at about $5,000. The announcements follow complaints that Apple has let its Mac computers languish in favor of its better-selling products, namely the iPhone. ___ 10:50 a.m. Apple says its Safari browser will try to guard your privacy by identifying and blocking data files that track you as you move from website to website. It's turning to machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to make that happen. That's a new focus for Apple as it competes with Google and Amazon. Later Monday, it's expected to announce an internet-connected smart speaker to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Other features coming to the Mac include the ability to stop video from automatically playing on websites when using Safari. The Mac will also get improved photo management, including new editing tools and better face recognition to help you search your photo library. The next Mac version will be called High Sierra, suggesting that it's a refinement of the current version, Sierra. Apple typically makes major updates to its Mac software every other year. It is coming out this fall and will be a free update. Apple's is unveiling new features at its annual conference for software programmers on Monday. ___ 10:35 a.m. Apple is updating its smartwatch to give it more "smarts" using the Siri digital assistant. With a new watch face, Apple Watch promises to learn about your routines to figure out what information to display on the watch face. That could include a reminder to make a call or a flight reservation. This comes as Google and Amazon have made headways in assisting users based on knowledge of past routines. Another watch face will feature Woody, Jessie and Buzz from "Toy Story," joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Apple is also bringing improvements to playing music and recording fitness activities. The new features will come in a software update expected in a few months. IDC estimates that Apple shipped about 3.6 million watches during the first three months of the year. By comparison, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 9 million iPads during the same stretch. ___ 10:25 a.m. Apple says Amazon will be making an app for its video service for the Apple TV device this year, filling one of the major gaps on Apple's streaming TV device. Amazon is already available on rival devices such as Roku and, of course, Amazon's Fire TV. CEO Tim Cook kicked off Apple's annual conference for software programmers on Monday. It's the first time in 15 years that Apple has held its conference in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. The event has been in San Francisco in recent years. The event began with an Apple video portraying what life might be like without an app store. Not surprisingly, it depicts a world of chaos. __ 9:05 a.m. If Apple unveils a rival to internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google, it wouldn't be the first time that Apple hops on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple's large-size iPhones are now popular, after Apple initially resisted them despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. Apple is expected to announce plans for a speaker on Monday. It would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. The lack of a breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader among smartwatches, it hasn't become a smash hit like the iPhone. ___ 8:45 a.m. Apple Watch has emerged as the market leader for smartwatches — but it has competition after including basic fitness trackers in the count. There, Apple shares the lead with Chinese company Xiaomi, whose fitness tracking wristbands are mostly sold in China. The research firm IDC says Apple and Xiaomi each has a worldwide market share of nearly 15 percent in the first quarter. Fitbit, once the leader of wearable devices, is third at about 12 percent. Samsung doubled the number of wearable devices shipped compared with the previous year, but it's still at fourth overall, at less than 5 percent, just ahead of Garmin. Apple is expected to unveil new features for its Apple Watch as its Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. Apple's annual developers conference is the company's chance to preview upcoming features for iPhones, iPads, watches and Mac computers. The conference starts Monday in San Jose, California. The idea is to get outside software programmers geared up to write apps for Apple products. Leading up to it, Apple says those outside app developers have earned more than $70 billion since Apple's app store launched in 2008. Some of the most popular apps, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, don't cost anything. The most popular paid apps are usually games. This week, this included "Minecraft: Pocket" and a new version of "Goat Simulator," an oddball game that's exactly what its name sounds like. Apple's also expected to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker to rival Amazon's Echo and Google Home. ___ Midnight Apple appears poised to unveil a voice-activated, internet-connected speaker that would create a new digital pipeline into people's homes. Tapping Apple's Siri digital assistant, such a speaker is expected to serve as a butler as well as an outlet for listening to music. If the speculation pans out, the speaker would be Apple's first new product since its smartwatch in 2015. It would mark an effort by Apple to catch up with Amazon and Google. Apple's annual conference for app developers begins Monday in San Jose, California. Although it was first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn't had a stand-alone assistant.

Weekend poll: How many photos are synced to your Google Photos account? David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/06/04 3:44pm PDTJun 4, 2017 120 Plus 1 on G+ 202 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares366 Applications Polls The Google account dashboard is a pretty cool way to see what's going on with your Google account, and the last time we ran a poll utilizing stats from it, we asked you how many apps Google thought you'd installed to your various devices. This week, we're doing Google Photos. To see how many Photos are synced to your Google Photos account, just head to https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard and scroll down until your see the entry for Photos, as shown below. So, how many photos are synced to your account? I'm at a little over 8,000 at this time, and that honestly doesn't seem like a lot to me (my Lightroom catalog contains over twice as many). I'll be curious to see how many of your break into the five-figure ranges. How many photos are on your Google Photos account? Under 100 100-999 1,000-2,499 2,500-4,999 5,000-9,999 10,000-19,999 20,000-39,999 More than 40,000. View Results  Loading ... Tags google+ photos photos sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Boolean Corporation the trick is to plug your iPhotos Library to the desktop uploader and see the magic happen. I have my Canon and SONY photos up there as well. ZettabyteGamer 6,002 photos Jes Marwaha 3.5k, since like 2014ish rndusrnm479461 Surprised that mine rose to 23k. Used to be 15k not long ago. Liam Clifford 17,017 Iwanova > 7k photos backup from blackberry until now yippiedad 78,693 Danyel Gustavo Just copy/paste of the question I made to another user: does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Barron Roth Yes, I've got 500k in Google Photos and it can be unbearably slow. makapav 55K and no it's not slow for me on my Pixel XL or Chrome on Windows. Danyel Gustavo I currently have 5k photos from my phone uploaded. I was thinking about uploading all my 15k photos taken with my camera. Alvar Lagerlof That will be no problem Michael Zinfandel Rork Not in the slightest. Hardly any of those are on my phone, and when on the web it's purely cloud based so it only loads what you are looking at. There is absolutely no lag from having more images in Google Photos. Level380 at 55k its not slow at all, searching is still fast. yippiedad Nope, I haven't noticed any lag. Victoria I have 15500 photos backed up and it's not slow in the least, still blazing fast. icethegreat 40k woohoo vmxr lower than 10 lol Liam Spradlin 55,207 photos 👀 vmxr are you trying to map the world 👀 Calvin Mccoy I get the job done from comfort of my home, with the help of hassle-free gigs that only takes from you a Desktop computer system in addition to web connection and I am also pleased than before... After half a year with this career and therefore i obtained cash in sum Thirty six Thousand us dollars... Ordinarily I make up approximate to eighty bucks/h and work for three to four hours every single day.And excellent point about this task is the fact that you can supervise time and effort whenever you work and for just how long as you may like and you attain a paycheck weekly........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Boolean Corporation 57,382... noob. :P Boolean Corporation The creepy thing is that it has recognized photo locations without having GPS data in my camera photos. Robert Porter If you have Google maps tracking your location it can go off of that too vidvox That was the craziest thing about using my DSLR on a trip through Texas last year, looking at the photos online and seeing the correct GPS location on them! Tyler Humphreys My mom had some pictures of Siberia, California and Google Photos thought they were from Russia, just from an album named "Siberia". chacalau 62,000 ish keltypack I have over 66,800 photos on Google Rob 54,857..... Both of you beat me! :P Đức Thành I feel small on here with just under 48.600 photos. But to be fair, my Nexus 5's relatively mediocre camera does diminish the frequency of my photo-taking whims a bit. I feel like this would be a different story if I had something like the Pixel or Nexus 6P, or even the Nexus 5X instead. LightofHonor Beat me. 50,866 smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245 Jerry Suppan Wow!　And I thought I had too many at 51,000+. Well, I guess we can store our entire life from birth if if we include pre-digital era scanned photos. (^J^) Đức Thành That is a creepy thought but somehow I find it kind of exciting as well. Imagine storing all of our memories, thoughts and emotions on the cloud. Victor A backup of met-art archives? 😁 Danyel Gustavo Does having that many pics saved to your Google Photos slows down or makes the app lag in any way? I have the impression that after I backed up my photos, the app takes longer to open. Liam Spradlin Doesn't seem to make the app lag. Of course if I scroll back a really long way it'll take a sec for the photos to all load in, but otherwise things seem fine. Teja How to check the exact count? Luqmaan Mathee "To see how many Photos are synced to your Google Photos account, just head to https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard and scroll down until your see the entry for Photos, as shown below." It's in the article. Teja Oops, missed that. Its 51,929 photos. :D Carl Draper Photos does not appear for me on that page Margaritas Ante Porcos omg! are breaking films into frames and then upload? lol Kenni Odelheim I said 20-40 as a guess, but it was 46k I found out afterwards... jesus man.. I snap alot :D sssgadget ~15000 Booyabobby 3075 Paul_Werner 26,263 photos currently dcdttu 47,793. I used the photos uploader on my desktop. Lexxior what happens if you do? dcdttu It uploads pictures. Jorim Tielemans 78,533 photo's, that's only 3 times the amount of my bookmarks 🤐 maybe that would be a cool poll for next weekend. Lexxior wtf 20000+ bookmarks?! Wis Zero. makapav My condolences. matteventu 1543. I'm not a big shooter. But I don't understand how they count "Albums"... I'm sure I don't have 464 albums lol (just 4-5 actually). Antoine Martin Every link you share creates a hidden album nagi 71,234... yes, I shoot a lot. Nathaniel V Stupid question. Why is the album count so high? I think I've only got about 40 albums. Ruddock's looks the same... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b938bcf21775e44a09d96b5f066996b5222174f26d73027381a6cbf127a6ce8.png Sean It probably includes the auto-generated "this day x years ago" albums and such Lars Jeppesen Also I think it includes "shared" stuff makapav All those Hangouts albums from Picasaweb in the background that are probably hidden in Google Photos. Morten Ulv Yep, this is the correct answer. You could see them in Picasaweb. One for each day. Tomáš Petrík I have almost that many albums with less than half the photos. Bryan Mine says 577 albums, but if i click the arrow to expand it, it only shows 3 (which is correct) Hexlattice Yeah, it makes a shared album every time you share even just one photo with a person... Kinda why I prefer sharing a photo via Hangouts or some other means. I don't like the clutter it makes in my albums. senor_heisenberg Under a thousand. whispy_snippet 11,049 Dominic Labbé Well.... 99042... 😮 Got my first digital camera in December 1999. BigTurk Beat me by almost 2000! I got my first digital camera in 2002. Kudos to you haha Richard Riker 13,148 Shaunak Guharay 18,679 . I expected it to be somewhere around 5000, but holy shit JW 12k Joshua Ferguson 61K, I've slowed down over the last couple of years Simps 11,222 photo's and 959 albums that I have not created. Boolean Corporation Also, people like to share their sites with me... it appears... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fbf6c5a8bcd2762fb0751916cddfc1c30c07e67b2f9bc325f16d5e39a091d222.png Stoffers I've also had 1,648,103 shared with my 2 sites. Boolean Corporation So it must be the total amount of public Google Sites out there. Dn Bro I have 8,973,294...I'm not really sure where they are. exadeci https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3db3521ceda62f5bd4e638a39d5ae74f7f04e770dc7485d7a198f8b445df4f99.png Anand Slightly higher than your count ;). What are these sites??? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/be13189cca9396d4e74c49fdc6aecbbbd4492ec5084d30989724d23a522efbbe.png Captain_Invisible 8.973.487 here 😲 Andrew Bone Just beat you 😉 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/707765784503bfaf20d2fe1327e82cdb628e443e39d108a823b2ddff6dd7e04f.png Roderick Gadellaa 8,973,436 :P Vasilj Milošević Nearly 4M over here. WTF? Where are those sites? Anthony https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a438430be5924c8714c16e394b9f093c1241bebf635d0d22be1752a0267c8d77.png Cheesespix Not a single :) I don't save my photos online. Corey Kinard Here, have a 🍪 Phil Miller Do you hide them under your mattress? BigTurk 97,222 :O Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher I don't have Photos listed! But I estimate around 250,000-300,000 photos. Makes Photos on my phone practically unsuable, somehow Google Photos insists keeping all thumbnails in internal memory which takes up 2-3GB of space. Photos uses up all the battery of my phone if I enable the app :-( dsDoan All of my photos are synced with Google Photos, but I don't take many photos, so it's under 1,000. Jason Brian Chapa 35,445 Maxr1998 Only slightly above 2500 pictures, that's​ everything I took in the last five years. I don't take many pictures, but that's also because I'm very selective with my images - I remove most "duplicates"/alternative photos which aren't that good and only keep the best images. Bryan How does the album count work? I've only made 3 albums but it says i have 577 albums. App Shah 65K + https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4077abf057824ff03b40189ea40058cc9fdea8e6160c0bcbde23fbeaaac30a52.png Martins Nkem I've got over 2200 photos mostly photos from my picasa album and photos i uploaded to Google drive about 3 years ago. I prefer not to use cloud storage for photos any more. Richard Markert Under 100, lol. Try under 10. I don't use Photos. VAVAMk_2 Over 1700...I need to take more photos I guess. Laurentiu 27,809 SchmilK EnHaggen Just under 200,000 photos over here. Took 6 days to upload my entire photo library via desktop app. Everything I've shot with my DSLR and phones over the past 13 years. Phil Miller 42 photos a day? Do you even have time to sleep? SchmilK EnHaggen I shoot a lot of bursts, plus it's a mix of me, my wife, and my 2 kids phones all synching to the same account (granted the oldest is only 7, but she has been know to take 42 pictures of a TV show lol) Vasilj Milošević 52.832 photos 3.784 albums :D Image upload bugs for me on disqus, so here's imgur link: http://imgur.com/a/qY6gw Jeffrey Heesch Only 7,770 for the time being, but I just recently got myself a DSLR, so I'm expecting my Google storage to hurt in the near future. Mr Wright 64,616 all nudes 😎 Dmitry Stepanushkin about 30000. Nudes will stay on local storage 😁 cadtek91 I don't think the Album counts are accurate. Lord Argyris 2,925 here. Everything since I got my Nexus 7 on December 31st, 2013, which is when I officially joined the Android ecosystem. I'm curious, where is the Sites statistic some people have posted? I can't seem to find that anywhere on my account dashboard. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f18afe5301756a2f37e6f449c2faf0ec975cf47ead995985d6cf0ee4cb56fe1c.png tapsboy 10,351 JG 64,884... With another 1,940-some waiting to upload as I type (literally just got back from an extended data-light/less vacation where I was the unofficial group photographer). A lot of the pics (especially from this trip) are burst shots. Trying to photograph something as we drove by so I just let it go to get the most tree-less pic... Or to make an animation or panorama pic. That, and of course, cat pics :) Hey, if Google is going to give me free unlimited storage... Might as well take advantage. Bryan Kolb Just under 200,000... Dre 44,153 Kevin Sword "Wekeend" poll? Guess so! 9,179 photos. Phil Miller 19,268. For my 20k photo, it will be a pick of my friend Harry Johnson. Akilesh Akil https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b22006051777d76bece05eecfcae428cdcf2381379fdc6e701e6c4f64988671.jpg Barron Roth I feel like I'm an edge case, Google Photos runs very slow for me 😔 an old screenshot, I probably broke 500k these days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d2363f77f2556cf6b91ee1f158be42694f8fcb74f9869a02f388dddcdc95e383.png Rob What are all those photos? Is your porn collection included in that number? Kidding ;) Your comment about the service being slow is odd, it should only load what you're looking at and not everything. But perhaps something goes wrong when the number is so high. Barron Roth I'm a photographer, so it shouldn't be too unusual! It's slow mostly during search or scrolling through historical dates. uthark 107,383 Dlang123 Photos ‌124,910 tu3218 If I upload photos to google photos that wasn't taken on my phone, will they be analyzed and sorted correctly by their date, location ,etc. Assuming all this data is attached to the file. Robert Porter Yes, any photo on Gphotos is analyzed. If they don't have the locations, I believe Google fills that info with your Google maps location during that time. HSidhu 000064 Photos :) Victor %01000000 David Zero smonkeyhouse Albums: 4,166; Photos‌: 249,245. I have it sync with my PC, and all my DSLR pics get uploaded Justin Osborne 15k, but probably half of those just since I got the Pixel, due to our first baby. Over 20GBs of HQ pics/video since then. Michael Zinfandel Rork 70,503 Level380 55K and counting. Leandro Brandão 10132. I backed up some old photos and used the photo scan app to scan others, maybe 100 or 200 photos. I use google photos since my first android phone in 2012, i was amazed how that worked back then, now is even better. Joshua Talley Pretty sure I saw over 100k several months ago... codingismy11to7 17k, in original quality... and I've recently been thinking about uploading my 90+ GBs of stuff from before gphotos existed... Willie Chalmers III I am definitely in the minority with only 2,140 photos. What do you people take pictures of? b_boogey_xl I've got like 25k photos but if I remember correctly, this isn't just Google Photos but any photo you have uploaded to Google across their many services, including Hangouts, Google+ Messager, Google Voice, Google+, Picasa, etc… I believe if you go to your About Me page you can see all the "albums" and photos you've ever uploaded to those Google services (not including Google Photos). Mike in KC 457. Guess I'm not much of a photographer... Saqib What is maximum free storage allowed with Google photos? tehboogieman They say unlimited for compressed images Miku is Best Vocaloid 10000 and counting Joshua Worth 83,689 😊 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ef968361c0424a651500b83acdd44d4fa19466201c00685b3a584e99d0e40e77.jpg Sherrie B 297,771 Daniel Rodriguez Looks like I've taken a picture or two in my time... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/505b72e38a4d6a15ced01c270253dc58d8777887f0c273491675ea1e322be65e.png Morten Ulv Jesus. What are all those photos of? You take hundreds of photos every day? I take maybe 10 000 per year of my kids, so that's a modest average of ~30 per day. Andrew Bone ~95% selfies 😉 Daniel Rodriguez Oh god, not if I can help it. No one needs to see that much of me. abc He takes a pic of every meal he's ever eaten. Daniel Rodriguez .. guilty as charged. Daniel Rodriguez Hah, actually, I'm definitely an edge case with an unusual situation: I have a little 'lifecam' thing that takes pictures every 30 seconds that I use when traveling around, so it generates thousands and thousands of pictures when using it. The company that makes it recently went under, and so the service they offered where they hosted the pics it took went down- I downloaded my pics before it went down, and uploaded them to Google Photos, all in the Unlimited storage when letting Google compress them (which is fine, the vast majority aren't high quality anyway). So far, no issues with it, Google claims unlimited storage when you use their compression, and, numbers above showing, they mean it. create812 Google is in an intense meeting now, discussing how to handle "whales" like you. Daniel Rodriguez Hey, they promise unlimited storage if using their 'high quality' compression, I'm just taking them up on the offer! Francisco Peña they gonna throttle you from taking any more pictures. Daniel Rodriguez I'm actually curious if they will, I upload tens of thousands at a time when I travel thanks to my lifecam, and so far haven't run into any issues or gotten any alerts. I tell the client to upload them using the Google 'high quality' compression, for which they offer unlimited storage if you use it, and so far, they've been as good as their word. Definitely not doing anything that's against terms of service, all falls within the service's promised offer, so if they did throttle me, I'd love to know why. There's a big difference between 'unlimited' and 'unlimited as long as you don't go over 50,000 photos' or something like that. Artem Russakovskii Around 35k for me. Dennis 64.498 - ich speichere mittlerweile ausschließlich dort.. ast00 3342. I guess I don't take many pictures. Roderick Gadellaa Somehow Photos doesn't show up for me in that list. It's supposed to be above Play Music, right? It shows Payments there for me. Weird? vwnut13 I'd have more, but they are in a "brand account" attached to my Gmail. Still accessable online, but no longer in the Android app. Thanks for breaking, then removing that feature Google. Trent 25,525 it was very low prior to getting my Nexus 5X when that and Local Guides launched. The Pixel has raised it somewhat, but getting my DSLR and traveling fairly often (only 8 countries so far this year, but about that many again planned up until December) to take pictures and backing up my RAW files along with JPEGs has made a big difference. Peter World Citizen I love cats. I've just over 5k of photos of pussies. Plus another 2k of food and cars/bikes. Jan-Lk Else Where's the no option? Javier180 Simply dont vote. McClain S https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4911bca160a898e3d9f1f092a2af15587d485f0ca9ef12ceb21637dcd00bd2a6.png Arvid Over a 100.000 photos. I did upload everything I have, including older ones I scanned and our Family archive (going back to 1960) Wilson I'm running out of storage :O Victor 4982 albums and 246688 photos. Everything since 1996 on my Amiga till now, where every picture received or taken with the phone gets automatically baked up. Erik 41000 for now. I hope AI will improve so I can find what I'm looking for. It would be nice not to get pictures of cats when I search for dogs, buses and cameras when I search for cars and picture frames when I search for computers for example. Oh, and face recognition is still not available in Europe. I guess Google doesn't want to upset EU more than they already have. Rob I have face recognition in Europe. Not sure how I did, but it's fairly easy to activate it. I think by a single-time usage of VPN and reset app data. Have had it ever since. Alenekbell Google is paying 97$ per hour!

James 53,235 so far. I have had a hard drive failure and if it wasn't for them being backed up, theses photo s would have been lost. sasu85 Backup in Google compressed resolution or at full resolution? Do you have also other backup (like hard drive?) Or not? James It just so happens that my pics are 12mp or less and I believe that is the restriction that Google has set. Many of my pictures are scanned pictures from old photos and every smart phone I owned (I always had them backed up). I do have them on my hard drive, but have actually been rethinking this as I see no benefit from having on my hard drive. Just 440. Removed all after switching from Nexus 5 to Pixel, and will do so after switching from my Pixel to something else. mcored Photos ‌66,423 Tom Daley settings say 7700 same folder on my server says 20000+ Hmmmm not sure whats happening there Timothy Vreeland 38k, so close to moving up in the poll bracket.

I really do not take many photos, most of what I do take is used for online sales or confirmation photos, so they get deleted after the transaction. Another large number is having info from hardware at work so I can enter it into a database when I get back to my desk. Again those get deleted once that data is entered. Alfonso Surroca 8K, and that's including the fact that I synced like 15 years of photographs from my desktop computer to my Photos account. abc This is more of a "how many photos do you take" question than a Google Photo question. benmarvin 16,405. And I don't even take that many pictures. Some of my photos go all the way back to Picasa days Indefinite Implosion Yep 15,608 and a lot are from before I had a smartphone/from my DSLR when I had a smartphone. Brandon I've got just over 5k, which is less than many people here but is pretty much every photo I've taken in the last 12-ish years. I try to remember to back up to my external hard drive now and again just in case, but otherwise Google is the only thing I use for photo storage, management, or editing. James Miller My wife takes pictures of our 5 boys daily with our DSLR. Whenever I put them on our NAS drive, I have them automatically backed up using the desktop backup client. I'm up to 116,053, but that number grows by about 1000 every couple of weeks. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a6190002ab404d0e7e513fe45d2931f9173bc76ab04c9c6bfc6167f5e961b10a.jpg Deb Newman I quit using google photo because my account got hacked and googles recovery system wouldn't verify it was me even though I knew most of the answers to their questions, finally got to speak to someone from tech support and still would not verify.

Kostas 💪🎩 Any way to put photos to a special place separate from the others, that aren't in your face all the time? Abhimanyu Seth Just 44,672 photos till now! philopek each as he likes but then i think the question is not very specific hence the answer doesn't provide much else than a sheer number. if the question had been "self made and unique images" that would have provided a more useful picture. while there certainly are photographers, selfie addicts and the likes, i know how many years it takes to produce a few 10'000 images of notworthy quality and uniqueness because i'm producing photos for the last 45 years now, all digitalized and stored safely, and at the times the pace of production was insanely high and still one gets' nowhere near some of the numbers that have bee mentioned here. further what are all the folks doing once google will drop a platform entirely. i remember that i have changed platform due to changes made by apple and/or google which is why all my images are now structred in simple folders and subfolders, storable and managable on every computer cross platform, no matter what some may decide. when apple changed from iphoto to photos for example most features were missing and to continue watching the library on apple-tv one had to purchase software without knowing whether it would meet requirements etc. i would like to know how many of those images are self-made and more or less unique, everything else is just claiming bragging rights IMO Ozl yeah, i will triple my photos and videos by the end of the year when i get the New Pixel Phone xD (hoping it still has that unlimited upload) Chris Foote 139,750.

Pro tip: Put Google Photos on your computer. If you're on vacation and you have Wi-Fi at the hotel, but Google Photos on your laptop. When you check in at the hotel, plug your phone up and copy/move all the photos over.

Years later, that foggy feeling that I spent so much time taking photos that I don't remember the vacation at all? And when you do have some time to sit down and reminisce, going through thousands of snaps feels exhausting, and there is too much emphasis on quantity of snaps than QUALITY? (I used to snap away 30+ pics a day on average, now cut it down to 5-6, keeping the phone away during events to actually enjoy the moment) Horacio Gómez 66.333 photos.

[Deal Alert] Get a $75 credit when spending $750 or more on a Pixel with Google Store Financing Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 8:04am PDTJun 5, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 27 Share on Facebook 25 Share on Twitter Total Shares62 Deals Google Pixel Pixel XL The Pixel is a great phone, but it's not sold by most carriers. Google make it a little easier to afford this device by making financing available. It's rare that Google discounts devices on the Google Store, but you can get $75 off a Pixel right now if you use financing. There are some caveats, but not as many as most carrier deals. The deal requires you to spend at least $750—the Pixel XL would certainly fulfill that, but a 128GB regular Pixel should work too. Hey, or you could just buy a few Pixels. Your call. Just sign up for Google Store Financing and keep your account in good standing. After two billing cycles, you'll get an account credit for $75. This deal also entitles you to the free Pixel case, which Google started a week or two ago. The Pixel is getting a bit old, and maybe you shouldn't hop on that train anymore. Still, this is a good deal. Source: Google Store Tags deals Google google store pixel pixel xl subscribe ...

I'll stick to the essentials Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Watch out, Spigen might sue you! Aaron With the LCD display, lack of waterproofing and ugly screen mounted selfie can, I'm really not seeing any essential for me. Rawhi Mohammad Good points.. to be honest, I'm looking forward to the uglycam, waterproofing yes, that would have been nice. LCD.. that might suck, I'm used to my AMOLED. But it won't hurt to try it out and see for myself. Aaron Hey I'm definitely not angry about another premium vendor on the market. And there's a lot to be excited about here. But about like the first gen Pixels, I was hoping for a little more. Rawhi Mohammad Definitely agree.. they could've justified it's price by tackling all these points. Wonder if anyone ever will BinaryTB Maybe if it was a Pixel C, who knows if Google will announce another tablet, so might as well get the only pure Android tablet currently available. T4rd New battery definitely revived my 6P. Went from this with early shutdowns at 10-30%: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e2cf19817b113fda177a0371891906cc98537e17585ef51f9862d7c355c8837.png To this with 4-5 hours SoT again and no early shutdowns: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d935df6962acf507febc9d3ee4bb9a7deb1c8c5b91fe814c91768238d96f1966.png Edit: Opps, replied to wrong comment, hah. But I see Edgar replied anyways below. Edgar Martin Hope it fixes mine also. Two more days until I get a new battery. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4c60dbd62abb2ed4ae54165974d0fe71c8b31a84df4ffa732379c98e1a7b3d6a.png T4rd Damn, that's pretty bad. So does it really only last like 1 hour of SoT then? lol Edgar Martin If that. Lol. It's on the charger most of the time. ☹️ Jay That's really bad. 😮 Tom Z Here's how bad mine has gotten. I just purchased a Nexus 5x from Newegg to hold me over until the Pixel 2 arrives. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ebfe8d90329e8d0be031b0030b1000ba8c797240fb1238e0ce206802427b2b5a.png T4rd Wow.. you know Google is replacing 6Ps out of warranty because of this, right? Or you could have just got that $10 6P battery I posted below and had a local repair place put it in for you for much less than that 5X costs. Jason Pagliaro Mine went into the reboot loop of death this weekend, sadly. Battery was getting bad but no early shutdowns, at least. TheDrunkenClam Is it easy to do this replacement? Plombir It's not easy for sure plus you need tools as well. I will just get a battery and take my phone to a reputable shop to get it installed. asianrage Most likely, get a replacement back and glass and such. The chance of damaging that visor is very high. T4rd It's not hard IMO, but I've had a bit of experience repairing phones, tablets, and other electronics too and it does require some basic phone repair tools; heat gun/blow dryer, plastic wedges/guitar picks, super thin metal pry tool or x-acto knife, and a small screw driver. Most phone parts come with most of these tools (my battery from eBay did), but I've acquired many from past repairs I've done. I replace the battery in my previous One M8 too, which was considerably harder than this 6P since you had to completely disassemble the phone sans the display to get to it. Fortunately on the 6P, once you get the housing off, the battery is easy to get to and replace from there. The hardest part on this phone is removing the bottom plastic panel and top glass without damaging anything (much). So it's important to have a super thin knife or tool to pry these pieces out.. I had to make due with a box cutter blade and got it off with minimal damage to the housing. Anfronie I'm thinking of doing this soon. Where can I get an reputable OEM battery that is not a knockoff? I don't want to do all that work if the replacement battery is crap. Thanks for any info! T4rd I got this one: http://www.ebay.com/itm/252482757101?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT Looked EXACTLY like the original OEM battery and a few others in this Reddit thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/66tzgh/if_youre_on_the_fence_about_replacing_your/#bottom-comments) bought that one as well with the same results as I have had. You can see pics of it there too next to the original battery. Anfronie Thanks a ton for the info! :D John Doe Google sent me a 15% discount "just for you" off of the Pixel XL. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6f6e48720cee18cef32533cfd87278a84f7cb2d33eb3bdfa5289ad659e1c1908.png Good_Ole_Pinocchio You didn't use it did you? John Doe No of course not LoL Edgar Martin Hopefully getting the battery replaced in my Nexus 6P this Wednesday will allow me to hold off until the next Pixel is release... If not then Pixel XL it is. T4rd It's annoying that Google refuses to discount their Pixel devices. The Pixel C is now a major rip-off at $600 and almost 2 years old. Makes you wonder if or how much they'll discount the current Pixel phones when the new ones come out. I'm guess they'll take a generous $100 off their current prices, lol. Good_Ole_Pinocchio They won't... they'll just replace them with the New Pixel. T4rd Probably.. which would be for the best considering they still can't even keep stock of them now, let alone when they're superseded. Jason Pagliaro And use the remaining inventory for warranty replacements. Cael What inventory? Jason Pagliaro Everything except the 5" black seem to be in stock unless I'm missing something. Chris G Hope they bring the financing option to Canada this year with the pixel 2. exzacklyright Pixel 2 tho... Might as well wait JG Yeah... Too bad they probably won't let us open a financing account now and start paying ahead for the Pixel 2... Get the $75 credit in August... Have half (or a fourth, depending if you do 1 or 2yrs) of the Pixel 2 paid off by the time it's released... Would result in less of a sting to the check book, especially Taimen turns out to be a tablet, about time to replace my Nexus 9... me me oooh I so need to spend $750. Cowboydroid Sad, Google. Just sad. James Briano Boss to Johnson: "I want you to handle all the Pixel sales. ALL the Pixel sales!" Johnson to his broker: "Put all my money in Samsung. ALL my money." Badouken Just need my 6P to last til end of October for the Pixel 2 to release! atc-tech Lol... "DEAL!" yeah.... Bruce Wayne Lol. $750 on a Pixel. abc $750 for a year old phone that was overpriced to start with. Ridiculous. Testraindrop Deal Alert? Spending 750$ or more for a Pixel? Now? Why?

The Google Play Music App Has Been Wiping Downloaded / Cached Music Stored On SD Cards, Google Is Fixing It David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2015/07/07 2:53pm PDTJul 7, 2015 206 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 118 Share on Twitter Total Shares282 Applications News If you've been wondering of late why exactly your cached and stored-for-offline-playback music in the Google Play Music app is disappearing every time you turn your phone off or reboot it, good news: Google knows that (now). And if you are experiencing that problem, I bet I can guess a feature of your smartphone: it has a microSD slot. And you probably have microSD storage enabled in the Play Music app. We heard from one reader who actually talked with Google Play support about this bug and initially got an extremely unsettling answer. Fortunately, that answer turned out to be wrong. For the sake of not confusing anyone by putting the full wrong statement in the post, allow me to summarize. A Google Play rep told this person that Play Music deleting cached or downloaded music on the microSD card every time it was unmounted or "unplugged" from the phone was a copyright protection feature. (Note: even the first part wasn't right - it also did it if the phone was rebooted or powered off). This person, most likely, then received a supervisorial scolding, because a second reply from Google Play made it obvious the issue was escalated, and the new rep made it clear this behavior is a bug. The reply is lengthy, so if you just want a summary, read on. I want to first apologize for the information we provided to you about the issue with subscription tracks being deleted from the SD card. After reviewing your case details, it looks like the previous agent you spoke with misunderstood the issue that you're reporting. We have taken immediate actions to address this which should prevent a situation like this from happening in the future. Again, I deeply apologize for not accurately understanding the issue you were experiencing and for not providing you with the correct information on the issue. I'd like to first explain how music is stored for offline listening. Music files that are downloaded to a device (phone or tablet) are only downloading a cached version of song's file, not the actual .mp3 file. This is done to help minimize the amount of space that the downloaded music takes up. This is also implemented to curb abuse of the subscription service as the download music is only accessible through the Google Play Music app for that device and account. This means that a user wouldn't be able to download music to an SD card and then take that SD card and use it on a different device as the music is chased to that device and account. With that said, music that has been downloaded for offline listening, either to the internal storage or SD card, should never be deleted without the user initiating the deletion. This is an actual known issue with this service. The good news is that we are aware of this issue and are actively working to get it fixed. Thanks for your effort in submitting those logs earlier, which helped make us aware of this issue.﻿ Essentially, Google Play Music shouldn't ever erase music from the microSD card unless you explicitly tell it to. That it does this is not an intended behavior and has nothing directly to do with copyright, although it does indirectly have a relationship there - more on that in a second. But the short version is if you're experiencing this problem, Google is working on addressing it, (and it sounds like that's probably mostly because our tipster, Michael, reported it to them). This statement does have some technical issues, though. Namely, the rep claims that offline-stored songs from All Access (this is important - versus music in your library) aren't kept as MP3 files when they're selected for downloading. Except he's wrong, because they are - they're just stored in a protected private folder (as a sort of basic DRM) where only Play Music should be allowed to play them (funnily enough, on Samsung devices the stock music player app also seems to be able to play them, though the metadata is stripped and the titles obscured). For songs in your library, there's no protection at all - you have access to those files on the external SD card and, so far as I can tell, they don't get wiped with a reboot or even unmounting the SD card. It's just the All Access stuff that seems affected. Anyway, the takeaway here is that Google is aware that some cached and offline music is disappearing for no reason if you use the external SD card storage in the app, and that they're looking into fixing it. Google has not replied to a request for comment on this story. Thanks: Michael Tags play music sd card not keeping songs play music sd card wiping subscribe ...

Thought my SDcard was junk. Nope.. just Bad Google. Austin Spangrud I bought a new one and haven't had the problem... NomNomNom OnePlus One - No SD Card - same problem. And I've 25,000 tracks up there. https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/3c0292/google_play_music_library_appearing_empty/ Lateef Alabi-Oki When will they fix the Chromecast issue where the client only plays songs for one hour or less before stopping? Or am I the only one with this problem? Justin W I experience this with Sonos as well as Chromecast. That sucks, but it doesn't happen if I cast from my PC vs. casting from my phone, so I just change that a little bit. It's almost as if the app is killed, but the app is still active and it just pauses. George Byers So it's a problem with the cast protocol itself? Google Play within the sonos app is a little big messy to use but it certainly never drops out. Justin W Sorry, I should clarify - this only happens when streaming from within the Play Music app. Using the Sonos app or the Sonos desktop player is fine, as is using music.Google.com to cast to the Chromecast. Simon Belmont I wish my Chromecast would load YouTube instead of acting like it will and then just disconnecting. This has been an ongoing problem for weeks now, and a factory reset does nothing. The backdrop home screen also takes ages to load. I had it working correctly for a short period of time and then we briefly lost power and it got messed up again (and yes, I use a surge protector), so I'm beginning to think it's just failing hardware (it's a launch day Chromecast). enoch861 You're able to get it to stream for an hour? Impressive. I'm lucky to be able to get it to stream for more than a song. MattE303 I have problems with streaming to Chromecast from GPM randomly pausing itself or getting "hung" so I need to hit play or restart the song, very annoying. Happens with both my phone Samsung S5 and tablet ('13 Nexus 7) and only when casting to Chromecast, not over bluetooth. enoch861 Issue also occurs on iOS devices. Picaso86 Some of the tracks will skip by themselves and GPM will stop completely. This is me just using my phone over Bluetooth. IT SUCKS!!!! Maleko Yep, highly annoying! HOWEVER I fixed it by creating a Tasker profile that kept the screen on when play music was open, not good for battery and as soon as the screen turns off it eventually stops playing.... Weird as it NEVER happens on bluetooth... A A Ron It happens with my Galaxy Tab S 10.5, but I do not have this problem when using my Note4 Mi6300M I too share this pain Simon Belmont Saw this on Artem's G+ a little while ago. I was like if that's true then FACEPALM X 1000. Glad it's just a bug and that Google is on the case. I do use a device that I cache music to the SD card, but I don't reboot it THAT often. JD This explains the battery hungry nature of GPM since the last few updates. GPM has been keeping the phone awake and really draining the battery when listening and when just sitting in the background. It's also invoking media server. hp420 YUP!!! I killed 1.5gb of my plan as soon as it activated before play music even opened. I watched my network meter cranking away, trying to figure out why all my data was disappearing...checked my network usage monitor and it turns out play music just decided all by itself it needed to start caching my entire library without even being opened!! NOT COOL GOOGLE!!!! You owe me 25% of this month's bill for killing 25% of my data without even being prompted to run, let alone cache anything!!! Mik "Essentially, Google Play Music shouldn't ever erase music from the microSD card unless you explicitly tell it to. ' Or you rented the content, and its now expired .. David Ruddock pray tell, what can you rent on Play Music? mechapathy Everything in All Access is more or less a rental. You pay for it until you no longer want access to the content. Leandro Cassis I almost get a new SD card because 2 of mine 32GB and 64GB wasnt working. WTF google! Austin Spangrud Nope! This issue has been affecting my LG G3. It deletes all of my music files from my SD Card. The ones that I own and are in the cloud. It's done it about 5 times in a 6 month period of time. The SD card keeps all my regular data but just deletes all downloaded music. It could be an LG problem but I think that this goes for both owned and not owned music... jab416171 I recently had a similar problem on my Nexus 6. Instead of deleting cached/offline music, instead the app decided that all of my playlists only had about 10% of the songs they actually had. Wiping the data of the music app did fix this, but it also wiped all my offline music, making me download it all over again. Pain to fix, but it appears to be working alright now. Guest Okay, little off subject, am I the only one who thinks Google Music needs a major UI clean up and overhaul? The now playing screen the biggest mess to me. Look to the picture... I aslo can't stand the new Navigation Drawer, I rather have my music tabs there, then a divider and the top charts, new releases and the other crap. raazman Yes. Guest Yes, I'm the only one or yes in agreement? lol, sorry for the mini rant... raazman Hah, sorry. I meant yes to the picture, I agree! The app is also quite sluggish at times compared to other apps, both Google's and other music apps. icyhotmike I have all access and it only works on 4g. The keyboard doesn't pop up sometime while searching. Shitty prediction services. The UI is years old... So are the bugs. But hey, we got a chromecast fireplace now Also when using "listen for music" and u click the card it brings u to the play store.... If i'm a subscriber why the hell am i gonna pay for a single song? Stupidity. hp420 This is why I don't pay for it anymore. I've submitted sooo many bugs and suggestions and they get ignored every time because the issue tracker has nowhere to post stuff for this app. Google wants money every month, but they apparently hate that they have it because they never want anytging to do with it. Se la vie...there's always pandora patcher, I guess. José Gómez I've had this problem with my Nexus 5 deleting cached music for the past month. Before, it would keep music cached until I deleted it. Now, it seems to wipe it everyday. It's a good thing I have "unlimited" data, because now I end up using 1/2GB of data a day just on Google Music. Before you ask, I don't have Wi-Fi at work. They're archaic like that. Colin Richardson My GF is having the exact same issue (Nexus 5), I was hoping that was what the article was talking about, but it wasn't. But your situation matches it exactly. She has whole albums set to "download/cache", but only 2 or 3 songs from certain albums left, (where once she had the whole album). Hopefully the fix for the Article bug, will also fix the bug you and my GF are having. José Gómez I'm hoping that it's caused by the same bug as well. Sorry your girlfriend is having the same problem. It's very annoying. I didn't discover my phone was doing that until I took a road trip and didn't have any data the entire time and only had a handful of songs to keep me company for 2 days. Very sad! Lula Jardim hopefully they fix this before i go out on vacation! or else i`ll have to switch to another provider ellett A bit of clarification. You said, "Essentially, Google Play Music shouldn't ever erase music from the microSD card unless you explicitly tell it to." There is an exception to this if you have cancelled or allowed your All Access subscription to expire. In that case licensing policy kicks in and all the music that you no longer have rights to should be deleted by Play. Rob rollings Ah, so that's why Google Play Music is eating up all my data hp420 I've been dealing with that for months and google wants nothing to do with reimbusment. They claim that's not their responsibility. REkzkaRZ Was wondering where that MP3 went! So they are working on a bug -- what about people that get their files zapped, do they get compensation? Doode About fuarking time. This has been driving me nuts. About a month or so ago I started noticing that the cache from Play Music dropped from multiple gigabytes to never going above 700 megabytes on my Nexus 5. hp420 What they need to fix is the cache clearing every time I update with play....but it doesn't happen if I sideload the apk. Nicholas Ruiz It used to do this to me all the time. Not a new issue Itchy_Robot Either that, of they were snooping on me and hearing me curse their names because it was deleting my music too! MireilleGDavis 22333Ultra Income source by police . < w­­­w­­­w.­­­­N­e­t­C­a­s­h­­­9­­.­­­C­­­o­­­m Dimitris Kanellopoulos Had this issue exactly. Went on a 4 month eurotrip with my van. Had it for paying music in the thousands of km I had to make. Guess what? After the app was stuck it cleared all music. I was furious. I contacted Google support and asked for a refund. They refunded me. Later on after I found finally a fast WiFi I redowloaded all 30 gb. Some days after same issue. I asked again for a refund. Got it. Sorry but shitty app. If anyone is interested I got the whole conversation via support mail. Picaso86 These "temp" engineers are screwing everything up. Get some real professionals behind this app Google. vicentk Play Music rustling jimmies as always. Every week i have to force close this damn app or reboot to be able to play any song. anyway they dont get any money from me anymore. what Yep, the app is buggy as hell. The only good thing is direct billing from carrier, but looks like it can't automatically prolong the subscribition after the month is over that way. All bugreports went to garbage bin. Considering a switch. CoreRooted My subscription using direct carrier billing auto renews every month. It might be a carrier thing for you. I'm on AT&T and it happens every month with no interaction from me. Azar Al I lgot to say for this: LOL Jerseysteve Good article, NOT COMPLETELY CORRECT. I have an HTC 1 M8, and I use the SD card, because my library, all of the music is MINE, not streamed, uses too much memory to keep on internal memory. As soon as they did their update, I was no longer able to access my music from the SD card, and Google play automatically downloaded all my music to the internal memory. I had no idea what was happening, as I didn't do anything. When I spoke to Google, they told me Google play would no longer recognize music on SD cards. Then she told me there are no plans to change this new policy. Now, I have music on my phone, but many tracks are missing, and using playlists is nearly impossible. Can you do a follow-up? jak_341 I'm really questioning the competency of Google's coders of late. They have been putting out some real trash lately. wampdog29 Yep. Hangouts has been real screwed up with the notification bug. I'm really questioning why I use their services and apps lately.... Cory Music that I have uploaded has been deleted from my account. Hopefully they are working on this too. alex weird ... have this relationship with a recent problem with wakelocks with 1013 audioin ?? Robby P Yea what about the app crashing every other song for the past two months CAN NOT PLAY THIS MUSIC AT THIS TIME please fix that $9.99 a months ads up Google... Lissy Forhol WTF......they better fix this NOW or give me all my damn money back. Seriously! alberteezy Anybody have a bug when oragnizing your playlist? Everytime I start organizing songs in the order I want them on my playlist this bug sets them back how the songs use to be. I've had this bug for more than a year already and its do frustrating. Thinking of jumping to Spotify. Frank Q. Guerrero Never had a problem...all of it works and for hours,too. Nexus 6 2014, Vizio 46'' flat screen, 2014 Google Chromecast. Play Pandora for hours...also Concert video's from Crackle "Third Eye Blind Concert" Played Pandora for 4 hrs or so...No glitches. Dharma Galaxy I tried buying one song from Google. I was told I could only download it twice, and when I did download it I had to fix up all the metadata. I went back to buying all my music from Amazon. Ryan Hanna Quick fix: throw your phone in the freezer. Alternative fix: drive over your phone with your car. Thor 100 Gig of music gone. Completely gone from SD card. Unrecoverable. taxandspend It happens with ANY pushpinned music. I know, because I don't subscribe to all access, and it has happened to me multiple times. Then the app thinks it's pushpinned even though the music is gone. So you have to un pushpin it, then re-pushpin it. Six Google Music still deletes then re-downloads my music about once per two weeks. LG G4 with library on external sd. richie I used to have about 100 songs, now i have about 10. Google play keeps deleting them, ffs i dont even want google play on my phone, if i disable...it just comes back and steals more songs, not to mention my phone is virtually useless, i have 400mb ram and google products take up over 350mb sitting idle, no matter what is turned off or disabled. screw you google, i will never contribute 1 cent to global empire of evil! Mind Games Try downloading all of your music at one time and watch what happens on your HTC M9 trust me you won't like it. Yes I use a 128 gigabyte card with plenty of room. If they were concerned about copyright they wouldn't let us download in the first place. Some songs do some songs don't but everything works fine on my BlackBerry Priv. TorokLev Do you know if it has been fixed by Marshmallow? Thanks, Heath T. I have downloaded songs to my library more times than I can remember. This has been an issue from day one on my Galaxy S5. I don't delete them - they just dissappear. I have never removed the SD card, and have never authorized deletion. The bottom line is Google Play is a crap app that Google has shoved down our throats then failed to fix. Torquil Harkness June 2016 and this issue is still occurring :-( Swooper Confirmed, recently got a phone with an SD card and this is happening every time I reboot. Chris Jeske Note 5 - no SD card - same issue. I'm on Big Red with expensive data and this is a real bummer every time I don't check before I leave the house. #firstworldproblems #butyeahfuqallannoying Andreas Engels Same Problem. Really sad! Ins year later nothing changed.. Will change to spotify. Florian Müller This big is still existing! At least for me, any news on this ridiculous and annoying bug? DaktariD FWIW, this exact issue still happens to my wife on her Moto X Pure. It just happened yesterday, aamof. Her entire library of local files was suddenly gone and Google Play started re-downloading it. As you said, it is set to store to a local SD card. The SD card was not removed (it hasn't been removed for months) and the phone has not been recently rebooted. Very mysterious. MetalMusicAddict This is still an issue even now. Happens at least once a month to me. A pita when I have 30gb+ of music to re-dl. Ethan Kwan Still not fixed lol. I have a Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro with Android 6 James Stewart LG G4 with an SD card for storage. Opened GPM this morning in the car and it told me I had no downloaded music. Never had this problem before, and the only thing I've done to GPM recently was update it earlier this week. Steven Fletcher Still not fixed. Galaxy S8, 2 restarts, 2 times music is deleted. Poik Sweet. It's still happening 2 years later. Very annoying when you're in Canada and have minimal data because the cost is so high and there's no notice or attempt to re-download when you're on WiFi. Dick move Google. Dick move.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / General Tech / Google faces $9bn fine in antitrust case with EU Google faces $9bn fine in antitrust case with EU Matthew Wilson 3 days ago General Tech Over the last several years, Google has been battling it out with the European Commission in court over various antitrust allegations. One of the first antitrust cases to be levied at Google surrounded the company’s ‘Shopping’ search engine, with the EU claiming Google skews results and causes harm to competitors. Both the EU and Google have made their cases clear at this point but the EU apparently remains unconvinced, with reports claiming that Google could be hit with a $9 billion fine. According to a report from Reuters, the European Commission could be ready to go ahead with its fine against Google in August. The amount could end up being around $9 billion, which works out at around £7 billion here in the UK. Google faced a similar issue over its shopping search engine in the US back in 2013. However, Google got off lightly back then, with the ruling telling Google to stop showing reviews from other sites in search results for products. However, from the sounds of it, the EU is going to be heavier handed. When the EU does land on a ruling, it will likely involve some sanctions, in addition to a monetary penalty, this isn’t the only ongoing issue Google has with the EU though. Outside of Shopping, Google is also facing antitrust allegations in the EU over its Android operating system, which comes with pre-installed Google apps and services. KitGuru Says: I have been covering the EU’s beef with Google since 2014, so this case has been dragging on for an awfully long time. No matter what happens though, Google can afford to take the hit.

Photo Credit: AP / Marcio Jose Sanchez advertisement | advertise on newsday SAN JOSE, Calif. - Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart" home speaker and device with features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The "HomePod" speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house.

It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. TechnologyLatest from Apple's WWDC17 conference The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. advertisement | advertise on newsday KEEPING IT REAL WITH VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences." But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. TechnologyCheck out Apple's just-announced tech products Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. Tweets from https://twitter.com/NewsdayBiz/lists/newsday-biz-staff NEW IPHONE FEATURES New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency" format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations.

Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention," meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. TechnologyiPhone through the years SIZING UP THE IPAD advertisement | advertise on newsday Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera — the same one found in the iPhone 7 — along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. WATCH THE WATCH Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Get the Biz Briefing newsletter! The latest LI business news in your inbox daily.

Released by University of Texas at Austin   Go to mobile page. Engineering researchers at The University of Texas at Austin have developed the most detailed and extensive local map of air pollution ever produced for an urban area, using specially equipped Google Street View cars to measure air quality on a block-by-block basis. This new hyper-local mobile approach to measuring air quality, which reveals that air pollution can vary dramatically even within a single city block, could address major air quality monitoring gaps worldwide. Researchers identified high concentrations of pollution, called ´hot spots,´ that were highlighted in the map and images. Some hot spots included warehouses, high-traffic intersections, car dealerships and drive-through restaurants. Credit:  The research team was led by Cockrell School of Engineering assistant professor Joshua Apte in partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), Google and Aclima, a California-based provider of environmental sensors. By integrating Aclima's sensor system into Google Street View cars, the team mapped air pollution in 78 square miles of Oakland, California, over an entire year, collecting one of the largest data sets of air pollution ever measured of single city streets. This new technique maps urban air pollution at 100,000 times greater spatial resolution than is possible with traditional government air quality monitors. Their approach and findings were published this week in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. The study included co-authors from the University of Washington, University of British Columbia, Utrecht University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Aclima and EDF. The team believes that their hyper-local mobile measurement system could be implemented in many cities throughout the world, providing detailed air quality information for citizens, families, local governments and scientists. The new technique could address major air quality monitoring gaps worldwide and has the potential to transform the way air pollution is monitored in urban areas as well as shed light on the health effects on city dwellers. Air pollution is a major global risk factor for illness and death, and the air pollution that people are breathing can be, at times, far worse than what official air quality monitors report. Most large urban areas have only one air quality monitor for every 100 to 200 square miles. In comparison, the UT Austin team's mobile approach maps air pollution every 100 feet, or at about four to five locations along a single city block. "Air pollution varies very finely in space, and we can't capture that variation with other existing measurement techniques," Apte said. "Using our approach and analysis techniques, we can now visualize air pollution with incredible detail. This kind of information could transform our understanding of the sources and impacts of air pollution." In many locations, the team's Google cars measured air pollution levels that were several times higher than at Oakland's official monitors. In their analysis, the researchers also identified many recurring hotspots where pollution on a single block was consistently much higher than elsewhere in a neighborhood. These pollution hotspots included the port, busy intersections, restaurants, warehouses, industrial plants and vehicle dealerships. "What surprised us is that there are consistently locations that can be as much as six times more polluted on one end of the block than on the other," said Kyle Messier, a UT Austin postdoctoral fellow and a co-author of the study. "Among other things, this demonstrates that people are getting disproportionate exposures of unhealthy air at some locations." This project is the latest phase of a partnership between EDF and Google, who have been working together since 2012 to map and measure a growing list of health and environmental risks, including hidden leaks from local natural gas systems. "Air pollution is largely an invisible threat, one that poses especially disproportionate risks in lower-income areas like West Oakland. This new method allows us to visualize the data so communities and policymakers can identify the sources of harmful pollution and take action to improve safety and health," said Steven Hamburg, EDF's chief scientist. The study's approach was designed to be cost-effective and easily replicated. For instance, research partner Aclima designed pollution sensing systems that made it straightforward to collect high-quality air pollution data on moving vehicles day after day. Driving more than 14,000 miles, the Google cars collected 3 million measurements of nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and black carbon pollutants in Oakland, generating the largest urban air quality data set of its kind. As the study's principal investigators, UT Austin's contributions included: Designing the data collection approach and directing where the cars drove on a daily basis. Developing data analysis algorithms to produce block-by-block maps of street-level air pollution from measurements made by passing Street View cars. Identifying neighborhood hotspots of air pollution. Determining how this approach could be efficiently scaled up to other urban areas. In the future, Apte hopes to take this mobile air quality monitoring approach to other major cities to help formulate a hyper-local map of air pollution in the United States that could help people make more informed decisions. "You could use this information when you're picking a school for your kids. Is there a school with a playground that might have better air quality because your kid has asthma?" Apte said. "This hyper-local information about consistent air quality can be really useful for people, especially those who are vulnerable because of age or health condition." The above story is based on materials provided by University of Texas at Austin.Translate this page: Chinese French German Italian Japanese Korean Portuguese Russian Spanish Related » Air  2/29/16  Study Celebrates the Success of EU Air Quality Policy Amidst Brexit Uncertainty Data  12/8/16  ★★★  Satellites, Airport Visibility Readings Shed Light on Troops' Exposure to Air Pollution Iowa  5/14/14  Clean Air in Iowa West  1/21/14  Made in China for Us: Air Pollution Tied to Exports Chinese air pollution blowing across the Pacific Ocean is often caused by the manufacturing of goods for export to  Traffic  2/13/15  Stopping at Red Lights Exposes Drivers to High Levels of Air Pollution, New Study Finds UK commuters spend an average of about 1.5 hours a day at the wheel.

Photographer: Ulrich Baumgarten/Getty Images Google, which controls more than 40 percent of the U.S. digital ad market, has decided to teach the world which ads are acceptable and which aren't. Starting next year, its Chrome web browser will block all ads -- including those bought through Google -- on websites that don't follow guidelines set by an industry group. This monopolistic move is meant to save the digital ad industry from itself. It would also have the side effects of making Google's business model more sustainable. Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's senior vice president for ads and commerce, delivered the warning to website owners in a recent blog post. Chrome, he wrote, won't show any advertising on sites that try to run ads that are designated as annoying by the Coalition for Better Ads, a group that, apart from Google, includes the second digital ad powerhouse -- Facebook, as well as content creators such as News Corp. and The Washington Post and major advertisers such as Procter & Gamble. The group has researched user experiences and concluded that internet users hate pop-up ads, self-launching videos with sound, countdown ads that make one wait before a page loads, and large sticky ads that don't go away as you scroll. Google is not the first browser maker to build in ad blocking functionality. Last year, Norway-based Opera Software did so, saying it wanted to motivate the industry to stop annoying viewers and increasing website load times. Like Google, Opera also declared it supported lighter ad formats, but didn't pick and choose websites on which to filter out advertising. Now, about a third of Opera users have turned on the blocking feature. But there are too few of them to count: Opera commands a 3.5 percent global market share. Chrome, with 54 percent, dwarfs all other players, and its threat to stop showing ads on certain sites is essentially an order to change or die.  It's not a nice move. Many will see it as a power grab aimed at weakening other players, who are already losing share to Google and Facebook. Content creators could point out that the two giants sell some of the most irritating ad formats, but the Coalition for Better Ads has no problem with them. Instead, it's helping Google wage war on the formats that bring in the most revenue for publishers. So why would Google expose itself to new accusations of abusing its monopoly position, especially given that its business keeps growing and so does the global digital ad market, which is expected to reach $223.7 billion this year and continue to make double-digit leaps until at least 2020? Google founders and executives have built such a powerful company because they've never allowed themselves to get stuck in the present or the near future. And the medium term looks troubling for the digital ad industry because of the quickly growing use of ad blockers. On desktop computers, the use of such software is increasing while web traffic from them is going down. But that's not what should worry Google, whose strategy is based on mobile dominance; on mobile devices, the use of ad blockers is rocketing. In 2016, Google's ad sales increased about 18 percent. The number of mobile devices that use an ad blocker grew 38 percent (to 380 million), according to PageFair. Much of that growth is in Asia, one of the most promising regions for advertisers. Increasingly, Google and other companies exploiting advertising-based business models are facing a world in which ads are sold, providing a robust revenue stream, but people find ways to opt out of looking at them. That gives fraud -- primarily the practice of "showing" ads to bots rather than real people -- an increasing weight in the industry's total revenues. Google needs to get real people to keep looking at ads, and it appears to believe that making other people's ads less intrusive is the way toward that goal. I doubt it's going to solve the problem, mainly because the guidelines are written in a way that ensures that viewers will continue to see annoying ads from Google and Facebook -- if not from many other sites. Clear thinking from leading voices in business, economics, politics, foreign affairs, culture, and more. Share the View Sign Up Google appears to believe that the digital ad market's fundamental contradiction between people's desire for free content and their annoyance with ads is a matter of balance. That belief is apparently shared by some content producers: A few of them have signed up for Google's relaunched Contributor program, which allows sites to charge a small fee -- usually $0.01 per page -- to show a visitor no ads at all. But the program did badly before the relaunch, and very few content sites have signed up for it now. To most readers, paying to see no ads is essentially like paying protection money -- something to be avoided with the help of a comprehensive ad blocker, not a pro-Google, pro-Facebook one.  Content creators, like any other manufacturers, are on shaky ground when people can consume their product free of charge. A strong paid subscription base is the only good insurance against a future digital advertising crisis, which Google is trying to stave off with its attempt to join a trend it can't beat.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Essentially, machine learning refers to computers or software platforms “learning” over a period of time. It has been around almost as long as computers have existed, but today’s machine learning is remarkably different. In the past, machine learning was largely driven by patterns, trends, formulas and algorithms that were fed into the machine or software in question by programmers. In other words, it was not autonomous or truly “smart,” in the sense that it couldn’t analyze a set of data and learn on its own. Modern machine learning is different. It is autonomous and has given birth to modern AI, or artificial intelligence. That’s because it relies on big data or cloud platforms, which contain a huge trove of information for the system to analyze. Programming, computations and algorithms are still involved, but unlike the systems of old, the new machine learning techniques allow the platform to change and evolve over time as it’s fed new information. In a recent study by the Accenture Institute for High Performance, at least 40 percent of surveyed companies said they already use machine learning to improve sales and marketing performance. This includes market segmentation and cross-channel marketing. Other examples of machine learning include Google’s self-driving car and the way websites deliver targeted ads to customers. Self-driving cars constantly analyze the environment around them, including events and actions that are taking place, like pedestrians walking across the road, other vehicles cutting them off and so on. The vehicle’s brain essentially taps into a store of data — collected over a lengthy period — to decide what something means and what to do about it. In the case of the pedestrian or aggressive driver, it knows to slow down and allow them to take the lead as safely as possible. Sites like Amazon, Netflix and even Facebook use machine learning applications every day. They deliver targeted ads and content to customers through a series of datasets, namely what customers are looking at, what they’ve searched for, and what they’ve bought in the past. In Facebook’s case, the platform knows what kind of content users have liked and are interested in, and how often they engage with others in the community. Furthermore, machine learning is used for things from autonomy and AI-based systems to software testing and development. Software testing, in particular, is one area where machine learning can do a lot of good. How, and what challenges need to be overcome before it truly reaches its full potential, are what we’re going to discuss next. How Machine Learning Is Helping Automate the Testing Process For computer developers, machine learning has evolved considerably. In the past, programmers and developers had to input code — a language that allows them to speak to computers, if you will — in order to provide instructions. The computer would carry out actions according to whatever language the developer used, be it HTML, JavaScript, C#, Ruby or something else. Today, coding is still involved and still necessary, but the way developers interact with systems is different, at least when it comes to machine learning. Now, developers act more like trainers, guiding the system and offering tips or advice. The system carries out the thinking and work to achieve various actions. It may sound crazy to describe a machine or computer as a “thinking” thing, but it’s true. The computer can tap into an endless supply of data to piece together everything it needs to make decisions and carry out various actions. In most cases, the way in which the system figures out an answer is a mystery. Many AI or autonomy-based machine learning platforms come with pre-built testing profiles that carry out steps on their own. The development team knows what’s happening on a basic level, but may not truly understand what the software is doing behind the scenes to find the answer. Machine learning is how Facebook determines what stories and content show up in your News Feed. It’s how Google Photos can identify faces in your uploaded images. It’s even how Microsoft has enabled real-time support with Skype Translator. So, how does this affect testing and development? The answer is simple. The machine or platform in question is able to not only automate, but influence, the way in which testing takes place. At any given time, it knows what may constitute as a bug, but more importantly what may be causing it — due to past data. It may also be able to make suggestions to remedy the problem in real time or even have the capacity to go fix the problem on its own. Artificial intelligence has the ability to parse extremely time-consuming tasks and converting the entire development and testing phase into a more convenient experience for developers. Of course, it’s going to take some time to perfect the systems and backbone that can do such a thing, but we inch closer every day. What Challenges Must Be Overcome Before Heavy Adoption of Machine Learning? Nothing is perfect, and modern machine learning systems and processes are no exception. There are still quite a few challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome before the technology can be considered ideal for all applications. To start, you need to conduct a few initial tests — not just to gather necessary information, but to have a control you can use to compare results with. You’ll never know if the machine in question is spitting out the right answers if you don’t fact-check before putting it into motion. Then, you need to ensure you’re feeding the computer the right data and providing access to the right stores of info. To do so, you need to accurately define what information, data sets and values the system requires in order to perform its duties. For example, you can’t ask the computer for information about your customers and their habits without feeding it specific details about them. Another challenge is finding a way to convert the data you have or need into a more useable form. That is, machine learning systems aren’t always going to go through the motions and spit out a direct answer. You may need to employ data analysts and scientists to sort through trends and patterns for something you can tangentially use. Without first overcoming these challenges, there’s no way to get a machine learning system to work for you and your goals. Daunting though it may be, it is entirely possible and worth the investment. If you’d like to learn more about AI/machine learning be sure to check out TMC and Crossfire Media’s newest conference and expo, Communications 20/20, happening July 18-20 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. The event will focus on the next wave of technology and innovations that will transcend the importance of person to person contact, disrupting the future of the entire communications industry. Find out more HERE.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. passed $1,000 six days after Amazon.com Inc. crossed the same threshold, showing the sustained investor confidence that tech giants can outmatch older companies. Amazon’s rise reflected a bullishness in e-commerce, coming despite bigger sales in brick-and-mortar retail. Likewise, Alphabet shareholders see that TV ad budgets will continue to gravitate online, where Google dominates. Alphabet’s transition just under two years ago to a portfolio structure has also buoyed investor confidence in the stock. Alphabet’s shares hit $1,006.2 on 10:43 a.m. in New York Monday, a 37.9 percent increase since August, 2015 when Google became Alphabet, splitting off its audacious, earlier stage ventures from the core Internet business.  During that time, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat oversaw cuts to the company’s massive spending bill and decelerations on some pricey initiatives, like its fiber broadband service and drones. Alphabet issued a rare share buyback last year. Google’s primary ads business has kept expanding too, dodging any threat from the spread of mobile devices. Ad revenue reached $21.4 billion in the first quarter, a 19 percent annual leap. And the company has shown some signs of growth in its cloud-computing business, an area of massive investment internally. Along with cloud-computing, Google has heaved considerable investment into artificial intelligence, such as voice-computing. Many investors believe that investment positions Google well to hedge against any threats to its web search business a shift in computing brings. Prospects for the one-time "moonshots" -- the company’s experiments in industries like health care and transportation, now called the "Other Bets" -- have looked brighter this year. Verily, Alphabet’s medical business, closed a $800 million outside investment from Singapore firm Temasek. Alphabet cut investment in its fiber broadband service, a move investors appeared to cheer for the slowdown of capital in a competitive industry. Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving car unit, is in position to lead the competitive autonomous transit market, according to a note last month from Morgan Stanley. The analysts wrote that the unit could be worth around $70 billion by 2030 -- a prospective value that is not baked into Alphabet’s current share price. © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

Google Photos will now suggest photos to archive Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 3:44pm PDTJun 2, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 52 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares143 Applications News Google Photos has become a very convenient way to back up all your photos... all of them. Even all the receipts, addresses, and other junk. Google recently added archiving to get that stuff out of the main timeline, but now it's going a step further by suggesting photos to archive. It sounds like the feature we spotted in a recent APK Teardown. The suggestions will appear as a card in the Assistant tab inside Photos. Google will use its machine learning magic to figure out what's in the photo, marking potentially unimportant ones for archiving. You then have the chance to evaluate the selections before proceeding, so you won't accidentally sweep up any important pics. New! See suggestions for photos to archive, so you can move photos you don’t want to see in your main library. See ya later, receipts 👋 pic.twitter.com/RpjBquGN5G — Google Photos (@googlephotos) June 2, 2017 Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. All the images you archive will remain in albums and search results. They're just more out of the way. This feature is still rolling out, so give it time. Manual archiving is already available, though. Tags apps Google google+ photos photos subscribe ...

Mine is automatically turned on when I just checked it right now. needa Nothing for me. DP2 XL needa I have thousands duplicate type photos. I seriously hope it advises me to archive all of them. I have been waiting for Google to do something like this for a while now. Maybe if I can get rid of all the clutter, I can stick stuff in albums and clean it all up. Mustafa Selçuk Öztürk I got the update and it shows under Assistant Cards, but no suggestion yet. Waiting patiently... myssi it must be processing your photos brkshr This archiving feature is a godsend!!! My wedding and my honeymoon tour of 7 national parks takes up at least a third of the photo's I have saved from the past 15 years or so. I already archived about half of my wedding photo's. Now I just need to get through the metric ton of honeymoon photo's I have of nature and driving and it will be much easier to find the important photo's. Dennis Ulijn It's also important to solve this problem from the other end: start realizing which photos matter to you. Nature pictures? Architectural pictures? Portraits, group pictures? Nature and architecture are abundant, I just try to shoot the people I'm with, mostly spontaneously or without the knowing because I want to capture the moment. I don't have to archive many photos, and I do take a lot of pictures of my kids. abc Some people like nature more than people. :) Besides, the easiest solution is not take any pics at all because someone else in the group will do it and share them with you. Dennis Ulijn I doubt my toddlers will take a good picture ;-) well, to each their own. Sometimes avoiding the problem is simpler than solving it. Lourdesdcruz Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Facts Cool feature Erstam I wish they would adopt a folder and sub folder like structure. I would still much rather organize my photos that way. It suggested i archive all my screen shots. Meh. Rudder2 JunkMail I agree with you. I hate Google Photos' organization and use Google Drive instead because I like organizing my photos with folders and subfolders. Another beef with Google Photos is it doesn't recognize my Google Drive Photo folders as albums. Google has a lot to learn how people like to organize photos. The Google Drive help line tried to get me to switch to Google Photos and I gave him an ear load. I spend hours organizing my photos on my computer and Google just doesn't care and wants us to do it again in their app. Anon They need to let us archive entire folders automatically, like the whatsapp image folder Vlad > Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. No it's not. This is EXACTLY how it works in Gmail and how I count on it to work. Everything is still categorised, it's just not there when opening gmail.com mxwp it's actually a tiny bit different in that the All Mail in gmail (or Done in Inbox) that has your archive and all your non-archived email. The Archive section in Photos only has the pictures that you specifically archived. Vlad I agree. Mildly annoying if you ask me, since having a separate category would be more useful for favorites, not clutter. Is there any favorite/star thingy in Google Photos, btw? Cakefish This is completely unrelated to the article but I'm getting very impatient waiting for Motorola and Nokia to reveal their 2017 phones. Do you have any news on release dates for us AP? DynamikD I'm glad about this feature. Great way to hide photos that you may not want to people to view. I don't quite understand why people still complain about not being able to create folders though. It's an archaic way of doing things. That's why you can create albums within photos. Serves the same function but it leverages meta data which is more efficient and makes searching for photos and videos easier within the app. Yuri Vidal if google photos would only give me the option to NOT BACKUP my screenshots... i hate it! (Samsung stores screenshots under /DCIM/Screenshots so, google photos thinks they are pictures and uploads them. There is no way to unselect this folder, since it is a subfolder of the pitures folder... PLEASE FIX THIS! Ozl This is just great! i have a lot of files being uploaded on wifi from whatsapp and some i forget to delete, and others are just there just in case, so yes, Thanks Google! Calvin Mccoy I get the job done from comfort and ease of my own home, via easy projects that just needs only from you a Desktop as well as online connection and I am also joyful than ever before... After six months in this project and also i acquired compensated in sum 36,000 dollars... Basically I make up approximate to 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours time every day.And outstanding point relating to this task is usually that you can easily organize time period at the time you get the job done and for how long as you wish for and you get a check each and every week........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Fruity101079 I thought this archive function was useless, and it is for me, but when i see your comments, i guess i was wrong. It seems to be useful to a lot of you who didn't take time to organize and arrange your photos.
