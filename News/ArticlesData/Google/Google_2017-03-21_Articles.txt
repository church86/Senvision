Home Industry Technology Google unveils Android O; currently available as Developer Preview Google unveils Android O; currently available as Developer Preview According to reports, the new version of Android is available as Developer Preview. By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 22, 2017 8:10 AM According to reports, the new version of Android is available as Developer Preview. Google has officially announced Android O. According to reports, the new version of Android is available as Developer Preview. If you possess Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel, and Pixel XL phones, the Pixel C tablet, you can avail it by downloading the official ROM from Google Server. But one can not use it on the phone that is daily driver. Reports are saying that to maximize battery life, the US technology giant is going to put a number of automatic limits in the background on apps. Apart from this, “Android O introduces notification channels to provide a unified system to help users manage notifications,” Google Developer handbook says. There are reports that, Google wants to make it easier for you to find answers and recommendations on smartphones without having to think about what to ask its search engine. Its new feature, called “shortcuts,” will appear as a row of icons below the Google search box. Where now you’d have to ponder and then speak or type a request, the shortcuts will let you tap the icons to get the latest weather, movie showtimes, sports scores, restaurant recommendations and other common requests. Watch this video The shortcuts will begin appearing Tuesday in updates to Google’s app for iPhones, Android phones and its mobile website. The Android app will also include various tools such as a currency converter, a language translator and an ATM locator, which you can also summon with a tap. Those tools may eventually make it to the iPhone as well, although Google says it doesn’t know when. These shortcuts are the latest step in Google’s quest to turn its search engine into a secondary brain that anticipates people’s needs and desires. The search engine gleans these insights by analyzing your past requests and, when you allow it, tracking your location, a practice that periodically raises privacy concerns about Google’s power to create digital profiles of its users. Based on the knowledge that Google already has accumulated, its shortcuts feature may already list your favorite sports teams or recommend nearby restaurants serving cuisines you prefer. Shortcuts also show how Google’s search engine has been adapting to its audience, now that smartphones have become the primary way millions or of people stay connected to the internet. Since more than half of requests for Google’s search engine now come from smartphones, the Mountain View, California, company has adapted its services to smaller screens, touch keyboards and apps instead of websites. Early in that process, Google tweaked its search engine to answer many requests with factual summaries at the top of its results page, a change from simply displaying a list of links to other websites. Voice-recognition technology also allows you to speak your request into a phone instead of typing it. The transition is going well so far. Google’s revenue rose 20 percent last year to $89 billion, propelled by digital ads served up on its search engine, YouTube and Gmail. Although shortcuts won’t initially show ads after you tap them, Google typically sells marketing space if a feature or service becomes popular.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Android O Developer Preview released, developers only By Rei Padla - March 21, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Oreo or not, Google has officially rolled out the latest Developer Preview for the upcoming Android O. We mentioned it a couple of days ago and the timing is just perfect. For those wishing to check out the new Android OS, you can’t easily because this one is made for the developers ONLY. Take note of that: developers only. Unlike in the previous years where anyone can download, this one isn’t. The tech giant warned that this isn’t part of the Android Beta Program so don’t even think about getting it if you are NOT a developer. As much as Google wants more people trying out the OS and giving helpful feedback, the Android team is being more specific this time. This is a real developer preview–again, only for devs. The team shared they’ve been working on engineering process improvements so more partners can check out their work earlier. This first preview isn’t perfect yet, obviously. Google is still doing plenty of work on the features, performance, and stabilization but Android O is working. More developer previews will be released in the coming months so it will be ready for a wider audience before the public launch later this year. Here is a rundown of the new APIs and features of the Android O as listed by the Android developers: • Background limits. These are additional automatic limits to what can be done by the apps in the background. This is one way to improve battery life and interactive performance of the device. Specifically, Android O will limit three areas: (1) implicit broadcasts, (2) background services, and (3) location updates. Developers are encouraged to make apps that have small impact on device and battery. Using the developer preview will show the devs how automatic background limits will affect the OS. • Notification channels. Notification contents now have app-defined categories, visuals, and grouping. They allow developers to give mobile users “fine-grained control” over their notifications and more specifically for every channel. • Autofill APIs. Action for Autofill login details has been made to work more easily. Autofill support allows autofill apps to work the same way a keyboard app does. New APIs are free for devs to use if they are planning to add autofill. • PIP for handsets and new windowing features. Picture in Picture (PIP) display allows users to watch a video while doing another task like email or chat. The feature is now ready for smartphones and tablets. Feel free to use the PIP mode and set custom interactions or aspect ratio. • Font resources in XML. Fonts in XML layouts can be used and defined in Android O. • Adaptive icons. Adaptive icons can be shown in different shapes. Android O can also animate interactions of the icons with the launcher, sharing dialogs, overview screen, and Settings. • Wide-gamut color for apps. Imaging apps can now be optimized for devices that boast of a wide-gamut color capable display. Developers will need to load bitmaps with an embedded wide color profile like Pro Photo RGB or AdobeRGB among others. • Connectivity. High-quality Bluetooth audio codecs like LDAC codec are now supported. Wi-Fi Aware technology has been added as well while ConnectionService APIs have been extended. The latter allows third party calling apps to work with the System UI. • Keyboard navigation. “Arrow” and “tab” navigations are improved as Google Play apps should start working on Chrome OS. • Audio API for Pro Audio. This is made for apps that require high-performance and low-latency audio. The new API allows audio apps to read and write data via streams. • WebView enhancements. For enhanced security and improved app stability, multiprocess mode by default is enabled. A new API will handle errors and crashes usually experienced by an app. Google Safe Browsing will be more useful in verifying URLs for WebView objects. • Java 8 Language APIs and runtime optimizations. More Java Language APIs are added and Android Runtime is made faster. • Partner platform contributions. Several fixes and enhancements to Android by silicon partners and hardware manufacturers are very noticeable. Developers are encouraged to make their apps compatible for Android O. Using the Android O Developer Preview will give you an idea what to do. Test the app by getting a device system image or emulator system image. You will see what needs to be changed and then update your app. It is highly recommended that you publish to Google Play the app. The Android team has listed Android O’s preview timeline, behavior changes, new APIs, and support resources on the O Developer Preview site. Note that this preview already includes the SDK for testing on the latest Google devices like the Nexus Player, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel, Pixel XL, and Pixel C, as well as, the official Android Emulator.

Managing director of Pure SEO Richard Conway says the introduction of the Google Shopping platform to the New Zealand market will allow users to search for products on online shopping websites and compare prices between different retailers - ultimately making it easier to save money. “Kiwis using Google may have already started to find a ‘carousel’ of images of products and their prices at the top of the search results. “What used to be a manual process of opening each site and checking for the correct product and lowest price will now take a fraction of the time,” says Conway. “Most consumers don't search past the first page of search engine results but this ‘prime real estate’ is often dominated by those businesses with the largest marketing budgets - not necessarily the lowest prices,” he says. Conway says recent research into New Zealand shopping habits found that more than half (53%) of shoppers compared products and pricing online before purchasing. The research also found search engine results were the most popular online source of pre-purchase information with almost four in ten (39%) consumers using them. He says in addition to businesses targeting the domestic market, many New Zealand exporters will also benefit from the introduction of Google Shopping as it makes it more cost effective to reach global markets. “What this will mean for Kiwi businesses is a levelling of the playing field against dominant larger competitors. “As the cost to reach each consumer comes down, those Kiwi businesses which sell direct to consumers will find it easier to compete with the marketing spend of larger players,” he says. Conway cites the example of one business which was able to reduce their marketing spend with Google by 45 percent in a recent trial of the Shopping platform. “New Zealand businesses spend tens of millions each year advertising online and this is expected to reach $900million by 2020. “The introduction of new technology like Google Shopping will help improve the online shopping experience for Kiwi consumers and we expect it to open up new markets for Kiwi retailers almost overnight.” Conway says that Google Shopping will not replace the traditional text adverts and will help anyone with an ecommerce presence in their ability to compete including bricks and mortar with a smaller ecommerce presence. “Research has found that this new advertising service actually complements traditional AdWords, as when a consumer is faced with both Shopping and text ads, more than 90 percent visit the website and 83 percent make a purchase. “Because of this, we expect to see to see businesses incorporating the new technology rather than replacing an existing one,” he says. -Ends- © Scoop Media   Tweet         Business Headlines | Sci-Tech Headlines BUSINESS, SCIENCE & TECH > >   Reserve Bank: Wheeler Keeps OCR At 1.75% Reserve Bank governor Graeme Wheeler kept the official cash rate unchanged at 1.75 percent, as expected, and reiterated his view that the benchmark rate doesn't need shifting for the foreseeable future.

The latest version of the app is 2.17, and it adds three big new tools, including one called Double Exposure that lets users blend two pictures into one. See also: Best Photo Editor Apps for Android 2 weeks ago Google stated that the new Double Exposure tool will let users choose from different blending modes. They added that these modes were inspired by analog film techniques as well as digital image processing. You can see an example of the final results in the image above that shows New York City scenes that appear to be inside glass containers. Another new tool in the Snapseed update is Face Pose, which will users correct the pose of portrait based on three dimensional models. Finally, the new Expand tool will offer users a way to increase the size of their canvas, along with a way to fill up all that extra space using content from the original image. Snapseed 2.17 also has some other smaller improvements, including adding local looks and QR looks support to the Brush tool and Stacks Brushing. This looks like it will be a solid update for photo editors on Android, especially the new Double Exposure tool. We would imagine that we will see a lot of blended images posted by Snapseed users using that new feature. Be aware that the update is still rolling out so it may take a little while to reach your device.

Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Updated: March 22, 2017 11:04 am Android O developer preview has just been released Google has just released a developer preview of Android O. We still don’t know what the O stands for, but have a good idea of what are the features being pushed via the new operating system. Dave Burke, Google’s VP of Engineering, says it is still early days and there is still plenty of performance and stabilisation work that needs to be done on the OS. Here is a look at the new Android O features  # Google seems to be going for the biggest pain point in smartphones as the one thing it wants to solve first. So Andorid O will come with additional automatic limits on what apps can do in the background, thus saving battery life even more. # The new notification channels feature gives users control over a certain type of notification which they can block or snooze in one go. You will no longer have to manage all the notifications as if they were the same. # Google is making autofill easier by adding platform support for such apps. So once you select which autofill app you want to use, it will be able to fill passwords and other details for you across the OS making life much easier. # There will be picture-in-picture support for apps across the OS, so you will be able to minimize the video if you have to do something else. Developers can even specify the aspect ration and set custom interactions on the reduced window. # For those who love wireless audio, Android O will bring in high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs such as LDAC codec. Plus there is AAudio, a new native API for apps which need high-performance, low-latency audio. The Android O Developer Preview includes an updated SDK which can be tested on the Android Emulator as well as on Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel, Pixel XL and Pixel C devices. There’s also an emulator on testing Android Wear 2.0 on Android O.

The leak could discourage people from relying on these apps, but on balance they provide good security and are simple to use. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 140.64 -0.83 -0.59% Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▼ 55.31 -0.02 -0.04% Cousins Properties Inc CUZ ▲ 8.12 +0.01 +0.12% LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE LVMUY ▲ 43.14 +0.30 +0.70% Consumers may have lots of reasons to want truly private communications with family, coworkers, and colleagues. Secure messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal are designed to help by using encryption to make sure only the people sending and receiving messages can read them. (All the people in the conversation need to be using the same app.) The material on WikiLeaks discussed methods the CIA was developing to get around these apps. For consumers interested in protecting their communications, it may have seemed as though hackers—whether they worked for a government or a criminal ring—could break through the encryption. Security experts quickly tried to debunk that idea, explaining that the apps themselves were secure, while the CIA had found ways to compromise smartphones, snooping out private messages before the secure messaging apps could do their work.  The truth is a bit more complicated. Some messaging apps may have almost unbreakable encryption, but they also have potential blind spots that can compromise your security and privacy. That doesn't mean they are useless, any more than door locks are irrelevent just because they don't prevent all break-ins. Here's what you should know about phone security in general and encrypted messaging apps in particular. The four options we describe are all well-known and can be used free of charge.  First, a Phone Security Refresher Imagine that you're typing a personal message on your phone before sending it to your spouse, Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, accountant, or boss. And to do this you're using a messaging tool such as WhatsApp or Apple's iMessage. If someone is literally looking over your shoulder, you don't expect the messaging app to keep them from reading it. The same idea applies if a piece of malware is doing something like taking screen shots or tracking your keystrokes—the messaging app isn't going to offer much protection in that situation. That's why the first step in protecting your communications is to safeguard the whole phone. “Any and every app relies on secure hardware and a secure operating system,“ says Joseph Bonneau, a post-doctoral researcher at the Applied Cryptography Group at Stanford University. “There’s no way around that.” Here's how you can protect your smartphone: Update Your Operating System After the CIA documents that allegedly described smartphone vulnerabilities were leaked, Apple released a statement saying that “many of the issues … were already patched in the latest iOS.” However, according to company figures, more than 20 percent of users had not yet installed that operating system. These users were missing out on the newest protections. The situation with Android phones is similar. Most of the hacks, or exploits, described in the CIA documents affected phones running versions of Android 4.0. That’s several years old, but many phones still use it. Users should update their operating system, and if you can’t because your phone is too old, consider buying a new one. Several security pros recommend the Google Pixel, which is likely to always have the latest OS updates from Google—phones from other brands have their own versions of Android, and these are updated less consistently. “If you can afford it, any Google-branded phone is going to have updates available” whenever security improvements come along, Bonneau says. "Some of the carriers have been really behind with their updates” of other phones. Set a Lock ScreenNo pass code, no security. A lost or stolen phone with no lock screen can give a stranger open access to your Facebook and other social media accounts, along with your email account—and anyone with access to your email can probably change the passwords on everything else, from American Express to Zappos.  Avoid USB Charging StationsDon't use a data port (i.e., the USB port) to plug your phone into public charging stations or public computers. “It’s best to use a power [adapter] and plug it into an outlet,” says Richard Barnes, Firefox security lead at Mozilla. “But sometimes you have to charge your phone and you have no choice. You can buy a device called a USB filter—they’re also known by a more colorful name, USB condoms—which will make sure that only power goes through the USB connection and not data.” And now, on to the secure messaging apps. WhatsApp WhatsApp is one of the most widely used encrypted messaging options. Last year, the company added end-to-end encryption by default for all Android and iPhone users with the open-source protocol used by the Signal messaging app (see below). WhatsApp is easy to navigate, and chances are some of your friends already use it. Getting Started Once you download the app, you’ll be asked to provide your name and phone number, which you’ll then verify with a six-digit code texted to your phone. The app will also ask for permission to access your contacts. If you expect to use WhatsApp with just one or two people, you can deny the request and simply type in your contacts' phone numbers to text them. Achilles' Heel WhatsApp allows users to back up messages to cloud providers such Google Drive and Apple's iCloud, but these backups will not be encrypted. (If you back up your phone to a computer, your messages will remain secure as long as you enable full-disk encryption.) When setting up the app, users can choose whether to back up daily, weekly, monthly—or never, the most secure option. Keep in mind that your contacts might be backing up messages to the cloud.  And then there's the fact that WhatsApp has been owned by Facebook since 2014, which may give pause to some users. Last August, WhatsApp announced that it would start sharing user data with its parent company. The content of messages isn't divulged—they're encrypted, after all—but other information is.  According to a WhatsApp spokeswoman, "WhatsApp provides some account information people share at signup, along with things like device information and some metrics about when and how often people use WhatsApp." One way the data is used, she says, is to provide "more relevant ads on Facebook" to consumers who use the social network. Confide Founded in 2013, Confide recently made the news when it was found to be popular among political operatives and White House staffers. Confide says its app uses “military grade” encryption and boasts innovative features, notably one that lets messages get revealed bit by bit and disappear immediately after they’re read. The app was briefly in the headlines again when security researchers said they'd found it vulnerable to hacking; the developers say they've fixed the problem. Getting Started After downloading the app, you'll be asked to enter your first and last name and a phone number or email address. You'll also have to set a password. After verifying your number or email, Confide will ask for access to your contacts—you can say no, if you prefer, and enter phone numbers manually. After you view an offer to upgrade to a paid version of the service, you'll be able to send texts.  Achilles' HeelSecurity experts, including the cryptographers who work with encryption, have been raising doubts about this app for some time. The first issue is that Confide’s encryption protocol is proprietary and its developers have not released detailed technical specifications. That's not the way WhatsApp or Signal operate, to give two examples. Confide "came out of left field, and the people behind it weren’t well known in the crypto community,” Bonneau says. And because the software is a secret, he says, "you can’t review the code to verify claims or find flaws. [Encryption programs are] very brittle—the designs are very complicated, with thousands of lines of code—and it can take just a slight error for everything to break.” Then, in early March, researchers from IOActive, a security firm, claimed that after reverse-engineering the app they found “numerous security vulnerabilities” that would allow hackers to impersonate users, decrypt messages, and get users’ contact information. Confide says the security holes have been patched with the app’s latest update, and according to a company statement, “not only has this particular issue been resolved, but we also have no detection of it being exploited by any other party.”  Signal Signal uses an encryption protocol that has been available for review by outside experts since 2014, and its code has been examined and lauded by several leading cryptographers. “Its crypto is pretty revolutionary” says Matt Mitchell, an info-security consultant and host of monthly cryptography-instruction gatherings in New York City. The company’s servers store very little user data, such as the last day the app was used. Getting Started After downloading the app, you’ll have to verify your phone number with a six-digit code that is sent via text message. The app will ask to access your phone’s contact list. (According to Signal, this data is quickly removed from its servers.) Android users will also be asked whether they want to set Signal as their default messaging app. Depending on what phone you’re using, Signal offers slightly different features on iOS and Android phones. “In iOS, for example, Signal can’t block messages or mute notifications,” Mitchell says, “so if you have your iPhone set to block someone, you will still get Signal messages from them.” Achilles' Heel Signal is favored by info-security pros we consulted, and the problems with it are considered small potatoes. By default, Signal sends users an alert in the phone’s lock screen, displaying the sender’s name as well as the start of the text message. If this troubles you, you can disable notifications completely via your phone’s settings. Better yet, open the Signal app, go to its settings, tap Notifications, and change “Show” to “No name or message.” You’ll still be notified when someone sends you a Signal text, but your phone lock screen won’t announce who it’s from or what they’re saying. Signal is heavily used by people such as international aid workers and journalists but is less popular among ordinary consumers. This means you shouldn't assume your friends and family are already using the app. If you want to send them encrypted messages using Signal, you'll probably have to get them to sign up. iMessage Apple’s proprietary built-in texting app seamlessly introduced end-to-end encryption to millions of iPhone users in 2011. Today, more than 1 billion devices use iMessage. That's an advantage because if you and a friend both have iPhones, you can enjoy encrypted text conversations without a visit to the App Store.  Getting Started There’s nothing to download—iMessage is preinstalled on every iPhone and iPad. Achilles' Heel It's difficult for security researchers to evaluate iMessage—that doesn't necessarily imply that it has weaknesses, but it does make some experts less eager to recommend the app. Even if you are sending a message to another iPhone user, you don't know if the communication is encrypted until you hit Send. It depends on what features the other user has turned on and off in their settings. If the message you send pops up on a blue background, the message is encrypted; if it's on a green background, the message has been sent as a conventional text message and is not encrypted. Additionally, the app lacks a feature that security pros appreciate in Signal and WhatsApp. With both those messengers, the sender and recipient have a way to verify their encryption keys—though odds are good that most users have never done this. Without going too far into the technical details, you can burrow down through a couple of menus to get a QR code and a long string of digits, then compare notes with the other participant in the conversation. This is a way to make sure that your messages are not being decrypted and read or otherwise tampered with en route. That option isn't available for users of iMessage. Whether you care probably depends on just how much you worry about someone trying to intercept your communications. Consumer Reports has no relationship with any advertisers on this website.

You find it everywhere, which means it absolutely must work on devices of every size, shape, and spec. Now that you can use Android apps on ChromeOS, that opens them up to gadgets with trackpads, keyboards, pens, and who knows what else. Android works in your car, on your TV, and on your face. All of which makes being an Android dev complicated, and gives Google a lot to consider as it works on upgrades. Google just released a few tidbits about the next version of Android, which arrives later this year and is known for now as Android O. (Not that I’m speculating, but Android Oreo? Android Oh Henry? Android Orange Slices Because You Should Eat Healthy Now?) No word yet on a roof-raisingly cool new feature like Assistant, but O offers enhancements that appear designed to help developers build apps for the en tire Android ecosystem.

Android O places specific caps on “implicit broadcasts,” which wake up background apps when you connect to Wi-Fi or take a picture. It also limits what an app can do in the background. If you’ve ever checked your battery settings only to discover an app you haven’t used in three days sapped 34 percent of your power, this is very good news. If you own an entry-level phone with a small battery and poor connectivity, it is even better news. To help curb notification overload, Android O features something Google calls “notification channels” that let developers segment different kinds of notifications—political news vs. sports news, maybe, or text message alerts from your family vs. everyone else—and control them individually. The notification shade also groups notifications by channel, making skimming through them easier. Most of the other new stuff is aimed at making Android better across devices and form factors. Android O standardizes what happens when you press an arrow key on your keyboard, and supports adaptive icons that better match those on whatever screen and layout you’re looking at. It supports third-party calling apps, so you can take all your calls through WhatsApp or Telegram. Picture in Picture now works on phones and tablets, and even lets you launch windows on secondary displays. Apps can access more fonts and a wider color gamut. And, in a move sure to save the sanity of complicated-password-havers everywhere, a new Autofill API lets you use an app to fill in passwords, addresses, and more. Google won’t formally launch Android O until the I/O conference in May. Count on more features to come. Google timed this result mostly to get devs thinking and planning, and perhaps even start tinkering (Google calls it a “canary” release, which is only slightly too ominous). It provides another clear indication that Android is much more than a wildly popular mobile operating system. Google clearly considers it the everything operating system, one capable of powering your phone, your TV, your car, your tablet, your computer, your watch, your lights. Until now, Android has been an excellent phone OS haphazardly tacked onto everything else. Google hopes to make it a single platform that works and looks right, no matter what you’re looking at. It’s getting there, one adaptive icon at a time. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

PETALING JAYA: Google is honouring legendary Malaysian actor P Ramlee with a Doodle today, on the occasion of his birthday. P Ramlee was born on March 22, 1929, and would have turned 88 had he been alive. Unfortunately, the man whom many Malaysians consider the greatest entertainer the country has ever produced, passed away at the young age of 44 on May 29, 1973. His final resting place is the Kampung Baru Muslim cemetery in KL’s golden triangle. P Ramlee’s artistic achievements left an indelible mark on the cultural history of Malaysia. He was a prolific actor, director, writer, singer, musician and composer who contributed to more than 60 films and composed around 250 songs. After his death in 1973, Malaysians kept his legacy alive, honouring him with posthumous awards and naming halls, museums, and other buildings after him. His popularity cut across people of all races as his diverse artistry transcended the entertainment scene and won the people’s hearts. Malaysians will always remember him sporting a thin moustache and a checkered suit, his head cocked slightly to the side. His classic films, including comedies Labu dan Labi, Ali Baba Bujang Lapok and Madu Tiga, and dramas Enam Jahanam and Anakku Sazali are among the all-time favourites of Malaysian movie buffs.

In fact due to that video, YouTube cancelled the second season of the YouTuber’s show and also removed him from “Google Preferred”, which is basically an advertising service for platforms that are deemed “brand-safe”. That being said, it seems that Google wants to further clamp down on such content and have announced that they will be taking more proactive steps in removing ads from extreme content, whether it be websites or videos, that are created to attack or to harass other people based on things like gender, race, religion, and so on. According to Google, “So starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. This change will enable us to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites.” One of those changes is to introduce a higher level of brand safety that is set by default which means that brands can safely advertise without worrying about being associated with objectionable content. Presumably the goal here is to take away advertising from such websites in hopes that it might discourage them, or at least make it so that they can’t profit from their content. We’ve seen this done before where Google and Facebook have banned/restricted fake news websites from using their ads network. Filed in General. Read more about Google and Legal.

The Doodle captured him during his prime, as explained by Google. Today’s Google Doodle celebrates the 88th birthday of Malaysian icon, Tan Sri P. Ramlee. https://t.co/uIvl6RbDzu #GoogleDoodle pic.twitter.com/NxlM2ZSm8G — Google Malaysia (@GoogleMsia) March 21, 2017 “Today’s Doodle highlights the Malaysian legend’s diverse artistry and shows him as people best remember him — sporting a thin mustache and a checkered suit, his head cocked slightly to the side,” the tech giant added. The site also the two concept drawings for the Doodle with two different poses. Google said the final design was a combination of the two, since the team liked them so much. Mr P Ramlee was born Teuku Zakaria Teuku Nyak Putih, and began his acting career in Singapore in 1948, before later moving to work in Malaysian since 1964 until his untimely death. He was best remembered acting and directing in evergreen comedy and drama films such as the Bujang Lapok series, Ibu Mertuaku, Anak-Ku Sazali, Madu Tiga, and Nujum Pak Belalang. The Malaysian icon passed away from heart attack, and despite his success, was said to have died penniless.

Well, sort of: Google just dropped a developer's preview build of the next-gen mobile OS revision, along with a heap of details on just what it brings to the table. Obviously, we expected an Android O to follow last year's Nougat, but the sudden launch caught us all off-guard. Right now, Android O really is meant for developers to start learning from and improving their apps. It's not available via a public beta channel, but it can be manually downloaded to be flashed to an array of Google's own devices, including the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus Player. Even if you don't plan on jumping on this first-run build, it's worth finding out what to expect when Android O gets finalised later this year – and has a proper name (Android Oreo seems to be the consensus hope/expectation). Right now, most of the enhancements seem relatively minor, but they could collectively go a long way to helping your Android do more, act smarter, and last longer. And we'll surely hear plenty more when Android O takes the stage at I/O 2017 in May. Here's what we know so far. 1) BETTER BATTERY LIFE Google's Doze mode in Android Marshmallow and Nougat helped preserve precious battery life by keeping your phone in a lowered power state when in your pocket, but now Android O promises to do even more to prevent apps from wasting your charge. Android O will limit what apps can do when they're idling in the background of your phone, which means cutting off broadcasts, background services, and location updates. Developers may need to find ways to ensure that their current apps can still function with these new automatic restrictions, but the end result should be more efficient, longer-lasting devices. We should see a bit more speed around Android O, as well, as the Android runtime is said to be twice as fast in some benchmark tests, according to TechCrunch. 2) MORE NOTIFICATION CONTROLS Thanks to a new feature called notification channels, you'll be able to customize certain kinds of categories of notifications from apps – that way, you can block some less-useful notifications and ensure that only the essential ones pull you out of your daily routine. This could be handy with filtering notifications from certain conversations in messaging apps, for example. Android O also lets developers change the background colour of a notification, useful when there's a critical alert, and can display more content in the collapsed form. You'll also be able to silence some notifications and have them return later, while developers can have timed notifications cancel themselves out. 3) PICTURE-IN-PICTURE MODE Android O will provide a native picture-in-picture framework for video apps, allowing users to continue watching footage in a small window while navigating elsewhere. This will be handy for continuing to watch, say, a YouTube clip or Netflix TV episode while reading email, summoning an Uber car, or navigating around the OS. Granted, the window will be absolutely tiny on your average smartphone, but it's still better than having to stop and start every time you need to do something else on the screen. 4) ADAPTIVE ICONS Android device makers often use their own custom OS skins, which can throw off how the look and shape of app icons correspond with the rest of those you download from the Play Store. Luckily, Android O is going to do something about that. Developers will be able to create so-called "adaptive icons" that offer multiple shape options that automatically shift based on your home screen theme. Circle, rounded square, or something in between? Android O hopes to keep your home screen grid uniform and unified by enabling creators to pack in multiple options. 5) IMPROVED SOUND QUALITY As headphone ports become less and less standard, more people are being pushed towards Bluetooth earbuds and cans… which they might be wary of. But Google hopes to help ease the transition with some audio quality enhancements in Android O. According to The Verge, Android O will bundle in "high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs" to improve the quality of your wireless cans, and utilise Sony's LDAC technology to allow for Hi-Res Audio playback over Bluetooth. Sony has apparently been a major partner for that inclusion, contributing 30+ feature enhancements and more than 250 bug fixes to Android O so far. 6) BETTER AUTOFILL SUPPORT This might sound boring, but it could actually be a really helpful feature: Google is implementing new Autofill APIs that allow users to select password and data-storing apps to act as their preferred autofill app. Why is this important? Because many people use password management apps to secure and store their vital info, and now Google will make that implementation seamless. According to Google's Dave Burke, VP of Engineering, it'll function much like choosing a keyboard app. 7) MULTI-DISPLAY SUPPORT We'll have to see just how useful this is to the average user, but Google is promising some kind of multi-display support "for launching an activity on a remote display." This might be something that would come in handy for corresponding with a Chromebook, now that Chrome OS is becoming more and more friendly with Android, or maybe there's more to it. Right now, we only have this limited info from Google's developer preview documentation, but we'll stay tuned to see if it ends up being something really compelling. 8) IMPROVED KEYBOARD INPUTS On a Chromebook and feeling left out with some of these phone-specific additions? Worry not: Android O will also allow app developers to enhance keyboard navigation, making it perfect for moving through apps and games when seated at a Chromebook or another Chrome OS-based computer. The more that developers tap into that functionality for arrow and tab movement, the more comfortable it'll be to actually utilise typically touch-based experiences on a computer. And that will go a long way towards creating that harmonious paring of operating systems that Google seems to be striving for.

While Google doesn’t specify exactly what changes/improvements it has made, the post does emphasise “a big priority on improving a user’s battery life and the device’s interactive performance” by reducing background app behaviour. Also mentioned is the new “notification channels” feature, which will allow developers more control over different notifications.

But unless you have a very recent Nexus or Pixel device and are brave enough to flash the images yourself, you’ll have to wait for the final release or, at the very least, an OTA update from the Beta program. In the meantime, however, Google has given enough appetizers to have Android fans salivating for the coming Android release, which is going to be a rather big one based on this list. A good part of the announced Android O features have already been leaked before, so it’s pretty much a confirmation of those. Picture-in-Picture, for example, is really coming and not just to tablets but also to smartphones. The Adaptive Icons feature is a bit amusing. Apparently, it just means that a single icon can have different shapes, like square, rounded square, and circle. There are quite a few under the hood enhancements as well, and chief among this is the new limits on background activity. The aim is to prolong battery life by reducing resource usage of apps that are running behind the scenes. These include apps that constantly update themselves in the background as well as those that constantly try to get a fix on the phone’s location. This could trip up app developers though, so it’s probably a good cue to ensure their apps will still behave properly in Android O. Android O is also putting a lot of focus on audio. In addition to a new AAudio API for low-latency sound, Google has worked closely with its hardware partners, specifically Sony, to improve wireless audio handling via the Bluetooth LDAC codec. Google boasts that its hardware partners have contributed significantly to improving Android O, though doesn’t go into much detail where and how. Although not as radical as the change from Dalvik to ART, Android O’s platform changes will still probably rock the Android boat at its core. Especially with the addition of Java 8 language features for developers. This is probably why Google is putting out the developer preview extra early and, unlike before, outside of its beta preview program, to give devs a chance to get started ASAP. For the brave and adventurous who want to experience the big “O” for themselves, check out our handy guide on how to get and install the latest Android version on your compatible device.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   AT&T halts its advertising on YouTube over content ‘promoting terrorism and hate’ By Ethan Baron / March 21, 2017 at 5:58 PM This post has been updated. Google has just been hit with some powerful pushback against content that appears on YouTube. AT&T said March 22 it had stopped advertising on all Google platforms except for search. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” the company said in a statement emailed to USA Today. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” British media were reporting March 22 that Verizon, car rental firm Enterprise and pharmaceuticals giant GSK also pulled non-search ads from Google platforms. “Verizon’s advertisements were appearing along side videos made by Wagdi Ghoneim, an Egyptian cleric who had been banned from the US over extremism, and Hanif Qureshi, whose teachings inspired the assassination of a Pakistani politician,” the BBC reported. And with regard to the controversial YouTube content, Britain, also, is not amused. Its government, along with cosmetics giant L’Oreal, car firm Honda, The Guardian newspaper and others who advertise on Google’s YouTube were distressed to learn that their ads were matched on the video-streaming app with extremist and offensive content. “We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way,” the British government said in a statement, according to CNN. Advertisements from well-known brands “ended up attached to videos by extremists, including hate preachers and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke,” The Guardian online newspaper reported. L’Oreal said it was “horrified” that its ads had shown up beside “extreme” and “negative” material, CNN said. The cosmetics firm did not describe exactly what “immediate action” it was taking to remedy the problem, but Google “has found itself at the center of a British storm in recent days after major companies from supermarkets to banks and consumer groups pulled their adverts from its YouTube site after they appeared alongside videos carrying homophobic and anti-Semitic messages,” Reuters reported. Alexi Mostrous, investigations chief at Britain’s The Times newspaper, tweeted that other companies pulling ads from YouTube because of the content included VW, Toyota, Volvo, Heinz and U.K. supermarket chain Tesco. The outrage and ad-yanking that greeted the results of The Times’ probe pushed Google to respond — and it appears the company may go beyond keeping advertisers happy, to put heavier restrictions on YouTube content. “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values,” Google’s chief business officer Philipp Schindler said in a blog post March 21. “So starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. “This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories.” Schindler hinted at tighter controls in general over YouTube’s content. “We won’t stop at taking down ads,” he said. “The YouTube team is taking a hard look at our existing community guidelines to determine what content is allowed on the platform.” Google has a big job ahead if it plans to live up to its tougher stance — according to Reuters, more than 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute.   Photo: Technology workers outside at Google’s campus in Mountain View (Bay Area News Group) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: ads, Advertising, anti-Semitic, content, David Duke, Google, Heinz, Honda, Ku Klux Klan, offensive, Philipp Schindler, Tesco, Toyota, VW, youtube   More Posts in Big Tech Google Maps to allow users to share location so friends, colleagues can see them on a map March 22, 2017   Elon Musk unhappy with Trump’s NASA bill March 22, 2017   Apple heads into Snapchat territory with Clips March 21, 2017       Share this Post Tweet       VaultDweller73 Hey look,, no one’s here.         Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Will AirPods end up being bigger for Apple than the Apple… Amazon ‘ripping consumers off’ by tricking them… Elon Musk unhappy with Trump’s NASA bill Sexual assault on Facebook Live: Girl, 15, allegedly… AT&T halts its advertising on YouTube over content…     Archives Archives Select Month March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital   About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2017 Bay Area News Group.

Others to pull the plug, temporarily at least, are the BBC, Guardian newspaper group and McDonalds UK.This news was published in The Nation newspaper. Read complete newspaper of 22-Mar-2017 here.

Managing director of Pure SEO Richard Conway says the introduction of the Google Shopping platform to the New Zealand market will allow users to search for products on online shopping websites and compare prices between different retailers – ultimately making it easier to save money. “Kiwis using Google may have already started to find a ‘carousel’ of images of products and their prices at the top of the search results. “What used to be a manual process of opening each site and checking for the correct product and lowest price will now take a fraction of the time,” says Conway. “Most consumers don’t search past the first page of search engine results but this ‘prime real estate’ is often dominated by those businesses with the largest marketing budgets – not necessarily the lowest prices,” he says. Conway says recent research into New Zealand shopping habits found that more than half (53%) of shoppers compared products and pricing online before purchasing. The research also found search engine results were the most popular online source of pre-purchase information with almost four in ten (39%) consumers using them. He says in addition to businesses targeting the domestic market, many New Zealand exporters will also benefit from the introduction of Google Shopping as it makes it more cost effective to reach global markets. “What this will mean for Kiwi businesses is a levelling of the playing field against dominant larger competitors. “As the cost to reach each consumer comes down, those Kiwi businesses which sell direct to consumers will find it easier to compete with the marketing spend of larger players,” he says. Conway cites the example of one business which was able to reduce their marketing spend with Google by 45 percent in a recent trial of the Shopping platform. “New Zealand businesses spend tens of millions each year advertising online and this is expected to reach $900million by 2020. “The introduction of new technology like Google Shopping will help improve the online shopping experience for Kiwi consumers and we expect it to open up new markets for Kiwi retailers almost overnight.” Conway says that Google Shopping will not replace the traditional text adverts and will help anyone with an ecommerce presence in their ability to compete including bricks and mortar with a smaller ecommerce presence. “Research has found that this new advertising service actually complements traditional AdWords, as when a consumer is faced with both Shopping and text ads, more than 90 percent visit the website and 83 percent make a purchase. “Because of this, we expect to see to see businesses incorporating the new technology rather than replacing an existing one,” he says. -Ends- Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url Trackback-URL  Print This Post comments feed for this post Tweet   No comments yet.

Through a partnership with Google, stunning imagery from BC's wild places has been added to Google Maps, complemented with interviews with BC locals, imagery, drone footage, immersive 360° video, and featured businesses on the new BC Journeys platform www.bcexplorer.com/journeys. In 2016, Destination BC and their partners were loaned two Google Street View Trekkers -- wearable backpacks outfitted with 15 separate cameras that collect 360° panoramic imagery in remote outdoor locations inaccessible by car. From June to September, teams from Destination BC and regional tourism partners from across the province, hiked the most remote parts of British Columbia from the Canadian Rockies and the mystical islands of Haida Gwaii, and through 10,000 year old ice caves and by fossil dinosaur footprints. Over 105 days, the Google Street View Trekker traversed 983 kilometres on almost 200 treks, travelling by foot, horse, boat, floatplane, and helicopter. Alongside the Google Street View Trekker, Destination BC sent a crew of expert content creators across the province to capture the stories and culture of British Columbians in those special places. These creators captured interviews with locals, drone footage, and 360° video and photography, highlights of which are now featured on the new BC Journeys platform, and will be distributed to millions of potential visitors around the world. This is the largest Trekker mapping project ever undertaken between a provincial tourism marketing organization and Google in Canada. Destination BC worked closely with its regional tourism partners to select unique locations that showcase British Columbia's spectacular nature and exhilarating places. An overview of the project can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH0ywVEr-Ds Quotes: Marsha Walden, CEO, Destination BC "There are over one billion monthly users of Google Maps. Through these Treks and our new interactive platform, BC Journeys, we can give people a window into our wilderness like never before -- creating a connection before people even leave their homes. Combining this powerful, immersive video footage with compelling, authentic stories creates an augmented reality experience that is a pretty potent recipe for driving visitation." Shirley Bond, Minister of Jobs, Tourism and Skills Training and Minister Responsible for Labour "The Google Trekker project and BC Journeys platform will give people across the world a first-hand look at BC's beautiful terrain. We are seeing a record number of international visitors and we are widely recognized as a technology and creative industries hub. I'm sure even more people will be drawn to our province once they see these new state-of-the-art virtual recordings from Google and Destination BC." Nicole Bell, Google Street View Trekker Expert "We're incredibly proud to partner with Destination BC in this Trekker project. We've worked together for years to bring the world to British Columbia and bring British Columbia to the world. These new Street View images, especially some of the more remote locations in BC, are an important part of Google's goal to create the world's most comprehensive, accurate and usable map. More than one billion people around the world use Google Maps every month, and we are thrilled to share some of British Columbia's iconic landscapes."

For more information about Destination BC's programs and services, please visit: www.DestinationBC.ca BACKGROUNDER Using Google Street View, British Columbians and people from around the globe can now virtually hike in some of the province's vast wilderness and be inspired by the powerful nature they see around them. British Columbia joins a select group of bucket-list Google Street View Trekker destinations such as the Pyramids of Giza, the Grand Canyon and the Galapagos Islands. Destination BC team members were trained by Google to use the specialized Street View Trekker equipment. The Trekker weighs approximately 18 kilograms (40 pounds), and is the size of a large hiking backpack. It's about 1.5 metres (4 feet) in height when set on the ground, and when worn, the camera system extends 60 centimetres (2 feet) above the operator's shoulders. In addition to the Google Street View Trekker footage, Destination BC captured more than 40 interviews and narratives, drone footage, 40 terabytes of high-definition video footage, hundreds of high resolution images, 24 immersive 360° videos, and chronicled the work of more than 50 tourism businesses. These multimedia assets will be distributed to potential travellers in key markets through Destination BC's marketing campaigns. There are currently 176 new BC Google Street View Treks now featured on Google Maps, with 14 more to be uploaded by Google. Here is a sample of the Treks: Sunshine Coast Trail Kettle Valley Trail (Myra Canyon) Blackcomb Mountain (Dekker Loop) Lake Magog (Assiniboine Lodge) 108 Lake Accessible Trail Anthony Island, Gwaii Haanas Bridge Glacier Pacific Rim (Schooner Cove Trail) Windfall Lake (near Tumbler Ridge) Find treks in British Columbia by reviewing the BC Journeys platform, or through Google Maps, by searching for BC's Google Street View Treks. (A list of all hikes can be found here: http://www.destinationbc.ca/Marketing/Consumer-Marketing/2017-North-America-Marketing-Initiatives.aspx) Here's how you can see BC's Street View Treks: Search for a place in Google Maps. Drag the yellow 'Pegman' to a place on the map. The blue areas on the map show where Google has collected 'Street View' content. To move around, hover your cursor in the direction you want to go. Your cursor becomes an arrow that shows which direction you're moving. To see where you might go next, look for the "X"; click once to travel to the "X". To look around, click and drag your mouse. You can also use the arrows to the left and right of the compass.

It's finally here (for devs) Will Google's operating system be an 'oh baby' or an 'oh dear' moment for programmers? 22 Mar 2017 at 00:40, Thomas Claburn Google on Tuesday published a developer-oriented preview of Android O, which turns out to be a software sequel rather than softcore erotica. Despite the cringe-inducing caveat that "it's early days" – the public relations equivalent of nutritional supplement disclaimers – Google engineering VP Dave Burke manages to outline a handful of useful improvements coming to the Android world. A note on the download page offers a less trite version of that message: "Caution: Developer Preview 1 is for developers only and not intended for daily or consumer use." Android O continues the battery storyline that played out in Android Nougat. Google's avowed goal is to improve device battery life and responsiveness to interaction. Toward that end, the software limits what apps can do in the background, a sensible alternative to gambling with more energy-dense and potentially combustible lithium-ion batteries. "These changes will make it easier to create apps that have minimal impact on a user's device and battery," said Burke, pointing developers to documentation on background execution limits and background location limits. Google's dev literature explains that apps running in the background will be limited in how they can access background services and that apps will no longer be able to use manifest declarations to register for most implicit broadcasts – device-wide events not targeted at a specific app. Android O also makes Notifications more manageable by introducing notification channels – app-defined categories to sort notification content. Users can control these channels individually, making notifications less of a downpour-or-drought model. Filling out forms with credit card numbers and other personal information should be easier in Android O, thanks to the Autofill Framework. Standard application views will work with Autofill automatically. Custom views can use the autofill API to specify metadata that's exposed to the Autofill Framework. Other improvements include: Fonts in XML, which lets developers bundle fonts as application resources. Picture-in-Picture Display, which lets users continue watching videos while using other applications. Adaptive icons, which shift shape based on a device-specific mask. Support for wide gamut images. There's support for the LDAC codec (high-quality Bluetooth audio) and Wi-Fi Aware. The Telecom framework extends the ConnectionService APIs to make the integration of third-party calling apps work better. What's more, there's a new native API called Audio for high-performance, low-latency audio, a longstanding issue among game developers. WebView makes multiprocess mode, introduced in Nougat, the default and adds an API for error and crash handling. It also can run URLs through Google's Safe Browsing API. Also, Android is gaining support for Java 8 language APIs and the Android Runtime has been improved, with 2x performance gains in some benchmarks. The Android O developer site has more details. Google is soliciting feedback from developers, so now's the time to test things out if you don't mind unstable software. ® Tips and corrections 41 Comments More from The Register Google briefly broke 'Droid Pay with last week's Android update Which is why lucky Nexus owners have had two OS updates in a week 6 Comments Google borks Nexus 6 with screwy over-the-air Android 7.0 downgrade A meltdown week for the Chocolate Factory 6 Comments Google gets smooth early Android releases.

Combining this powerful, immersive video footage with compelling, authentic stories creates an augmented reality experience that is a pretty potent recipe for driving visitation.” Shirley Bond, Minister of Jobs, Tourism and Skills Training and Minister Responsible for Labour „The Google Trekker project and BC Journeys platform will give people across the world a first-hand look at BC’s beautiful terrain. We are seeing a record number of international visitors and we are widely recognized as a technology and creative industries hub. I’m sure even more people will be drawn to our province once they see these new state-of-the-art virtual recordings from Google and Destination BC.” Nicole Bell, Google Street View Trekker Expert „We’re incredibly proud to partner with Destination BC in this Trekker project. We’ve worked together for years to bring the world to British Columbia and bring British Columbia to the world. These new Street View images, especially some of the more remote locations in BC, are an important part of Google’s goal to create the world’s most comprehensive, accurate and usable map. More than one billion people around the world use Google Maps every month, and we are thrilled to share some of British Columbia’s iconic landscapes.” Links: *See backgrounder below for more detail* About Destination BC: Destination BC is an industry-led Crown corporation that works collaboratively with tourism stakeholders across the province to coordinate marketing at the international, provincial, regional and local levels. For more information about Destination BC’s programs and services, please visit: www.DestinationBC.ca BACKGROUNDER Using Google Street View, British Columbians and people from around the globe can now virtually hike in some of the province’s vast wilderness and be inspired by the powerful nature they see around them. British Columbia joins a select group of bucket-list Google Street View Trekker destinations such as the Pyramids of Giza, the Grand Canyon and the Galapagos Islands. Destination BC team members were trained by Google to use the specialized Street View Trekker equipment. The Trekker weighs approximately 18 kilograms (40 pounds), and is the size of a large hiking backpack. It’s about 1.5 metres (4 feet) in height when set on the ground, and when worn, the camera system extends 60 centimetres (2 feet) above the operator’s shoulders. In addition to the Google Street View Trekker footage, Destination BC captured more than 40 interviews and narratives, drone footage, 40 terabytes of high-definition video footage, hundreds of high resolution images, 24 immersive 360° videos, and chronicled the work of more than 50 tourism businesses. These multimedia assets will be distributed to potential travellers in key markets through Destination BC’s marketing campaigns. There are currently 176 new BC Google Street View Treks now featured on Google Maps, with 14 more to be uploaded by Google. Here is a sample of the Treks: Find treks in British Columbia by reviewing the BC Journeys platform, or through Google Maps, by searching for BC’s Google Street View Treks. (A list of all hikes can be found here: http://www.destinationbc.ca/Marketing/Consumer-Marketing/2017-North-America-Marketing-Initiatives.aspx) Here’s how you can see BC’s Street View Treks: Search for a place in Google Maps. Drag the yellow ‚Pegman’ to a place on the map. The blue areas on the map show where Google has collected ‚Street View’ content. To move around, hover your cursor in the direction you want to go.

Ramlee today with a “Doodle” on its home page here, celebrating what would be his 88th birthday. The multi-talented actor and director was born in Penang in 1929 before passing away a few months after he turned 44 in Kuala Lumpur. “Born 88 years ago today, P. Ramlee’s artistic achievements left a permanent mark on the cultural history of Malaysia. P. Ramlee was a prolific actor, director, writer, and musician who contributed to more than 60 films and composed around 250 songs. “After his death in 1973, Malaysians kept his legacy alive, honoring him with posthumous awards and naming halls, museums, and other buildings after him,” Google explained its decision on its Doodle website. The Doodle captured him during his prime, as explained by Google. Google said the final design was a combination of the two, since the team liked them so much.“Today’s Doodle highlights the Malaysian legend’s diverse artistry and shows him as people best remember him — sporting a thin mustache and a checkered suit, his head cocked slightly to the side,” the tech giant added. The site also the two concept drawings for the Doodle with two different poses. Google said the final design was a combination of the two, since the team liked them so much.

Ramlee was born Teuku Zakaria Teuku Nyak Putih, and began his acting career in Singapore in 1948, before later moving to work in Malaysian since 1964 until his untimely death. He was best remembered acting and directing in evergreen comedy and drama films such as the Bujang Lapok series, Ibu Mertuaku, Anak-Ku Sazali, Madu Tiga, and Nujum Pak Belalang. The Malaysian icon passed away from heart attack, and despite his success, was said to have died penniless.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Palace confirms receipt of memo from NGO about Customs D-G Former Sabah top cop’s jail term for raping, sodomising teen halved upon appeal You are not our appointed moral guardian, Nazri tells Censorship Board Bank Negara: Country’s top 20 earners hold largest share of debt MCA: Cabinet never discussed BN’s plan to take over RUU355 Internet users defend SPM ace attacked over make-up Pay taxes but leave Malaysia’s future to us, Isma tells ‘immigrant’ citizens MCA: Cabinet never discussed BN’s plan to take over RUU355 You are not our appointed moral guardian, Nazri tells Censorship Board Kelantan declares state disaster as bird flu outbreak spreads Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Ninja Joe’s ‘P Ramly’ burger broke halal food law, Jais says Google celebrates 18th birthday with new doodle Google doodle celebrates birthday of Malayan heroine Sybil Kathigasu Seni P.

Still: YouTube According to a blog post by Philipp Schindler, the company's chief business officer, the changes will make it easier for advertisers to exclude content they don't want their ads anywhere near. They will also be able to exclude content across all their ad campaigns, and certain content will be excluded by default. Google, for its part, says it will take greater steps to remove ads from "content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories". The changes will happen globally, and they will apply to both YouTube and Google's larger ad network. The move comes in response to a sizeable protest in the UK and Europe. Last week, the Times of London published an investigation showing that ads for brands like L'Oreal and government agencies like Transport for London had appeared alongside offensive YouTube videos, such as those posted by David Duke or the far-right group Britain First. Dozens of companies, whole advertising networks, and the UK government itself pulled ads from Google in response. The company was summoned to the Cabinet Office, the agency that supports the Prime Minister and her Cabinet, to explain itself. A UK Parliament select committee wrote to Google to ask it to change its policies, saying it was "profiting from hatred" by displaying ads next to offensive videos. The changes will broaden what's excluded by default and expand what's considered offensive — beyond inciting or promoting violence to include broader forms of discrimination. That could include individuals being discriminated against for their beliefs, or their socio-economic background. The company is also looking to improve automated tools to flag objectionable content more quickly, and hiring "significant numbers of people" to increase their reviewing capacity, according to the blog post. These changes are significant for Google, not least because advertising dollars are their main source of revenue, and it is a massive source indeed. Alphabet, Google's parent company, reported quarterly ad revenue of $US22 billion ($29 billion) in the last quarter of 2016. That said, this isn't the first time Google has faced pressure to change its advertising policies: Last year, after "fake news" suddenly became a thing, Google said it was working to remove ads promoting fake news sites from its search results. According to an internet analyst consulted by the Guardian, hate figures like white nationalist David Duke have made thousands of dollars from YouTube ads, though Google disputed that analysis. The concern from the advertisers' point of view, and therefore Google's, is less about racists making money and more their own "brand safety" — essentially, fears that their brand will be damaged by appearing next to offensive videos. Leveraging brands' individual concerns has also been the tactic of Sleeping Giants, a campaign to pressure companies not to advertise on Breitbart. However, several questions remain, especially about exactly what kind of content will be excluded by default — exactly how hateful does it have to be? Will Breitbart be excluded? What about Infowars? If that happens, should we expect (dumb, wrongheaded, annoying) cries that Google is harming free speech, or even an alt-right counter-campaign, as when Breitbart lost its head at Kellogg's after it pulled ads from the site? Google didn't go into specifics, but noted that the new default setting will be more conservative than its current iteration. Given Google's heavy reliance on advertising revenue, and the astounding amount of money it makes off it, perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that the threat of so many huge brands withdrawing it prompted a response — although this is the second time in as many days Google has had to respond to widespread criticism of a policy. Pressure, it seems, works. [Guardian] Comments nope @masterc82 Mar 22, 2017, 3:16pm ughh another story about little babies crying that someone is being mean and forcing a company to pander to their sensitivities. Reply 0 deathduck @deathduck Mar 22, 2017, 3:29pm I kinda feel like racist videos shouldn't be stopped from monetising themselves. I mean, if a specific company ticks the box on the form because they feel that their core demographic is blatant racists, then they should be able to advertise to them directly through relevant videos. The content owner should get a cut of that if they're driving customers to that company. The benefit of this, of course, is that only companies who wish to explicitly be linked to those views will be linked to them. Personally I'd love for there to be a nice, easy way to view which companies wish to support this kind of behaviour. It'd make selecting brands much easier if I knew that one of the two companies I'm considering purchasing from supported racial discrimination and another didn't. Reply 1 g-man @g-man Mar 22, 2017, 4:40pm The advertisers have every right to choose what they are associated with. I see this as a completely ok move by Google.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 22 March 2017 | MYT 8:00 AM Hacked websites on the rise: Google No stopping them: Hacking behaviour is constantly evolving, said Google. — AFP Relaxnews Google painted a bleak picture of cybersecurity trends Monday, saying the number of websites hacked rose 32% last year, with little relief in sight. "We don't expect this trend to slow down. As hackers get more aggressive and more sites become outdated, hackers will continue to capitalise by infecting more sites," Google said in a post on its webmaster blog. Google, which inserts security warnings when it detects hacked sites, said most of those warned can clean up their pages, but that 61% are not notified because their sites are not verified by the search engine. "As always, it's best to take a preventative approach and secure your site rather than dealing with the aftermath," the blog said. "Remember a chain is only as strong as its weakest link." The news comes amid growing concerns over cybersecurity in the wake of massive hacks affecting Yahoo, the US government and major e-commerce firms. Google said certain website hacks often follow similar patterns – some insert "gibberish" on a page, while others create Japanese text that links to fake brand merchandise sites. "Hacking behaviour is constantly evolving, and research allows us to stay up to date on and combat the latest trends," Google said. —  AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Three ways to protect social media accounts from pirates and hackers Geely pulls out of buying Malaysia’s Proton, as its profits surge by 126% Maybank and CIMB to enable Alipay mobile wallet in Malaysia Doctors no different from soldiers Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

Today, the search giant released a developer-only preview of Android O (it’s the working title). While it won’t release for public consumption before the fall, developers can download Android O and begin testing it right away. Android O adds many of the same features Apple customers have enjoyed for more than six months with iOS 10, or even longer. These include things such as richer notifications, picture-in-picture modes, wide color gamuts in apps, limits on what apps can do in the background to improve battery life and more. Here’s our preview of Android O’s enhancements and new capabilities available to customers and developers. Here’s a quick recap of the major new features and enhancements in Android O. Notifications Notifications can now be snoozed so they appear at a later time, just like you do with email. Apps can remove or update a snoozed alert without causing it to reappear. More importantly, Android O lets you batch notifications into topic-based groups, known as channels. For instance, a messaging app could set up separate notification channels for each conversation group created by the user. All notifications in a channel behave the same. You can block or change the behavior of each channel individually at any time and adjust characteristics such as importance, sound, lights, vibration and whether or not the channel is shown on the Lock screen or overrides Do Not Disturb mode. Apps can set a timeout after which the system should cancel a notification. Apps can also tell if a notification was dismissed by the user or removed by an app. Notifications can have differently colored backgrounds so that notifications related to driving directions or a phone call in progress are easier to distinguish. Alerts from messaging apps show more content when collapsed and historic messages can appear in IM-related notifications (like Messages alerts on iOS 10). Android O brings a consistent interface for managing notifications in Settings or by long-pressing a notification to adjust its features inline, which is great. New visuals and notification grouping should help distinguish what’s going on when you have an incoming message or are glancing at the notification shade. Google’s always led the pack with robust implementation of notifications and Android O is no exception. Apple should be wise to borrow some of Android O’s notification improvements in iOS 11. Picture in Picture Picture in picture (PiP) video modes debuted in Android TV. With Android O, PiP comes to phones and tablets. You can do things like continue watching a video in a floating overlay while answering a chat or hailing a car. User-selectable aspect ratio and a set of custom interactions (such as play/pause controls) lets you customize the PiP window to your liking. Furthermore, apps can put themselves in PiP mode from the resumed or a pausing state. Better battery life In an effort to maximize power performance, Android O imposes additional automatic limits on background activity, helping boost the device’s interactive performance and reduce network activity in order to improve battery life. To achieve this, the system puts additional automatic limits on what apps can do in the background (unless interacted with) in terms of implicit broadcasts, background services and location updates. Billed as “a significant change in Android”, this particular system-level improvement should result in apps with minimal impact on battery life. “As a starting point, we’re allowing background apps to receive location updates only a few times each hour,” Google explains. “We’re continuing to tune the location update interval throughout the preview based on system impact and feedback from developers”. Adaptive app icons Android O lets apps specify so-called adaptive launcher icons, which change their look and shape depending on what Home screen theme the user has opted for. In a nutshell, adaptive icons can display a variety of shapes across different device models. The system displays adaptive icons in different shapes and animates interactions with them. The new launcher icons are also used in shortcuts, the Settings app, sharing dialogs and the overview screen. Adaptive icons are defined using two layers and a mask. Each device manufacturer is required to provide a mask used by the system to render all icons with the same shape. Adaptive icons support a variety of visual effects like the parallax effect on Apple TV icons, as you’re seeing below. Apple doesn’t support adaptive icons, but iOS 10.3 will let apps change their Home screen icon without requiring a new binary from App Store. Miscellaneous Android O brings integrated support for picture in picture video modes from Android TV, a feature Apple’s supported since iOS 9 (but only on newer iPads, for now). Third-party apps can display wide gamut images on new devices that have a wide-gamut color capable display, yet another feature Apple’s had since iOS 10. Core OS Various platform enhancements in Android O include new APIs for autofillers, multi-processes, low-latency audio and system-level integration with VoIP apps (like on iOS 10). Google Safe Browsing is now supported across web views in apps. Android O also brings support for Wi-Fi Aware (previously known as Neighbor Awareness Networking). With Wi-Fi Aware, devices with the appropriate hardware can communicate over Wi-Fi without an Internet access point (something like AirDrop). “We’re working with our hardware partners to bring Wi-Fi Aware technology to devices as soon as possible,” says Google. High-quality Bluetooth audio codecs like Sony’s LDAC have been adopted as well. Apps can now use fonts in XML layouts and define font families in XML because fonts are now a fully supported resource type in Android O. Activities can now be launch on a remote display thanks to multi-display support. Android O will give users the ability to select an autofill app just like they can choose a keyboard app. By adding platform support for autofill, Google has made it easier for users to securely store their data like addresses, user names and even passwords in their favorite password manager and use it for autofill system-wide. The Android Runtime is faster than ever before thanks to Java 8 language APIs and runtime optimizations, with improvements of up to 2x on some app benchmarks. Arrow and tab-based keyboard navigation is now a reality. “With the advent of Google Play apps on Chrome OS and other large form factors, we’re seeing a resurgence of keyboard navigation use within apps,” said the firm. Aside from these user-facing improvements, Android O brings a whole bunch of new capabilities aimed at making the operating system more secure while being easier to deploy and manage in corporate environments. Google says that “there are more features coming” to Android O. It remains to be seen if the search company releases a public beta of Android O that regular people could test-drive anytime soon. If you ask us, Android O’s public beta will drop at Google I/O, which takes place May 17–19 at the outdoor Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California.

IOS changed for the better since the first release and Android is borrowing a lot more from IOS than IOS from Android. Android also became more closed while IOS opened up. You can’t do anything to any of Google’s services, but you get the API’s for IOS apps now. Diego Milano Let’s face it— Google has done a much better job with Android from a GUI design standpoint over the years than Apple. If you don’t agree, just look at iOS 10’s notification banners and see for yourself— they are LAUGHABLE to say the least and I can’t wait for a jailbreak tweak to rid me of them for good. Hopefully iOS 11 will improve this.

The technology firm also confirmed that it has reached its target early, and has set itself to train even more Africans in digital skills in the coming year. Digital tutorials The Digital Skills programme offers 89 courses through the online portal, and Google works with 14 training partners covering more than 20 countries to offer face to face training. The programme is expected to address needs for small business owners, who are looking to better understand how to take advantage of the web across Africa. Accordingly, Google will add web-focused skills training for SMEs across Africa as part of this initiative. In addition to the new target, Google is extending its commitment to the Digital Skills programme by assisting local communities further in several ways including provision of offline versions of its online training materials to reach individuals and businesses in low access areas where it is unable to hold physical training sessions. Additionally, Google would provide offline versions of the content in languages like Hausa, Swahili and IsiZulu. Speaking on the new development, Google Nigeria country manager Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor, in a press conference in Lagos last week, said that the web is a driver of economic growth, transforming society as a whole. “People must be equipped, through training and reskilling to make use of the tools, and take advantage of it for entrepreneurship, employment and e-inclusion. Our goal with this and previous web training initiatives is to enable more people across the continent better understand how to leverage the Web tools for growth – to give them access to better employment and/or the skills to start their own businesses.”   Urowayino Warami View all posts by Urowayino Warami → Previous Post Tecno brings PhonePad 3 Phablet to Nigeria Next Post NIPOST resurrects, wears five new hats Disclaimer Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Google Officially Announces Android O By Tyler Lee on 03/21/2017 16:55 PDT If you were hoping that Google would officially announce the next major build of Android at Google I/O in May, you will actually be pleased to learn that Google has actually announced it much earlier. In an announcement on the Android Developer Blog, Google has made the next major Android build official in the form of Android O. Now what the “O” stands for is still anyone’s guess, and as for the version number, we can only assume it will be Android 8.0, at least for now but we’ll keep our eyes peeled anyway. Naturally with every major Android build, Google introduces a bunch of new features and improvements that they’ll be making to its mobile OS, and Android O is no different. According to Google, some of the new features and improvements users can expect would be to battery life, where there will be automatic limits on what apps can do in the background. There are also new notification channels where users can choose what notifications they want to see. There are new autofill APIs, picture-in-picture for handsets and new windowing features, adaptive icons, support for high quality Bluetooth audio codecs, and more. The best part is that the developer preview of Android O is already available for developers to download and check out. Regular users can probably do the same but given that we don’t expect Android O to be released anytime soon, what you see here is probably a very early build and probably shouldn’t be used as your daily driver, but if you’re interested then head on over to Google’s website for the details.

Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and chairman of the home affairs select committee, said that National Action videos were still available on YouTube, which is owned by Google. Robert Buckland, the Solicitor-General, said that Google could be breaking the law if it is found to have been “reckless” in allowing the material to remain online. Under the Terrorism Act 2006 it is an offence to disseminate terrorist material either “intentionally” or “recklessly”. Solicitor General Robert Buckland answered questions from MPs  Credit: John Stillwell /PA Mr Buckland told MPs: “I think I would have to be careful because one would need to look at the evidence in a particular instance. “But I made my point, I think the law is there, it’s a clear boundary and, frankly, if this behaviour meets the criteria for recklessness, then it potentially could lead to an investigation. It would be wrong of me to come to a firm conclusion without more information but I hope I have made the point as clear as I can that the criminal law is there and will be used if appropriate.” Google declined to comment on what was said in the committee. Peter Barron of Google has appeared before the committee Credit: PA Last week, Peter Barron, of Google, told the committee that the sheer volume of material uploaded to YouTube made it difficult to police but that the company took action when content was flagged. “We have 400 hours of video uploaded on to YouTube every minute which is an extraordinary amount of content,” he said on March 14. “Clearly, we don’t want illegal content on our platforms and when flagged to us we remove that as quickly as we possibly can.” Google has promised a “tougher stance” on hateful content as it announced changes to its advertising policy following an outcry and boycotts from advertisers over their content appearing alongside extreme material. Companies that have withdrawn advertising from Google Marks & Spencer, the BBC and the Government were among the organisations to suspend their advertising on YouTube after it emerged ads had in some cases appeared on videos posted to the site by extremist groups. The technology company apologised and said it would review its advertising policies and systems. The firm’s chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, said it was already bringing in changes. “Starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content,” he said. “This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. This change will enable us to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites.” The internet giant was criticised by MPs for not doing enough to combat the spread of hate-filled videos on the site, with Ms Cooper telling the firm it can afford to do “far more, far faster” to remove such content.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 22 March 2017 | MYT 7:01 AM Google and sister company offer free cyber security to election groups - M'sia among those attacked Such attacks have targeted not only political parties, but also election monitors and independent news organisations in Myanmar (2010), Malaysia (2013), Ecuador (2015), Mexico (2015-2016), Montenegro (2016) and the Netherlands (2017). The growing frequency of politically-motivated online attacks -- from the recent hacking of Twitter accounts by Turkish nationalists to the U.S. Democratic Party's email breach -- has left governments and pro-democracy groups scrambling for ways to thwart hackers and the rising tide of "fake" news. FRANKFURT/AMSTERDAM: Google and sister company Jigsaw are joining forces to defend election organisers and civic groups against cyber attacks free of charge as the broader tech industry seeks to fend off criticism that it is not doing enough to stop online efforts to distort elections. Such attacks have targeted not only political parties, but also election monitors and independent news organisations in Myanmar (2010), Malaysia (2013), Ecuador (2015), Mexico (2015-2016), Montenegro (2016) and the Netherlands (2017). The growing frequency of politically-motivated online attacks -- from the recent hacking of Twitter accounts by Turkish nationalists to the U.S. Democratic Party's email breach -- has left governments and pro-democracy groups scrambling for ways to thwart hackers and the rising tide of "fake" news. Alphabet Inc subsidiaries Jigsaw and Google are offering a free Protect Your Election package to low-budget organisations. The service to ward off website attacks has already been offered to news organisations for the past year under what is known as Project Shield. Last week Jigsaw, which develops security tools for civic groups, joined up with Google to defend a voter information website that came under cyber attack during the Dutch national election. The KiesKompas and Stemwijzer websites -- used by about half of Dutch voters to see which parties best match their political views -- were knocked out by a deluge of web traffic on March 14, which spilled over into election day. "The attack was not child’s play: it was very sophisticated because the attackers kept trying different avenues of attack again and again," said KiesKompas director Willem Blanken. KiesKompas, which rougly translates as ChoiceCompass, enlisted the help of Jigsaw on the evening of March 14, while Stemwijzer, or VoteGuide, signed up NBIP, a non-profit group set up by about 100 Dutch internet and telecoms providers. The election guide services remained out of action on the morning of the vote, but both were successfully restored to service around midday. FAKE NEWS, EXTREMISM The rise of Google and tech rival Facebook was welcomed as a gift to democracy and free speech against autocratic governments. More recently, however, there has been a growing backlash against fake news on social media, which has polarised political debate, and the failure to stop extremist groups using their networks to spread propaganda and find new recruits. Google vowed on Tuesday to police its websites better by ramping up staff numbers and overhauling its policies after several companies deserted the internet giant for failing to keep their adverts off hate-filled videos. A spokesman for Jigsaw said on Tuesday that it plans to offer the Protect Your Election suite free to individuals and organisations involved in forthcoming national votes in France, South Korea and Germany and subsequent elections as they occur. Jigsaw is funded by Alphabet and remains autonomous from Google, though the sister companies work together on larger-scale projects. Project Shield defends against so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that have plagued the web since about 2000 and which government and commercial experts say have intensified over the past year. Such attacks have targeted not only political parties, but also election monitors and independent news organisations in Myanmar (2010), Malaysia (2013), Ecuador (2015), Mexico (2015-2016), Montenegro (2016) and the Netherlands (2017). Hundreds of companies compete to protect websites from intruders, including Clouldflare, Akamai and Imperva Incapsula. Basic measures are often free and more robust safeguards can cost hundreds of dollars a month. However, sustained high-volume attacks at decisive moments during elections can quickly run up thousands of dollars in bills -- a big stretch for civic groups with minimal funding.     BASELINE PROTECTION In addition to Project Shield, Jigsaw is offering Password Alert to ward off attempts to steal Google passwords and Two-Step Verification for an added layer of protection on web and mobile accounts as part of its Protect Your Election toolkit. News websites, human rights websites and election monitoring and information websites are eligible to apply for DDoS protection, the Jigsaw spokesman said. Candidates and campaigns are eligible for the two-password protection tools, but not the free DDoS protection. More details can be found at: https://g.co/protectyourelection  This starter set of security tools offer baseline protection but can only go so far in thwarting the dizzying array of political shenanigans that now play out in cyberspace. They could do little, for example, to ward off the hijacking of high-profile Twitter accounts by a Turkish nationalist hacker group that took place as the Dutch voted last week and attracted widespread media attention. These attacks involved hacking into an Amsterdam-based social media analytics company to post anti-Dutch and anti-German messages amid a diplomatic spat with Turkey. Officials at the Dutch election guides said that web traffic on their sites appeared to come from various nations but the identity of the attackers remains a mystery. Several of the officials denied a De Telegraaf report that Turkey was behind the attacks. "There’s just nothing to substantiate that. We simply don’t know," KiesKompas director Blanken said. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Technology , Corporate News , Foreign News , Investing Related Stories You May Be Interested Three ways to protect social media accounts from pirates and hackers Geely pulls out of buying Malaysia’s Proton, as its profits surge by 126% Maybank and CIMB to enable Alipay mobile wallet in Malaysia Doctors no different from soldiers Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

It was briefly touched on in Google’s original Android O announcement post, but the folks at The Verge were able to get a few extra details about Sony and Google’s partnership and what it means for Bluetooth audio on Android. According to Google, Sony Mobile “contributed more than 30 feature enhancements and 250 bug fixes” in Android O, with a big focus being high-res audio over Bluetooth thanks to the addition of their LDAC wireless audio coding technology. LDAC allow for much higher bitrates to be transferred over Bluetooth — up to 990kbps — translating into drastically improved audio fidelity when using compatible wireless headphones. And there-in lies the biggest caveat to Sony’s contribution — you’ll need to invest in a pair of Sony’s high-end wireless headphones or speakers if you’re looking to take full advantage of LDAC. It’s worth noting that LDAC is already built into Sony Xperia devices, but by bringing this tech to Android proper, smartphone makers will soon be able to take advantage of Sony’s technology in their own handsets running Android O. With more OEMs dropping the 3.5mm jack, this could give accessory manufacturers extra incentive to license LDAC from Sony, something we’re sure Sony is hoping to achieve from their generous contribution. local_offer    Android O   Sony LDAC   Sony Xperia   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (8) stars Further Reading Android O Hands-on Android O has a new Ambient Display lockscreen [VIDEO] Android O snooze notifications How Android O saves battery How to install Android O Dev Preview stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertFunny video shows frustrations with Google Home closeThis video perfectly shows why you shouldn’t waste your money on Google Home Google Home has been out for a little over 6 months now, but it seems the product is still a bit half-baked.

On a desktop computer monitor, the wallpaper doesn’t look all that great, but once you’ve applied it on a phone, it looks pretty fantastic, especially on an AMOLED panel. I still love the Earth live wallpaper from the Google Pixel a bit more than this, but this is easily one of my favorite wallpapers in recent memory. The full wallpaper is embedded below, but just in case it gets compressed at all, here’s an Imgur download.

The gigabit internet service is offering refunds to hundreds of customers who put down deposits in Fiber’s first market, with the Alphabet division reportedly being more careful in regards to rollout. According to Bloomberg, several hundred people are affected by Google reneging on Fiber deployment in areas where residents had already placed deposits. The company began emailing residents over the past week about refunds, noting that they are “unable to build our network to connect your home or business at this time.” Despite this particular setback, Fiber is still very much expanding coverage in existing markets like Raleigh in North Carolina, as well as Kansas City. Particularly, a spokesperson noted, “We recently announced our expansion into Raymore, we are continuing to build in Overland Park, and we can’t wait for even more customers in Kansas City to experience what’s possible with Google Fiber.” Bloomberg suggests that Google Fiber is now “more careful” when taking deposits, with the company only providing service to areas that it can connect in the coming quarters. This streamlining comes as Google Fiber lost its CEO last year, while pausing deployment in several future cities. Meanwhile, deployment in San Antonio, Texas was paused in late January over local complaints to key infrastructure placements.

Apparently, Google didn’t decide what Android O would be on its own, with some Android partners contributing bits and pieces, including Sony… The best gifts for Android users According to Google (via The Verge), Sony has so far contributed to more than 30 feature enhancements on Android O, and over 250 bug fixes as well. Among the long list of things included in Android O is better support for Bluetooth audio, allowing for better streaming quality on various smartphones. Apparently, Sony played a big role in this department, as the company’s assistance helps Android become a platform more well suited to high-res audio. Android O will support Sony’s LDAC wireless audio coding tech which can transfer more data compared to Bluetooth on your standard smartphone. LDAC can apparently get a bitrate up to 990kbps compared to standard wireless audio coding which falls around 330kbps. In layman’s terms, this will allow audio to be transmitted closer to its original quality. Sony already packs this tech in its Android phones, but since it’s now a part of Android O natively, it means that any OEM will be able to use it with compatible audio devices. Obviously, this isn’t a change that will affect everyone as most Bluetooth speakers don’t support LDAC, but for anyone who is into audio and is willing to check out LDAC compatible products, this opens up a lot more phones in the Android ecosystem… Ben Schoon @NexusBen Ben is a writer for 9to5Google who can also be found over on the 9to5Google YouTube channel and on Twitter @NexusBen.

While Google’s latest Android Nougat update is still slowly arriving for most, some are ready for what’s next. After rumors earlier this month it’s now available for select few as a very limited early developer preview, or beta. Here’s what’s new, where to get it right now and everything you need to know. The annual Google I/O developer event is coming up quick, and Android O will likely take center stage. Over the past few years Google’s used their even to showcase new versions of Android, and we can expect the same this year. Android O will be approaching the second beta release by then. Read: Google Pixel XL Review: A New Breed of Android Last year Android N was announced and released as a limited preview in March. Ahead of Google I/O. Just as expected, the same thing has happened for Android O. It comes with some neat new changes to icons, notifications, battery life and much more. Read on for the current changelog, what’s new and how to get it right now. After rumors earlier this week Google has made it official. Android O is here, albeit a very early preview that isn’t for daily use. We know the next version of Android will be called Android O at first, then later get a name. Google names each version in alphabetical order and after tasty treats. Like Android 4.4 KitKat, Android 5.0 Lollipop, Marshmallow, and now Android 7.0 Nougat. Next is Android O, and some Google employees have even started teasing it will be called Oreo. We’ll have to wait and see. That isn’t important though. It’s the changes, improvements and new features most will likely appreciate. I’m looking forward to Android 9.0 Pistachio, or Peanut Brittle. Android O Developer Preview Available First things first, when can you get Android O? Well, right now apparently. As long as you have the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Google Pixel, Pixel XL or Pixel C tablet. Older devices are no longer allowed in the beta. As usual Google is allowing developers or those daring enough to try, the option to get it today. Simply click below to get started. Download Android O (click here) Google notes (more so than usual) that this is an extremely early first version preview, and not stable enough for daily use. There are bugs, issues, and battery life could be worse. Even though the final version of Android O will severely improve battery life with a new restrictive app mode. Those with eligible devices can download the factory images and flash the Android O Developer Preview starting today. However, it is not a part of the current Android Beta program, so over the air updates won’t be possible. At least not yet. Meaning anyone interested will need to completely wipe out their device, and start fresh with O. What’s New in Android O Considering this is a very early developer preview, and not anywhere near the final release, nothing is final. Similar to 2016 with Android N things are subject to change, evolve, or be removed completely by the time it’s actually released to the public. That being said, here are some of the changes we’re seeing already. Background Limits: A power saving feature in addition to “Doze” that will restrict app battery usage while in the background based on priority. (Some apps may need to reload when you re-open them) More info here. Auto-Fill: Just like how our web browsers on desktops and mobile auto-fill information like email or physical addresses, we will now be able to do this in apps. Android O brings auto-fill in a more advanced method to the entire OS. Adaptive Icons & Badges: At-a-glance notification number bubbles or information right on home screen app icon badges. Similar to iOS. Not to mention adaptive icons. Imagine the clock icon always showing the right time, calendar showing the date, etc. Not to mention neat animations. Notification Channels: Our notification system is changing a little bit again, for the better. Bundled notifications thanks to a new API will let developers have more control of how and what we get from notifications. Not to mention grouped notifications, and a smarter order in which they’re displayed. We could see cross-device sync later too. More details here. Picture-in-Picture Mode: Android TV has PIP mode with Nougat, and now all Android will have it with Android O. This is picture-in-picture video. Imagine watching Netflix and YouTube at the same time. Yes please. There is also support for multi-displays. So watch something on a phone and cast another stream at the same time. Wide-gamut color for apps: Android developers can now take advantage of new devices that have a wide-gamut color capable display. Like the Galaxy S8. Apps will be more colorful and amazing. Keyboard Navigation: We already have this to some extent in Android Nougat, and it will be better in O. Audio Improvements: New low-latency audio, Bluetooth aptX, and other things. And Much More This is just a small list of some of the highlight changes coming with Android O. Although we can expect a lot more in the near future. There are also Java 8 APIs, improvements to webview, WiFi NAN, telephone framework tweaks, and other things. Stay tuned for more details. This is all just developing. Android O Feature Rumors More Google Assistant: Now that the Google Assistant works with all new Android devices, expect tons of new smart features and controls. Smart Text Selection: Also being called “Copy Less” where text selection for copy/paste, addresses, phone numbers and more can be saved and moved by the Google Assistant automatically. Or just be better than the current copy/paste method. (Could be coming in a second beta release) Gestures & Moves: Many devices have gestures, and the Google Pixel has “Moves”. Like swiping down on the fingerprint scanner to pull down the notification bar. Or drawing a C in the screen to instantly launch the camera. More Coming Soon Android O Release Date & Updates So when will Android O be released? Well, that’s anyone’s guess at this point. Last year Google unveiled N in March as a developer preview, and it wasn’t officially released until late August. According to the official announcement today there will be four Android O developer preview betas released. Preview 2 will arrive in late May (around Google IO) then we can expect a third release in June. Then likely the final and fourth sometime in August before the global and official release date for all. That should be in Q3 according to Google. That all said, Google I/O will take place this year on May 17th until May 19th. Giving developers and Android users three days worth of information. We may not see or hear anything further on Android O until the second beta is released during or right before Google IO. Expect more features and other changes at that time. Keep in mind though, this is only a beta for select developers and early adopters. The global release for all devices and manufacturers won’t be until later in the year. Google said Q3, but it will likely be around September. Then companies like Samsung will start working on updates, which will probably arrive sometime in early 2018. As soon as we know more we’ll update with all of the details. While you’re here see what changed with Android N, then compare to some of the changes mentioned above with Android O. Read: Android Nougat vs Android 6.0 Marshmallow Walkthrough: What’s New What Devices Will Get Android O? Any device released within the past two years or so should technically be capable of getting the update to Android O when it’s released. Manufacturers are required to support a device for at least 18-months from the day it’s released to the public. So like the Galaxy S6, up to the most recent LG G6. However, which devices will get it first is important. Google does what’s called a Developer Preview, or a beta where millions get early access. For now it’s limited to the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel, Pixel XL and Pixel C tablet. No Nexus 5 or Nexus 5, as this is the end of the line for them. They will probably stay on Nougat, but still receive security patches. Additionally, most other device owners will need to wait for betas from those companies, or the global release date later this year. Final Thoughts In closing, this is all we know thus far. Google literally just announce the Android O beta, and things will change a lot in the coming months. Some of the features in the beta may not be in the final release, and others will change. We saw this last year, and expect it again. However, it’s nice to know we can expect three updates to Android O, and four developer preview betas in total. Then, sometime later this year the new operating system will be ready for a global release for any and all smartphones. Expect it to launch on the new Google Pixel 2, or something like the LG V30.

Name: Subject: Message: Here’s how adaptive icons will work with Android O [Diving into Android O] Newsby John Callaham2 days ago 7 816 16 Be sure to check out our Diving into Android O series for more coverage! For the most part, app icons on your smartphone are just that; flat artwork that just sits there on your home screen. With the release of Android O, Google hopes to put some life into those app logos on the display with the introduction of what the company is calling adaptive icons. While this feature isn’t really available to users in the first O developer preview, Google says that this new feature will allow app developers to create icons that will have different shapes for different devices. For example, a Facebook app icon may have a square shape on a Google Pixel XL but a circular (or squircle) shape when it is displayed on a Samsung Galaxy S8. Google says that with Android O, each device can provide a mask for that icon, which the OS can use to render all icons with the same shape. This will likely be embraced by OEMs who would like to have some unique looking home screens and app icons without having to create their own unique UX. Adaptive icons can be used with app shortcuts, inside the Settings app, sharing dialogs and in the overview screen The adaptive icons can be used with app shortcuts, and they can also be set up inside the Settings app, along with sharing dialogs and the overview screen. They can also support a number of visual effects when a person interacts with an icon. In order for this new feature to work, Android O developers must create the launcher icons at 108 x 108 dp for both layers (the foreground and the background). Previous versions of Android supported just one layer for the app icon, and it was smaller at 48 x 48 dp. See also: A closer look at the redesigned Settings menu in Android O 2 days ago In addition to the new animated icons, Android O will also support apps that will be able to take advantage of devices that have a wide-gamut color capable display. Android O apps will need to enable a flag in their manifest and load bitmaps with an embedded wide color profile. Google indicated it will support AdobeRGB, Pro Photo RGB, and DCI-P formats, among others. Finally, the new version of Android will be able to use fonts as a fully supported resource type, which means that app developers will be able to use use fonts in XML layouts, along with the ability to define font families in XML. App developers can find out a lot more about how to use these new font resources on the Android O dev site. All in all, it sounds like the new OS will offer developers a wider variety of UI and icon designs.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Android O Developer Preview : New Features And Enhancements That You Must Know By Zara Ali Mar 21, 2017 12Shares Share Tweet Submit In a rather unexpected move, Google has released the first developer preview for next version of its mobile OS – Android O (v8.0). It is codenamed Android ‘O’, but we are conveniently assuming that the O stands for Oreo. Being the first developer preview, one cannot really expect it to be stable enough. Even Google wrote in the post that “it’s early days, there are more features coming, and there’s still plenty of stabilization and performance work ahead of us. But it’s booting :).” Also, being in the nascent stages of stability, the preview will not be available on Android Beta program, which means no more easy OTA updates for now. Google has posted factory images for the Nexus 5X, 6P, Player, and the Pixel, Pixel XL, and Pixel C. You can find the installation instructions in this post. Related Google Announces Android O with Battery Life & Notifications Updates – Download First Developer Preview Images By the looks of it, we do not really see any path-breaking features or UI changes. It looks like that this time Google has focused more on the core values of the operating system. However, there are still many features that you must know about. We have listed them below. Here are some of the major Android O features Notifications Android O comes with an all new notification channel, which provides the ability to have group notifications from apps. It means that you can now cluster your notifications under a type, for example – sports notifications that will store all the info about sports that comes in the app. It will give wider control to the users to oversee apps and the content that pops up in the notification bar. Picture In Picture (PiP) This feature shall come handy to those who watch a lot of videos on their Android devices. It allows users to put a video into a PiP mode when they want to switch to a new app. The mode is pretty much like what we see on YouTube, it resizes the video window into a small PiP placed at the bottom right corner whenever a user taps on the back button. The videos remain paused in the PiP and the playback starts once the user opens them. Related Google Search App Now Has Nifty Shortcuts For Quick Access To Various Web Apps Keyboard Navigation This feature is aimed at offering better keyboard control to Android apps on Chrome OS. It offers enhanced arrow and tab keyboard navigation within apps. Google said that “with the advent of Android Apps on Chrome OS and other large form factors, we’re seeing a resurgence of keyboard navigation use within Android apps.” Adaptive icons To offer better customization with the UI, Android O allows users to create adaptive icons, which are displayed in different shapes on the screen. There are also corresponding animated actions that kick off when you touch the icons. Advertisement Multi-Display Support It is also aimed at helping developers to carry out activities on Chrome OS. With the multi-display support, developers will be able to use remote display to launch activities. Background Limits This one focuses on reducing the background data usage and increasing battery life. Android O has an assorted control over the app, it can limit the amount of data used by an app in the background, which in turn enhances the battery life. There are three types of limits that will be used by the OS to restrict data consumption – implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates. Wide-Gamut Color for Apps It allows Android developers to make full use of imaging apps on the devices that feature wide-gamut color display. To make use of the feature, developers have to enable a flag in their app’s manifest for every activity. They will also have to upload bitmaps and embedded wide color profile (AdobeRGB, Pro Photo RGB, DCI-P3, etc.). Enhanced Connectivity and Audio Android O comes with high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs – the LDAC codec. It also has new Wi-Fi features such as Wi-Fi Aware formerly known as Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN. On the compatible devices, this feature would be able to communicate without the internet connection. In the blog post, Google said that it is currently working with its hardware partners to make Wi-Fi Aware technology available to devices shortly. In addition, the Telecom framework is bringing ConnectionService APIs to support third party calling apps integrate with System UI, to make it compatible with other apps too. Partner Platform Contributions Hardware and software makers have come together for Android O to make it more reliable and significant. Google states as an example that “Sony has contributed more than 30 feature enhancements including the LDAC codec and 250 bug fixes to Android O.” AAudio API for Pro Audio Android O features AAudio, which is a new native API designed particularly for apps that require high-performance and low-stress audio. The apps associated with AAudio read and write data via streams. In the Developer Preview, Google released an early version of the new AAudio API for Pro Audio feature. Java 8 Language APIs With Android O onboard, Android supports a new java.time API, which makes the runtime faster and 2x improvements in app benchmarks. These were the new features on Android O. Stay tuned with us to get more info on further developments in Android O and revelations regarding its future releases.

Its new feature, called “shortcuts,” will appear as a row of icons below the Google search box. Where now you’d have to ponder and then speak or type a request, the shortcuts will let you tap the icons to get the latest weather, movie show times, sports scores, restaurant recommendations and other common requests. The shortcuts will begin appearing in updates to Google’s app for iPhones, Android phones and its mobile website. The Android app will also include various tools such as a currency converter, a language translator and an ATM locator, which you can also summon with a tap. Those tools may eventually make it to the iPhone as well, although Google says it doesn’t know when. These shortcuts are the latest step in Google’s quest to turn its search engine into a secondary brain that anticipates people’s needs and desires. The search engine gleans these insights by analyzing your past requests and, when you allow it, tracking your location, a practice that periodically raises privacy concerns about Google’s power to create digital profiles of its users. Based on the knowledge that Google already has accumulated, its shortcuts feature may already list your favorite sports teams or recommend nearby restaurants serving cuisines you prefer. Shortcuts also show how Google’s search engine has been adapting to its audience, now that smartphones have become the primary way millions or of people stay connected to the internet. Since more than half of requests for Google’s search engine now come from smartphones, the Mountain View, California, company has adapted its services to smaller screens, touch keyboards and apps instead of websites. Early in that process, Google tweaked its search engine to answer many requests with factual summaries at the top of its results page, a change from simply displaying a list of links to other websites. Voice-recognition technology also allows you to speak your request into a phone instead of typing it. The transition is going well so far. Google’s revenue rose 20 percent last year to USD89 billion, propelled by digital ads served up on its search engine, YouTube and Gmail. Although shortcuts won’t initially show ads after you tap them, Google typically sells marketing space if a feature or service becomes popular.

As first spotted by Ars Technica, the latest Android app version (9.49) shows a new “save your parking option” when you tap on your blue location dot. Tap on this and Google will save your rough location (you can enter the exact location too), and give you the option to write notes, add photos, or even set a timer. That last option is particularly useful if you’re parked at a meter and need to make sure to leave or refill it before you get a ticket. Win a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017! CHECK IT OUT The parking notification will remain in maps until you dismiss it by pressing “clear” and you can also share the parking location if you need to rendezvous with someone. It’s a pretty thorough implementation for a small new feature. The only problem is that the feature is pretty obscure; I didn’t even know I could tap on the blue dot until I read the Ars Technica piece. It would be nice if Google placed the option in the side menu or somewhere a bit more visible. I also see no reason why you couldn’t just add a parking spot to a dropped pin anywhere on the map instead of just your current location (although, again, you can modify the location after you’ve saved the spot). Still, it’s a welcome feature for people who actually drive. No word on when the feature will come to iOS, but we imagine it’s only a matter of time.

Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the disgraced web giant could be guilty of “disseminating” material – breaking criminal law. Alamy 4 Google may have breached Terrorism Act over extremist material The powerful Tory told a cross-party Commons Committee: “I think the legislation is clear. “It is my hope and expectation that these organisations will indeed come to heel and obey the law. But the law is there if necessary.” He added: “It would be wrong of me to come to a firm conclusion without more information. But I hope I have made the point as clear as I can.” Rex Features 4 Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the disgraced web giant could be guilty of ‘disseminating’ material The extraordinary comment the Government’s second most senior legal officer came as MPs accused ministers of letting Google, Facebook and Twitter off the hook when it came to tackling hate crime. Home Affairs Select Committee chair Yvette Cooper said it defied belief that recruitment videos put up by banned far-right group National Action were still on YouTube, bought by Google a decade ago. Home Office Minister Sarah Newton insisted Google had only issued a public apology over placing advertising next to extremist material after being “read the riot act” at a Whitehall summit last week.

Ms Newton said Ministers were studying “very carefully” a German draft law proposing £40 million fines if social media companies fail to take down hate videos within a 24 hour deadline. She added: “We are not leaving anything off the table, they have been read the riot act and they need to step up and explain what they are going to do.” PA:Press Association 4 Yvette Cooper said it defied belief that recruitment videos put up by banned group were still on YouTube But furious MPs said it appeared the Government “lacked teeth” and Google was only beginning to up its game in recent days after seeing a wave of advertisers shelve accounts with the US titan. Google on Monday issued a stunning apology after Volkswagen, Tesco and Toyota joined 250 companies who have suspended deals with the company. An investigation by The Times – the Sun’s sister newspaper – had found the companies promoted next to videos posted by hate preachers, rape apologists and homophobic extremists. Separately yesterday Twitter said it had suspended more than 375,000 accounts for violations linked to the promotion of terrorism during the last six months of 2016. Eyevine 4 Sarah Newton insisted Google had only issued a public apology after being ‘read the riot act’ Last week Google policy chief Peter Barron said the sheer volume of material uploaded to YouTube made it difficult to police. And he admitted Google never proactively searched for terror or paedo content. Ms Cooper said: “The Government banned National Action to stop them recruiting people to terrorist activity. “Yet despite repeated complaints to Google, National Action’s illegal recruitment videos are still available on YouTube. “We heard from the Minister that the Government asked YouTube to remove National Action videos — yet it appears that Google have completely ignored those requests. “If this is true, then it seems that one of the richest companies on the planet is aiding and abetting illegal terrorist recruitment activity, and Ministers need to tell us what action they plan to take.” Google's incredible timelapse video shows decades passing by in seconds The Sun Topics Google Terrorism Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Comments Most Popular Live Blog LONDON TERROR ATTACK London terror attack LIVE – latest news and updates after Parliament stabbing at Westminster News KIM'S MISSILE FLOPS Humiliation for Kim Jong-un as his rocket EXPLODES seconds after launch News STATION STABBING Cops descend on Kennington Tube station after mass brawl and stabbing in south London News 'ARE YOU KIDDING ME?'

Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water… it turns out that more websites were hacked in 2016 than 2015. That's according to Google which reported as part of its #NoHacked campaign that the number of websites hacked increased by 32 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. And the company doesn't expect this trend to slow down as webmasters fail to keep up to date on website security.  Writing on the Webmasters Blog, Wafa Alnasayan, trust and safety analyst and Eric Kuan, webmaster relations, said, “As hackers get more aggressive and more sites become outdated, hackers will continue to capitalise by infecting more sites,” they said. Google includes warnings in search results when it suspects that a website may have been hacked and informs webmasters when possible. The majority of webmasters of hacked websites – 61 percent – don't receive a notification from Google because their sites weren't verified in Google's Search Console. However, of those who do receive a notification, 84 percent are successful in cleaning their sites, indicating that it's not difficult to address the most common attacks. Most attacks are not sophisticated, Google says, and the list of common routes to compromise include compromised passwords, missing security updates, insecure themes and plugins, social engineering and failures of security policy. Google has created new help documentation for those looking to improve their site security or needing to clean up an infection. “Remember a chain is only as strong as its weakest link,” the authors said.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai  at the 2015 Google I/O conference in San Francisco Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images By Patrick Kulp2017-03-21 23:28:38 UTC Google has apologized repeatedly to outraged British brands and government groups that found their ads surfacing on hateful YouTube videos. Now it's finally delivering on its promise to do better. The company announced a host of changes to its advertising systems on Tuesday meant to give brands more control over where their ads appear. SEE ALSO: Google swears ads will stop showing up in the absolute worst places The move comes after the Times of London set off a firestorm with reports that major advertisers were being featured alongside terrorist sympathizers, Nazis and other extremists on YouTube. Several big brands have pulled their ads from the platform in response over the past few days, and Google was called before UK authorities last Friday to explain itself. "We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us," Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler wrote in the blog post announcing the changes. "Starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content." First off, Google will now exclude "potentially objectionable" content by default. Previously, advertisers had to specify if they wanted to play it safe, but now it's the other way around. "Starting today, we're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content" Google will also start allowing advertisers to blacklist individual YouTube channels and sites. The option was only available by "topic" or "category" before now. Beyond that, Google said it would crack down harder on videos that involve harassment on the basis of "race, religion, gender or similar categories" — something it would seem should already be included in the site's blanket ban on hate speech. The company claims it's beefing up the number of staff charged with reviewing advertisements and developing AI tools for detecting violations. The whole ordeal comes amid growing tensions between big platforms like Google and Facebook and the advertisers that buy ad space with them.  Marketers are increasingly fed up with problems like rampant ad fraud, faulty measurements and sketchy placements. Many leading industry figures have recognized that collective action like the UK boycott is the only way to counterweight the duopoly power Google and Facebook have in the online market. We've reached out to several of the brands and agencies that have pulled ads and will update the story with any responses.

Name: Subject: Message: A closer look at the redesigned Settings menu [Diving into Android O] Newsby Jimmy Westenberg2 days ago 27 1369 24 Be sure to check out our Diving into Android O series for more coverage! If you can remember way back to the first Android N Developer Preview, Google introduced an all-new, redesigned Settings menu. Now with Android O, Google is changing up the Settings menu yet again. You might be thinking that this is just change for change’s sake. But I’m here to tell you that I’m really liking this new Settings menu so far… much better than the Nougat implementation. It’s more compact, and much easier to find things. For starters, you’ll notice everything looks much lighter than it was before. The backgrounds for all the tabs are a light gray, and there’s no more dark blue/gray header. Google has also done away with the teal icon accents, and instead made everything the same shade of dark gray. All of these screenshots have come from the Nexus 5X (running O) and 6P (running Nougat), but it’s worth noting that the Pixel’s settings menu, of course, features that bright Pixel blue accent color instead of the teal. Android O Settings menu (Nexus 5X) Android Nougat Settings menu (Nexus 6P) Android O battery menu (Nexus 5X) Android Nougat battery menu (Nexus 6P) In the screenshots attached above, you can see the difference between the Settings menu on Android O compared to the menu on Nougat. Google is now simply organizing each section by category, instead of listing each category with the full list of settings below it. This results in a much cleaner, easier to navigate layout. The changes are especially clear in leftmost screenshots in the gallery. One other thing worth mentioning – there’s not more slide-out navigation menu. I’m not sure if anyone was a huge fan of of that feature, but now that the Settings menu is much shorter than it was before, it makes sense why Google would remove it. Check out the other screenshots below for a closer look at the Connected devices and Bluetooth Audio sections.

LastPass Chrome & Firefox Extensions Affected by Critical Bug GO The company has issued updates for both extensions, but Mozilla is still reviewing the Firefox update before release Mar 21, 2017 22:54 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  LastPass, the password vault that you were supposed to trust with your information, was affected by a critical security flaw. Thankfully, the company has already patched things up.  This wasn't even some very complicated problem, but rather a coding error. At least that's the opinion of Google's Tavis Ormandy, security expert who has detected numerous problems over the years, including the recent Cloudflare incident. The white hat found the issue within the LastPass Chrome extension. According to Ormandy, the extension had an exploitable content script that could be attacked to extract passwords from the manager. It could also be pushed to execute commands on the victim's computer, which the Google hacker demonstrated easily. "This script will proxy unauthenticated window messages to the extension. This is clearly a mistake," Ormandy writes. Nothing was safe Since LastPass works by storing passwords in the cloud, the browser extension is your link to the LastPass account, helping you save new information as you browse the Internet. The vulnerability made it dangerous for users to even browse a malicious website as all your passwords could have been picked up by attackers. "This allows complete access to internal privileged LastPass RPC commands. There are hundreds of internal LastPass RPCs, but the obviously bad ones are things copying and filling in passwords (copypass, fillform, etc)," Ormandy added in his report. It seems that all one needed to exploit the vulnerability was two simple lines of JavaScript code. Thankfully, LastPass has already fixed the issue within its Chrome extension by disabling 1min-ui-prod.service.lastpass.com. As always, the company had been notified early on about the discovered vulnerability and worked directly with Tavis to verify the report and to create and issue a fix. Firefox too A similar vulnerability was then discovered within the LastPass Firefox extension, a bug that could be exploited by malicious webpages to extract passwords straight from the manager. It looks like LastPass has already issued a patch to fix the addon, but the updated version is in Mozilla's review process so it may take a little bit longer for it to go live. #LastPass#password manager#browser extension#Tavis Ormandy subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Nest Dropcams Can Be Taken Down via Bluetooth Vulnerabilities Man Complains Firefox Labels His Unencrypted Login Page as Insecure 7 Tips to Stay Safe from Attacks like the Fappening US Military Security Clearance Files Leak Due to Unsecured Drive Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook New Galaxy S8 and S8+ Press Shots Surface, Together with Official Teaser Super Mario Run is Now Officially Available on Android Phones Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Google Updates Duo With Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Target to Offer Freebies for Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders, Leaked Ad Shows    LastPass faced critical vulnerabilities Related Apps SCV Cryptomanager: A handy application that helps you generate various encryption for your files, using powerful algorithms, such as RSA, SHA, MD5 or Blowfish Crypt-O: Efficiently create and manage secure and custom databases with the help of this comprehensive and straightforward software solution Kerio Control: A powerful solution that was especially created in order to offer an impenetrable security layer for the protection of any networks east-tec Eraser: Protect your privacy by securely wiping confidential documents and removing traces left behind by other applications with this intuitive tool LastPass: The last password you'll have to remember - a web browser plugin for storing all user accounts in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari Emsisoft Decrypter Tools: Seamlessly clean your computer of some of the most common ransomware that can get into your computer and lock it with these tools MeeboPasswordDecryptor: Recover lost or forgotten passwords from the Meebo instant messenger with the help of this fast and easy-to-use software program Reader comments The Fappening 2.0: WWE Diva Kaitlyn Pics Exposed, More Models Too more on: The Fappening i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Just a while ago, the company added an advanced search feature to its Search engine to better suggest food recipes. Now, the search giant has added some handy new features to its popular Google Maps app to help you remember where you parked your car. Google's latest beta update for Maps on Android (v9.49) now lets you add parking reminders, according to a report by Android Police. Tapping on the blue dot that represents your location brings up the option to add reminders. You can add notes or capture photos of where you've parked your car to help you find your way back, in case you ever forget. This feature comes especially handy when parking in a multi-level structure or the airport. For areas with a timed meter, the app lets you set the parking timer to remind you how much time you have left before the meter expires. The new feature is a step more than what Apple offers with its own Maps app. Apple Maps on iOS 10 can automatically mark the location where you've left your car once your iPhone has been disconnected from the car's Bluetooth or CarPlay. The Maps app lets you edit the location of your car and add a note or a photo. With Google's Maps' new feature, you'll have to manually add your parking details, which should be more accurate than having Google Now do it for you. Manually adding notes and photos will also allow you to better assess how you want to be reminded of your parking location. You can jot down some extra details like street name or pillar number or parking level to help you find your way to the car. Additionally, Android Police reports that with he latest Google Maps beta update for Android, some users are reporting seeing a weather indicator for mass transit. The feature shows the weather at your current location and not the end destination. Interestingly, the feature doesn't seem to work for any other form of conveyance except trips through mass transit. Google is yet to officially confirm these new updates. The new Google Maps features are still in beta phase as of now and should roll out to users soon, starting with Android. In the meanwhile, Android Police in its app teardown also spotted an upcoming feature in the code, which may allow for sorting of searches.

Pop-ups are known as one of the most effective marketing tools to grow user engagement and boost conversions. However, the release of the latest Google mobile-friendly search algorithm update has completely changed the way sites featuring pop-ups are being treated by the search engine. According to Google, they will penalize web resources that contain “intrusive interstitials” or (simply put) sites that make it difficult for the web surfers to access your content from mobile devices. So, does it mean that we should completely stop using pop-ups on our sites? No way. Let’s dig deeper into the issue. Google Mobile-friendly Search Algorithm Update Google update applies to mobile web only. Browsing on mobile and reaching the desired pieces of content is more difficult than from desktop screens. That’s why Google treats interstitials as a means of making the web content less accessible for mobile users. Still, there are several ways of using pop-ups on your site that the search giant accepts. Google is looking for mobile pop-ups that are being accessed directly from the search results. The search giant doesn’t look for pop-ups displayed after the initial page view. Whenever a user reaches your page from Google search results and decides to navigate elsewhere on your page, feel free to engage them with a pop-up. Sure, these are quite unfortunate news for most of the online marketers. The use of a pop-up could increase conversions as much as 100%. However, the latest Google update has pushed them towards looking for other opportunities of growing the public engagement and boosting sales. Instead of using pop-ups you can: Embed content upgrades directly into your publications. Why is it effective? Well, only those users who are really interested in checking out the offered piece of data will subscribe or download what you provide. Use NudgeSumo to better engage with your readers. With its help, you can add CTAs to your content and indicate the value that each of them brings. For example, as a person highlights a sentence talking about the use of ready-made website templates, a writer can add a CTA asking whether a reader agrees or not on the effectiveness of the use of such products. Whenever a person clicks “yes”, you can offer them to download an eBook with guidelines on the proper use of the latter in web design. Finally, you can add a subscription or download forms directly into your content. If a person is interested, he will take an action. If not – he will simply ignore such data. How to Use TM Pop-ups and Boost Sales In order to provide you with a better understanding of how you can benefit from TemplateMonster affiliate pop-ups and prove that these really work, we would like to introduce you to a case study of one of our most successful affiliate partners who use pop-ups on their websites and boost conversions manifolds. So, please welcome Wpshopmart.     Wpshopmart is an India-based web development company focused on developing WordPress themes and plugins for personal and business purposes. Their goal is to create the best tools for you to successfully run your personal and business websites using the WordPress platform.         If you reach their site, your attention will be captured with the following pop-up revealing the top selling WordPress theme from TemplateMonster.

Soon after the pop-up was added, they attained an average of 100 of visitors per day through affiliate links. As you can see, the general number of user engagement increased more than twice. How did they manage to achieve such results? Here is a step-by-step guide on how to implement TemplateMonster pop-up into your site. Step 1. Download a WordPress pop-up plugin. Wpshopmart suggests you use Icegram. Download QR-Code Popups, Welcome Bar, Optins and Lead Generation Plugin - Icegram Developer: various Price: Free Step-2.

Wpshopmart suggests you select Persuade. Step-3. Now add some HTML content inside message-body of pop-up, where you will add affiliate product image with an affiliate link. Here is html code – <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 text-center"> <h2> Best Selling WordPress Templates </h2> </div> <div class="col-md-4"> <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes/harvest-wordpress-theme-59096.html?aff=dazzlersoft" target="_blank"><img src="images/harvest.jpg" alt="" width="496" height="797" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43461" /></a> </div> <div class="col-md-4"> <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes/homepro-real-estate-portal-wordpress-theme-61275.html?aff=dazzlersoft" target="_blank"><img src="images/homepro.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="811" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43462" /></a> </div> <div class="col-md-4"> <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes/58404.html?aff=dazzlersoft" target="_blank"><img src="images/kingsnews.jpg" alt="" width="497" height="759" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43460" /></a> </div> </div> Note: Wpshopmart is based on bootstrap css.

However, if you use the Google Wi-Fi router system, you can track this natively. Here’s how. RELATED ARTICLES How to Set Up the Google Wi-Fi System How to the Monitor the Bandwidth and Data Usage of Individual Devices on Your Network This is a good way to see which devices may be the culprit when it comes to hitting your monthly data cap, if you have one. With Google Wi-Fi, you can see how much data each device on your network is using and hopefully solve your bandwidth woes. To access this feature on your Google Wi-Fi network, start by opening up the Google Wi-Fi app and select the middle tab if it isn’t already selected. From there, tap on the circle at the bottom next to your Google Wi-Fi network’s name. You’ll see a list of devices that are connected to your Google Wi-Fi network, along with how much data they’re consuming at this very second. Tap on a device to view more info about its data usage over time. By default, you’ll see that device’s data usage over the last five seconds. However, you can view a broader history by tapping on “Last 5 Seconds” toward the top. Select a date range, which consists of either the last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or 60 days. Once selected, you’ll see how much total data was downloaded and uploaded by that device over the specified time period. So in my case, over the last seven days, my Nest Cam downloaded 229MB of data and uploaded 3.5GB of data. Using this info, you can see which devices are using up the most data, and hopefully make some changes to your setup so that you don’t hit your data cap every month.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Google says it cuts JPEG size by 35 percent with new Guetzli algorithm, but our tests don’t back that up Google says it cuts JPEG size by 35 percent with new Guetzli algorithm, but our tests don’t back that up By Joel Hruska on March 20, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Update:  Two of the slides in the bees.png file were swapped relative to what the text said was being compared. This error has been corrected. Google has announced a new and improved JPEG implementation that it claims can shrink file sizes by as much as 35% with better image quality than you’d see in an equivalent standard JPEG file. That kind of improvement would be significantly useful, if true — repeated studies have shown a distinct correlation between website load times and how likely a user is to remain engaged. Speed matters on the Internet, and Google has been focused on improving web performance for years. A joint blog post by Robert Obryk and Jyrki Alakuijala describes the new compression method as similar to Google’s Zopfli, which can be used to create smaller PNG images and gzip files. Here’s how they describe the new Guetzli (it means “cookie” in Swiss German). The visual quality of JPEG images is directly correlated to its multi-stage compression process: color space transform, discrete cosine transform, and quantization. Guetzli specifically targets the quantization stage in which the more visual quality loss is introduced, the smaller the resulting file. Guetzli strikes a balance between minimal loss and file size by employing a search algorithm that tries to overcome the difference between the psychovisual modeling of JPEG’s format, and Guetzli’s psychovisual model, which approximates color perception and visual masking in a more thorough and detailed way than what is achievable by simpler color transforms and the discrete cosine transform. However, while Guetzli creates smaller image file sizes, the tradeoff is that these search algorithms take significantly longer to create compressed images than currently available methods. Google included some of its own image assets to demonstrate the quality difference between Guetzli, a standard PNG, and a conventional JPEG. 16×16 pixel synthetic example of a phone line hanging against a blue sky — traditionally a case where JPEG compression algorithms suffer from artifacts. Uncompressed original is on the left. Guetzli (on the right) shows less ringing artefacts than libjpeg (middle) and has a smaller file size. The Guetzli image is clearly better than the conventional JPEG file created with the libjpeg library, but we wanted to create some comparisons of our own. Luckily there’s a Guetzli binary image available to download. It even includes a sample file if you want to compare image quality yourself. We were curious to see how the program’s output would stand up in testing, so we’ve done some testing of our own. All of our image editing and standard JPEG creation was done in version 4.0.13 of Paint.net. Test Setup The slideshows below contains multiple types of images, so we’re going to walk through them in advance. The first three slides consist of the bees.png file Google provided in Github, followed by the same file saved as a normal JPEG, followed by Google’s Guetzli implementation. The easiest way to see the differences between them is to open each slide in a new window, enlarge the image to 500-600%, and then tab between them. Check the flower in the lower right-hand-corner of the image and you’ll see that Guetzli does a better job of maintaining proper color compared to a regular JPEG file. Our baseline bees.png image If you zoom in on the top left bee (800% ought to do it) you’ll see a similar effect. Guetzli and the original PNG clearly show the flower’s anther — that’s the brown bit at the tip that actually contains the pollen. In the standard JPEG file, that information has been lost. The next two slides are differential comparisons. First we compare the PNG file against the normal JPEG encode, followed by a comparison of the PNG file against Guetzli. The more spots there are in the image, the greater the difference between the original PNG and the JPEG. So far, so good. The Guetzli compression clearly loses less data. But how about something a little more challenging? The next slideshow is an extreme close-up (500%) on a 4K PNG image capture from Skyrim’s special edition. You’ll want to open each image in a separate window and flip back and forth to compare them. Look at the edges of the foliage on the left-hand side to see the variations between the three files. The original image is shown below. Our base image in standard JPG (uploading a 4K PNG of this sucker would’ve left you fine people with a 32MB file to download. We perform the same differential comparison as we did in the first slideshow, but this time the results are rather different. In this case, which image looks best is arguably a matter of personal preference, and it depends on where you look. Generally speaking, Guetzli does a better job of replicating color, but look at the diagonal rock in the lower left hand corner. The standard JPEG algorithm handles that edge more closely to the PNG file, while Guetzli blurs it. Guetzli seems to struggle with accuracy in a few areas in our 4K image, producing an end result that’s actually more inaccurate than the standard JPEG. This isn’t automatically a problem since the application is still in development, but it does point to a need for further improvement. Finally, there’s the question of file size. Google claims to achieve a 35% compression improvement over JPEG, but our own tests showed exactly the opposite. Both versions of Bees.jpg were 38KB, compared to a 174KB PNG, and the 4K Skyrim scene was 5.56MB when encoded with Guetzli and 5.10MB when encoded as a standard JPEG. When we encoded the bees.png file again but at a lower quality rate (85 versus Guetzli’s 95 default quality setting), we finally did see a difference in file size. The Guetzli encode was 20KB, while the standard JPEG file was 23KB. That’s still only a 13% improvement, but if you tend to rely on lower-quality JPEG files Guetzli can theoretically reduce their size while still offering better quality than a traditional JPEG. To be clear, we aren’t accusing Google of misrepresenting anything about Guetzli. It’s possible that Paint.net isn’t the right tool to use for saving standard JPEG files if you want to see the compression differences Google claims Guetzli can make. The program is still in the early stages of development and there may be something specific about our Skyrim image that the application had trouble with. We stand by our results, particularly since we encoded our JPEG files at the Guetzli default quality level of 95, but there are a number of factors that may explain why we didn’t see the improvements Google says exist.

Stephen Shankland/CNET Mobile by Richard Nieva 22 March 2017 6:25 am AEDT @richardjnieva Android O will make your battery last longer Google's released the details on its next version of Android. Want better battery life? You got it. But what does Android O stand for? by Lexy Savvides 1:28 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Google is hoping its newest version of Android is sweeter than the last. The search giant on Tuesday announced the next generation of its mobile software, which powers almost nine out of every 10 smartphones on the planet. For now, the software is just called Android O, and it's an unfinished version, meant to give software developers a leg up before Google officially releases it. For the uninitiated, Google names each new version of Android alphabetically and after a candy or sweet. For example, the previous version was called Nougat. Before that was Marshmallow, then Lollipop. So let the naming speculation begin. Android Oreo? Oatmeal cookie? ("O" is kind of a hard one.) Among the new stuff: better battery-life features, more control over notifications, and a picture-in-picture mode for phones and tablets. The new version of Android is nicknamed "O." Google One of the biggest updates is a tweak meant to conserve your phone's juice. To do that, Google will limit what apps can do while they are launched on your phone but not actively being used. For example, now apps won't be able to do as much with location updates while they're running in the background -- which can be a big battery suck. "Building on the work we began in Nougat, Android O puts a big priority on improving a user's battery life," David Burke, vice president of engineering for Android, wrote in a blog post. Android O also tries to bring order to the deluge of notifications we get on our phones. Now users will be able to have more control over notifications within an app. They'll also be able to group together different notifications. Google has also tried to make your phone more secure with an update to Android's WebView, a widely used service that lets developers take advantage of browser technology in their apps. The update makes it harder for a maliciously coded app to steal your personal information. The Android O announcement is the first big Android update since Google unveiled its flagship Pixel phone in October. So it will be interesting to see how Google decides to build out its software from now on to take advantage of having tighter control over its hardware design. Notifications are getting a revamp in Android O. Google The new features are an upgrade, but Google's ongoing challenge with new Android releases is getting people to actually use them. That's because Android's got several different hardware and carrier partners that like to add their own flourishes to the software, so getting them all to update to the current version is a constant headache for Google. It's a problem the industry calls "fragmentation." As of the first week of March, only 2.8 percent of Android users are on the current version of the software, Nougat. The vast majority of them, almost 85 percent, are on three previous versions: Marshmallow, Lollipop and KitKat. The oldest of those, KitKat, was first released in 2013. By comparison, Apple's got 79 percent of users on iOS 10, the most current version of its software for iPhones and iPads. Other new Android O features include a picture-in-picture view on phones and tablets so you can keep watching a video while using other apps -- like hailing a car or answering a message. That feature was previously only available on Android TV. The update will also allow for better autofill options, which populate text boxes automatically with things like your name and address so you don't have to type them in repeatedly. This version of Android is specifically for software developers, but the company will detail the features in more depth at its annual software developer conference, Google I/O, in May.

It will be some months until we start seeing Android O roll out across all Android devices, but now we at least know what we’re missing out on. Don't Miss: Now is the perfect time to buy an iPhone SE Better battery life and performance It’s difficult to wave a magic wand to make everything on a phone run better and for longer, but that’s what Google is trying to do with Android O, via the magic of background apps. Google is targeting a few key areas where apps running in the background of your phone are using too much resources to basically do nothing, and making things better. The video below explains the problem of implicit broadcasts, one of the biggest problems Google is trying to address. Implicit broadcasts are when an app or service on the phone announces an event that might be of interest to other apps or services, for example when your phone reconnects to the internet after a period of lost connectivity. Those broadcasts wake up many dormant apps, and are a large part of the reason your phone’s battery dies weirdly quickly when you have spotty cell coverage. The other areas being targeted are background services and location services. Those are both features that developers have started using more recently, and the changes mostly look like they’re designed to optimize and streamline. It’s good news for Android users, although it means even more work for developers. Higher-quality audio Thanks to a partnership with Sony, Google will be integrating new Bluetooth technologies into Android O that allow for higher-quality wireless music. Given the current trend of axing headphone jacks, anything that makes Bluetooth music better is good news, and Sony’s tech is some of the best in the business. The big feature is LDAC support. LDAC is a proprietary Sony encoding system that promises better, higher-bitrate music transmission over a regular Bluetooth connection. It does require hardware that supports LDAC, which really just means Sony headphones and speakers at this point. But with free integration into Android, there’s a good chance that we’ll start seeing more LDAC headphones in the future. It also raises a worrying point, which is that we might be at the beginning of a Bluetooth unravelling. Apple’s newest wireless headphones (like the Airpods) have quick-connection features that don’t work on Android devices. If Android devices start supporting proprietary encoding methods that don’t work on iOS, it’s easy to see the currently-universal Bluetooth system devolving into a mess of competing codecs and compatibility, which would be a shame. Notifications that don’t suck One of my biggest complaints whenever I use an Android phone are the litany of unnecessary notifications. Multiple notifications from the same app are a particularly dumb kind of irritation, so it’s awesome news that Google is actually fixing this. In Android O, notifications will be grouped together to help bring down the total number of notifications. Even better, you’ll be able to choose what kinds of notifications you want. High-priority, low-priority and “marketing” will all be different options, which is good news because it means I might be able to finally disable Postmates offers about free delivery for good. Read More Picture-in-picture videos If you’ve used the YouTube app on any device in the last year, you’ll be familiar with picture-in-picture viewing. Basically, it lets you resize a video to a small box in the corner while you’re still able to browse around the device. It’s ideal for keeping an eye on something while doing something else, so Google is making it possible for videos system-wide. Keyboard support Anyone using an Android phone probably won’t care about this, but it’s superb news for Chromebook users. Basically, Google is adding better support for using keyboards to navigate Android apps. In particular, this means things like arrow keys and tab can be used to navigate through Android apps. I’ve been using a Chromebook for work lately, and the one thing stopping Android app support from being great is that you can’t tab through different fields when filling out forms. This fixes that. Much better VOIP apps Buried in the change notes is news about a “telecom framework,” which will let VOIP apps act like the device’s main telephone app. Currently, only the conventional phone app can trigger most of the features associated with voice calls, but this framework will enable any (authorized) app to work as the main phone app. This is a huge upgrade for anyone who uses a VOIP app over a data plan to make phone calls. For example, Google Hangouts offers free calling to any number in the US or Canada, so I use that to avoid any long-distance fees, or to make much cheaper overseas calls. The telecoms framework should mean more VOIP apps fill out with features, and more people can ditch their carrier-provided number. This is a good thing for customers, and awful news for any cell carriers still making money selling a $20-per-month talk-only plan.

Name: Subject: Message: Android O promises to improve battery life with background limits on apps [Diving into Android O] Newsby John Callaham2 days ago 14 2074 11 Be sure to check out our Diving into Android O series for more coverage! Battery life is definitely one of the most important, if not the most important, features when a person buys a smartphone. Getting as much use from a single battery charge is critical to so many users. With today’s official announcement, and first developer release of Android O, Google says it wants to boost the battery life on smartphones by imposing new limits on the background activities in Android apps. Google says that Android O will be the first release of the OS to place limits on background app functions. Android O will limit background app activity in three specific areas The OS will limit background app activity in three specific areas: implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates. In the case of broadcasts, Google says it is limiting those functions because too many apps that are registered to receive them, based on system events, can drain the battery of a smartphone much faster. For Android O, apps won’t be able to register for what Google calls implicit broadcasts in their manifest, which do not target one specific app. For background service limitations in apps, Android O will allow any app that is placed in the background to create and use services for a number of minutes. After that unnamed time period has expired, the app will automatically shut down any background services. This should allow a smartphone’s battery life to be extended as there won’t be a ton of apps that will continue to work in the background, even if they are not being used by the phone owner. Finally, Android O will impose limits on how long apps that need to run in the background can retrieve the user’s current location. For the first developer preview, these apps will be allowed to get location updates a few times each hour. Google says it will use these preview releases to get feedback on this feature, and it may adjust these times in future releases. Indeed, we can expect to see changes and improvements in these new features in the many forthcoming Android O developer previews before it officially launches sometime in the third quarter of 2017. Hopefully these actions by Google will make some noticeable battery improvements in any smartphone that uses the OS in the future.

It’s not exactly clear what the account will bring to the table beyond the things that the Google Design account shares, but I think it’s safe to say that it will be Material-related things, of course. Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services This comes just a few months after Google announced Material Components, which can be found at the Material.io site that the new Twitter account links to. Material Design Components (MDC) were developed by a core team of engineers and UX designers at Google to make it easier for third-party developers to create using Material on mobile and the web. And as we mentioned earlier this month, Material Design is still only now making its way into the nooks and crannies of Google’s many applications. For example, the latest Dev release of Google Chrome, which came out earlier this month, includes a Material Design extensions page, and more Material also came with stable Chrome 56 last month.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Ng Han Guan/AP/REX/Shutterstock Here are the six features in Android O that you’ll actually care about Chris Mills @chrisfmills March 21st, 2017 at 4:51 PM Share Tweet The developer preview of Android O has launched today, giving a lucky (and brave) few an advance look at the next version of Android. It will be some months until we start seeing Android O roll out across all Android devices, but now we at least know what we’re missing out on. Don't Miss: Now is the perfect time to buy an iPhone SE Better battery life and performance It’s difficult to wave a magic wand to make everything on a phone run better and for longer, but that’s what Google is trying to do with Android O, via the magic of background apps. Google is targeting a few key areas where apps running in the background of your phone are using too much resources to basically do nothing, and making things better. The video below explains the problem of implicit broadcasts, one of the biggest problems Google is trying to address. Implicit broadcasts are when an app or service on the phone announces an event that might be of interest to other apps or services, for example when your phone reconnects to the internet after a period of lost connectivity. Those broadcasts wake up many dormant apps, and are a large part of the reason your phone’s battery dies weirdly quickly when you have spotty cell coverage. The other areas being targeted are background services and location services. Those are both features that developers have started using more recently, and the changes mostly look like they’re designed to optimize and streamline. It’s good news for Android users, although it means even more work for developers. Higher-quality audio Thanks to a partnership with Sony, Google will be integrating new Bluetooth technologies into Android O that allow for higher-quality wireless music. Given the current trend of axing headphone jacks, anything that makes Bluetooth music better is good news, and Sony’s tech is some of the best in the business. The big feature is LDAC support. LDAC is a proprietary Sony encoding system that promises better, higher-bitrate music transmission over a regular Bluetooth connection. It does require hardware that supports LDAC, which really just means Sony headphones and speakers at this point. But with free integration into Android, there’s a good chance that we’ll start seeing more LDAC headphones in the future. It also raises a worrying point, which is that we might be at the beginning of a Bluetooth unravelling. Apple’s newest wireless headphones (like the Airpods) have quick-connection features that don’t work on Android devices. If Android devices start supporting proprietary encoding methods that don’t work on iOS, it’s easy to see the currently-universal Bluetooth system devolving into a mess of competing codecs and compatibility, which would be a shame. Notifications that don’t suck One of my biggest complaints whenever I use an Android phone are the litany of unnecessary notifications. Multiple notifications from the same app are a particularly dumb kind of irritation, so it’s awesome news that Google is actually fixing this. In Android O, notifications will be grouped together to help bring down the total number of notifications. Even better, you’ll be able to choose what kinds of notifications you want. High-priority, low-priority and “marketing” will all be different options, which is good news because it means I might be able to finally disable Postmates offers about free delivery for good. Picture-in-picture videos If you’ve used the YouTube app on any device in the last year, you’ll be familiar with picture-in-picture viewing. Basically, it lets you resize a video to a small box in the corner while you’re still able to browse around the device. It’s ideal for keeping an eye on something while doing something else, so Google is making it possible for videos system-wide. Keyboard support Anyone using an Android phone probably won’t care about this, but it’s superb news for Chromebook users. Basically, Google is adding better support for using keyboards to navigate Android apps. In particular, this means things like arrow keys and tab can be used to navigate through Android apps. I’ve been using a Chromebook for work lately, and the one thing stopping Android app support from being great is that you can’t tab through different fields when filling out forms. This fixes that. Much better VOIP apps Buried in the change notes is news about a “telecom framework,” which will let VOIP apps act like the device’s main telephone app. Currently, only the conventional phone app can trigger most of the features associated with voice calls, but this framework will enable any (authorized) app to work as the main phone app. This is a huge upgrade for anyone who uses a VOIP app over a data plan to make phone calls. For example, Google Hangouts offers free calling to any number in the US or Canada, so I use that to avoid any long-distance fees, or to make much cheaper overseas calls. The telecoms framework should mean more VOIP apps fill out with features, and more people can ditch their carrier-provided number. This is a good thing for customers, and awful news for any cell carriers still making money selling a $20-per-month talk-only plan.

The growing frequency of politically-motivated online attacks -- from the recent hacking of Twitter accounts by Turkish nationalists to the U.S. Democratic Party's email breach -- has left governments and pro-democracy groups scrambling for ways to thwart hackers and the rising tide of "fake" news. Alphabet Inc subsidiaries Jigsaw and Google are offering a free Protect Your Election package to low-budget organisations. The service to ward off website attacks has already been offered to news organisations for the past year under what is known as Project Shield. Last week Jigsaw, which develops security tools for civic groups, joined up with Google to defend a voter information website that came under cyber attack during the Dutch national election. The KiesKompas and Stemwijzer websites -- used by about half of Dutch voters to see which parties best match their political views -- were knocked out by a deluge of web traffic on March 14, which spilled over into election day. "The attack was not child’s play: it was very sophisticated because the attackers kept trying different avenues of attack again and again," said KiesKompas director Willem Blanken. KiesKompas, which rougly translates as ChoiceCompass, enlisted the help of Jigsaw on the evening of March 14, while Stemwijzer, or VoteGuide, signed up NBIP, a non-profit group set up by about 100 Dutch internet and telecoms providers. The election guide services remained out of action on the morning of the vote, but both were successfully restored to service around midday. FAKE NEWS, EXTREMISM The rise of Google and tech rival Facebook was welcomed as a gift to democracy and free speech against autocratic governments. More recently, however, there has been a growing backlash against fake news on social media, which has polarised political debate, and the failure to stop extremist groups using their networks to spread propaganda and find new recruits. Google vowed on Tuesday to police its websites better by ramping up staff numbers and overhauling its policies after several companies deserted the internet giant for failing to keep their adverts off hate-filled videos. A spokesman for Jigsaw said on Tuesday that it plans to offer the Protect Your Election suite free to individuals and organisations involved in forthcoming national votes in France, South Korea and Germany and subsequent elections as they occur. Jigsaw is funded by Alphabet and remains autonomous from Google, though the sister companies work together on larger-scale projects. Project Shield defends against so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that have plagued the web since about 2000 and which government and commercial experts say have intensified over the past year. Such attacks have targeted not only political parties, but also election monitors and independent news organisations in Myanmar (2010), Malaysia (2013), Ecuador (2015), Mexico (2015-2016), Montenegro (2016) and the Netherlands (2017). Hundreds of companies compete to protect websites from intruders, including Clouldflare, Akamai and Imperva Incapsula. Basic measures are often free and more robust safeguards can cost hundreds of dollars a month. However, sustained high-volume attacks at decisive moments during elections can quickly run up thousands of dollars in bills -- a big stretch for civic groups with minimal funding. BASELINE PROTECTION In addition to Project Shield, Jigsaw is offering Password Alert to ward off attempts to steal Google passwords and Two-Step Verification for an added layer of protection on web and mobile accounts as part of its Protect Your Election toolkit. News websites, human rights websites and election monitoring and information websites are eligible to apply for DDoS protection, the Jigsaw spokesman said. Candidates and campaigns are eligible for the two-password protection tools, but not the free DDoS protection. More details can be found at: g.co/protectyourelection This starter set of security tools offer baseline protection but can only go so far in thwarting the dizzying array of political shenanigans that now play out in cyberspace. They could do little, for example, to ward off the hijacking of high-profile Twitter accounts by a Turkish nationalist hacker group that took place as the Dutch voted last week and attracted widespread media attention. These attacks involved hacking into an Amsterdam-based social media analytics company to post anti-Dutch and anti-German messages amid a diplomatic spat with Turkey. Officials at the Dutch election guides said that web traffic on their sites appeared to come from various nations but the identity of the attackers remains a mystery. Several of the officials denied a De Telegraaf report that Turkey was behind the attacks. "There’s just nothing to substantiate that. We simply don’t know," KiesKompas director Blanken said. Next In FRB Exclusive: U.S. embassies ordered to identify population groups for tougher visa screening WASHINGTON/NEW YORK U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has directed U.S. diplomatic missions to identify "populations warranting increased scrutiny" and toughen screening for visa applicants in those groups, according to diplomatic cables seen by Reuters.

READ STUDIES How B2B Ecosystems & (Big) Data Can Transform Sales and Marketing Practices March 21, 2017March 21, 2017 by Ronald van Loon 23shares B2B Ecosystems & (Big) Data Managing your relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners and constantly improving their experience is a proven way to build a sustainable and profitable business, and contrary to popular assumption, this doesn’t apply to B2C businesses only. With 89% of B2B research studies using the internet during the internet research process, improved collaboration to deepen existing customer relationships and build new ones is vital to running a successful B2B business as well. This increasing need for collaboration has led to the development of digital ecosystems. Players like Apple and Google present an interesting case for how B2C ecosystems work. Consider Apple, which is primarily a B2C tech vendor, but it has built a new smart business model that pulls together technologies from multiple domains and combines them to form a solution that wins buyers acceptance. Amazon, Facebook, and Google are working on a similar kind of business model as well. So, considering the examples of these tech giants, one can suggest that in this era of personalized customer experiences, B2B ecosystems are no longer an add-on; instead, they have become a necessity for progressive B2B businesses. Offering valuable insights into customer journey, B2B ecosystems work by segmenting and targeting your audience, allowing you to deliver personalized content to clients across all channels. What’s more, with B2B ecosystems, you can improve customer engagement and develop more profitable relationships by optimizing content on various touch points that combine to form your customer journey roadmap. So, the secret to success for B2B businesses lies in collaboration and sharing of (big) data to improve customer experience and engagement. What is a B2B Ecosystem? The core concept of B2B ecosystems comes from the natural ecosystem, a biological community comprising of living and non-living things. The essential feature of any ecosystem is interdependence. For example, herbivorous animals like sheep and goats feed on plants, which in turn need water, sunlight, and minerals from soil to grow. The same concept applies to a B2B ecosystem as well, which is a community of systems working together to serve the needs of customers. Just like a natural ecosystem, a B2B ecosystem has several different components, such as: Enterprise Resource Planning System Customer Relationship Management System Product Information Management System Order Management System Marketing Automation System The list is non-exhaustive and may contain various other types of systems based on the precise needs and scope of a B2B business. The Role of B2B Ecosystems in Sales and Marketing While B2B marketing practices have changed considerably over the past few years, marketing goals have remained the same — more leads, more sales, and more revenue. However, the explosion of new marketing channels and the changing demographics of B2B customers have posed certain challenges to B2B marketers which can only be overcome through the use of unified marketing framework — a framework that connects the marketing and sales department of a business with other ‘systems’ in the ecosystem for improved collaboration and sharing of (big) data. The customer-related data of a B2B business reside in multiple systems, such as ERP, CMS, POS, PIM, Order Management, Sales Enablement, etc. To best serve the customer with a cohesive experience across all marketing channels and touch points of the customer journey, these systems must be interconnected to form a B2B ecosystem. Leveraging on a well-connected and well-equipped B2B ecosystem, marketers can: Use Customer Insights to Cross-Sell — Using the previously gathered information, B2B businesses can improvise their campaigns, as well as use the customer insights to pitch products/services that customers are most likely to invest in. Offer a Personalized Experience — For any B2B business, an ecommerce website is their most important marketing tool. Utilizing data made available from collaboration, businesses can deliver a more relevant and engaging experience to the customer from their very first visit. Optimize the Order and Reorder Processes — Using the information available about the customer and their previous purchases, businesses can optimize the order value and order frequency. Better Manage Content — Access to data residing in the content management system, markets can reuse it for different devices and across multiple channels, which in turn can help optimize the content marketing strategy to generate more leads. Facilitate Lead Nurturing — Using a marketing automation tool, businesses can track and analyze the behavioral data of customers to identify and work on the leads that are likely to nurture into a customer more quickly. Role of Leadership in the Development of a B2B Ecosystem The planning and development of a B2B ecosystem is a process that involves virtually all systems and departments of a B2B system. Therefore, in order to facilitate its implementation, commitment of senior-level management is of utmost important, particularly the Chief Information Officers have an important role to play in the process. Since a true collaborative ecosystem goes beyond the organizational boundaries, it requires an enterprise to invest in multiple technology solutions and collaborate with multiple partners, suppliers, and customers. As a result, the decision to plan and implement a B2B ecosystem requires long-term commitment of organizational leaders. B2B Ecosystems as a Source of Innovations Just like people networks, B2B ecosystems can also serve as a source of innovation. Consider Proctor & Gamble. The company leverages on its external networks to crowdsource new ideas, and as a result, possesses this unique ability to solve problems in collaboration with the members of its business network than it could do on its own. The same applies to B2B ecosystems as well. Using B2B ecosystems, sales and marketing can collaborate with other functions of the business to have a real-time access to the latest customer information. Furthermore, collaboration with extended workforce, customers, and suppliers can offer B2B businesses access to information in areas where they cannot be physically present. Internet of Things (IoT) by SAP and Cloud28+ are the two primary examples of B2B ecosystems being used by businesses today. In addition to this, collaboration solutions by Lithium and Jive also provided B2B businesses with a way to improve their collaboration with suppliers, business partners, and customers to develop a B2B ecosystem that offers them greater access to data and improve visibility and control over their customer journey and experiences.

Gadget Hacks Android Hacks WonderHowTo Gadget Hacks Invisiverse Next Reality Driverless Null Byte Android Basics Glossary of Terms Galaxy S8 Rumors HTC 11 Rumors Everything Pixel Rooting Guide Gaming Roundups Forum Stay Secure How-Tos News News: Google Releases Android O Developer Preview—Here's a Rundown of the New Features By Fionnuala O'Leary Tue 1:38 PM Gadget Hacks Google Releases Android O Developer Preview—Here's a Rundown of the New Features The first sneak peak of Android O is finally here. The developer preview promises more features, stabilization, and better performance, according to the Android Developers Blog. Furthermore, there's speculation that the latest operating system will be code-named "Android Oreo," so it definitely sounds like we're in for a treat. The preview version of Android O is only available for Nexus and Pixel users at the moment, and it's the very first iteration, so we can expect a few minor bugs. But Google plans to issue iterative updates to Android O over the coming months, which is par for the course with Android's developer preview program. Don't Miss: How to Install Android O on Your Pixel or Nexus Right Now New Features Background limits are one of the string of changes this update will bring for users. To improve battery life, Android O will limit what apps can do in the background, which, among other things, includes restricting location updates. A new Autofill API should make it easier to populate saved addresses, user names, and even passwords into all of your apps. It'll work similarly to the feature in Google Chrome, except the new Autofill data will be stored by the system and made available to any app that calls on the new APIs. Notifications are getting another overhaul after being revamped in Android Nougat. A new system called "Notification channels" has been introduced, which will let apps define certain categories for the notifications they post. Users will get increased control over the new notifications, as each of the individual channels can be blocked or silenced as opposed to blocking all notifications from an individual app. Image via Android Developers Blog Meanwhile, Picture in Picture (PIP) display is now available on phones and tablets, which allows people to watch videos and chat simultaneously. Apps can go from paused to PIP mode wherever an app supports it, whilst specifying the aspect ratio and a set of custom interactions. A new app overlay window (replacing system alert window) and multi-display support (launches activity on remote display) are the other windowing features included. Adaptive Icons are also a welcome addition. This lets app developers make one version of their app's icon that will show up as square, circle, or another shape depending on the device. In other words, different devices can have different icon layouts (square/circle/squircle/etc) now, but developers won't have to make a unique version for every device. Image via Android Developers Blog Android O also contains new Hi-Fi Bluetooth codecs that should improve wireless sound quality—most notably, one from Sony called the LDAC Codec. The new Android version will also give developers the ability to add arrow keys and a tab button to their third-party keyboard apps. Similar to the functions on desktop computers, this means you'll be able to navigate around text field with pinpoint precision. However, apps like Swiftkey and Gboard would have to be updated to support the feature. Additional changes include font resources in XML, wide-gamut color for apps, a new Wi-Fi Aware feature, and keyboard navigation, amongst other minor tweaks. Try Android O Right Now Although the preview is available now, you can only install it if you're brave enough to use Fastboot to sideload the update, and only then if you have one of Google's Nexus or Pixel devices. If that's you, just head to the Android O download page to grab the images, then use the following guide to flash them: Don't Miss: The Complete Guide to Flashing Factory Images with Fastboot Follow Gadget Hacks on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and YouTube Follow Android Hacks on Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest Follow WonderHowTo on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Google+ Cover image via Rob Bulmahn/Flickr Related News: Night Mode Is Coming to Android!

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Maps now has detailed parking saving feature By Ida Torres - March 21, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Drivers have probably always experienced the panicky feeling when you suddenly forget where you parked. Fortunately, there are now various ways to ensure that you do not “lose” your car, apart from drawing a map to and from the parking lot. Now Google Maps will try to make it even easier for you by bringing you a “proactive parking saving feature”, which will show your car’s location on the map and even alert you when your parking time is almost over. There wasn’t any major announcement from Google regarding this new feature, but users have already reported seeing it on their Google Maps. Previously, a similar feature was available on Google Now, but it used your phone’s sensor to assume when you’ve parked, which meant when you got off a bus or train, it would tell you you’ve parked somewhere. But now, despite it being manual of course, it is much easier to use the feature for when you are actually parking. This will appear as a new menu option when you tap the blue dot. Once you do so, it will place a P in the map to symbolize where you parked, and so when you come back, you only have to follow the sign in case you forgot your spot. You can also add notes like what floor, which entrance is nearest to your car, etc. You can even add multiple photos in case you need a more visual reminder. And if you’re on timed parking, you can put how much time you’re allotted and when it’s nearing its expiration, you will get a notification from Google Maps. The parking saving feature is available on version 9.49 of Google Maps. So if you haven’t updated your app, you can do so now so you will never get lost in a parking lot again.

The two companies are offering a “Protect Your Election” package for free to low-budget operations to help them fend off cyber attacks and insure the integrity of the electoral process. A version of the protection has been offered to new organizations as a service called Project Shield. Read: Google Removes 200 From Ad Network For Misleading Users The Protect Your Election suite provides groups that run elections with a defense against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that can overload servers and shut down computer systems—a safeguard that usually costs thousands of dollars to maintain. DDoS attacks—which have increased in recent years as the resources to carry out such an attack have become more accessible—have been used to target election monitors and news organizations in a number of countries including Myanmar, Malaysia, Ecuador, Mexico, Montenegro and the Netherlands. Through Jigsaw, a feature called Password Alert will also be offered. The service will provide two-factor authentication for web and mobile accounts to help protect against attempts to hack the accounts. News organizations, human rights sites, election monitoring organizations, and information distribution sites will all be eligible to use the DDoS protection provided by Protect Your Election. Campaigns and candidates won’t but, but can make use of the Password Alert service to protect their accounts. Read: Meet CyberBerkut, The Pro-Russian Hackers Waging Anonymous-Style Cyberwarfare Against Ukraine A number of countries with upcoming elections will be taking advantage of Protect Your Election, including France, South Korea and Germany. The service was previously put to use in the Netherlands when a website that helped visitors see which candidate they most closely aligned with was knocked offline. The site was reportedly used by about half of Dutch voters until it went dark due to an influx of traffic just before the election. While the source of that attack remains unknown, the service provided by Google and Jigsaw was used to help get the website back online by election day.

The steps come in response to an advertiser backlash over recent reports that the Alphabet Inc. unit frequently displays ads next to inappropriate content such as fabricated news stories or terrorist videos. The company also said it would employ more people and technology to enforce the new policies. "We know advertisers don't want their ads next to content that doesn't align with their values," Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said in a blog post Tuesday. "So starting today, we're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content." Major advertisers such as HSBC Holdings PLC and L'Oréal SA reduced spending with Google in recent days after news reports that Google regularly served their ads on controversial websites or YouTube videos, including some made by supporters of terrorist groups such as Islamic State and a violent pro-Nazi group. Google had long said existing controls guard against marketers' spots appearing alongside controversial content. But after the advertiser pushback in the U.K., Google on Friday and again Monday acknowledged that those measure fell short, and vowed to improve. The speed with which Google announced the measures suggests the tools were already at its disposal. Yet enforcing the new policies could be tricky. Google must screen a sea of content that every day adds thousands of websites and nearly 600,000 hours of new YouTube footage. And while some controversial content, such as pornography or neo-Nazi sites, clearly violates its standards for advertising, other cases are nuanced and require human review. Google's announcement "is a first step. But, importantly, it doesn't just end here," said Max Kalehoff, chief marketing officer of SocialCode, which helps market brands on social networks including YouTube. Advertising on the internet involves a complex system that automatically places ads in front of targeted audiences wherever they are on the web, he said. "The notion of context is a moving target. We're not talking about linear TV where you had a spoon-fed, tightly controlled stream of content to a mass audience," he added. Google has long aimed to position itself as a neutral platform connecting advertisers with vast amounts of content on the internet created by others, including millions of videos on its YouTube site and more than 2 million websites served by its ad-distribution business. That approach has been lucrative for Google as it has monetized far ends of the internet -- with sometimes edgy content -- while also giving marketers a broader reach for their ads. But with spending on digital ads surpassing that on television ads last year in the U.S., according to eMarketer, increasing scrutiny from advertisers is forcing internet companies like Google and Facebook Inc. to take more responsibility for the content on which they serve ads. Google, in effect, is becoming a reluctant policeman for the internet. The British unit of Volkswagen AG's Audi, which had pulled its YouTube ads, said Tuesday that it welcomes "the swift action Google is taking to address these concerns," and "once we have a committed time frame from Google clarifying when these safeguards will be implemented across the board, we will have a closer discussion with the brand and fully assess our position in the U.K." Rob Norman, chief digital officer of the ad-buying unit of ad company WPP, said that a handful of his clients suspended advertising on YouTube in the U.K. and that his group has pressured Google to improve controls for advertisers. "As with traditional media owners, Google and other digital platforms should take responsibility for their content," said WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell. Ad spending affected so far is relatively small, but the attention to the issue prompted Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser to downgrade Alphabet's stock to hold from buy. "We think that awareness of the incident will marginally curtail global growth this year vs. prior expectations," Mr. Wieser wrote in a research note Monday. Serving ads on third-party websites earned Google for $15.6 billion last year, or 17.3% of Alphabet's overall revenue. YouTube revenue is unclear. As part of the changes, Google plans to expand a policy that prohibits ads from running alongside content that attacks or harasses people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. Current policy focuses on content that advocates violence toward such groups; the new policy applies to any content that is incendiary or demeaning to such people. That change is likely to be among the most controversial with website owners and YouTube video creators who rely on Google for ad revenues, as its broad scope could include a wide variety of content. The company also said it would place ads only on the YouTube videos of "legitimate creators" and pull ads from the videos of those that "impersonate other channels or violate our community guidelines." Google also is reviewing its policies to determine whether more YouTube videos should be removed from the site. Google is changing the default settings for ads to limit them to more mainstream sites and videos, requiring brands to opt in to advertising on broader -- and sometimes edgier -- types of content such as such as videos peddling extremist views, conspiracy theories or misinformation. Google said it would simplify how advertisers control where their ads appear, including giving advertisers the ability to blacklist specific sites or YouTube videos. Google said it would give advertisers more transparency on where their ads appear, though Mr. Schindler's post specifically mentioned only the expansion to all advertisers of an existing tool that tells brands every YouTube video on which their ads ran. Google said it also plans to hire significant numbers of people and develop technology "to increase our capacity to review questionable content." And the company plans to make it easier for advertisers to flag issues, with the goal of resolving problem cases within two hours, a person familiar with the matter said. A Google spokeswoman said the policies would take effect "in the coming weeks."

Google has found itself at the center of a British storm in recent days after major companies from supermarkets to banks and consumer groups pulled their adverts from its YouTube site after they appeared alongside videos carrying homophobic and anti-Semitic messages. Alphabet’s Google launched a review of the problem on Friday, apologized on Monday and said on Tuesday it had revamped its policies to give advertisers more control. The company, which had said it struggled to monitor the 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, said it would hire significantly more staff and speed up the process of removing ads from hateful and offensive content that attacks people based on their race, religion or gender. “We believe the combination of these new policies and controls will significantly strengthen our ability to help advertisers reach audiences at scale, while respecting their values,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said in a blog. Why do progressive companies like Google create such cesspits of homophobic and anti-Semitic messaging in the first place?

According to the FBI’s Denver field office, scammers are calling victims from what appears to be an FBI number and telling them they are being investigated by the bureau for violations and owe money. If the victims don’t pay up immediately, the scammers claim, they will be arrested. The scheme has targeted victims throughout the region. "FBI" scammers who have called victims in northern Colorado have been able to "spoof" an actual phone number from an FBI office in the western part of the state, meaning the FBI number is fraudulently displayed by caller ID. The FBI strongly suggests that given the rushed and threatening nature of the calls, victims should hang up on the scammer right away and contact their local FBI field office. Last year, the FBI’s St. Louis, Missouri Division issued a news release warning the public about a similar spoofing scam in which a fake FBI agent told victims the bureau was investigating a tax violation. Scammers spoofed numbers from the FBI’s offices in Eastern Missouri to call victims in Western Missouri.  “These are old scams that keep evolving with a new twist,” said William Woods, special agent in charge of the FBI St. Louis Division. “Just remember, the FBI does not call or e-mail private citizens to demand money or threaten arrest.” Facebook Twitter Email Mar 21 2017, 5:29 pm ET by Andrew Blankstein advertisement advertisement latest posts from Intel Desk 20 hours ago Drone Strike Kills Taliban Leader Who Trained Suicide Bombers The Pakistani Taliban said a U.S. drone strike over the weekend in Afghanistan killed a senior military commander who was known for his skill in training suicide bombers. Qari Mohammad Yasin, also known as Ustad Aslam, died in a drone strike in Afghanistan's Paktika province. He was linked to an attack ‎on the Pakistani military headquarters in Rawalpindi and an attack on a bus carrying Sri Lanka's national cricket team. "We lost a brave man and the trainer of trainers in a U.S drone attack," said Asad Mansoor, the spokesman of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan Jamaatul Ahrar ( TTP-JA), a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban, presently based in Afghanistan.  Yasin was given the title "Ustad," or teacher, because he trained suicide bombers. Facebook Twitter Email a day ago Family of Missing Ex-FBI Agent Levinson Files Suit Against Iran The family of a former FBI agent turned CIA consultant who vanished in Iran ten years ago filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the government of Iran, saying it had lied to cover up its role in his detention. The suit seeks damages from Iran for allegedly inflicting emotional distress on the wife and seven children of Robert A. Levinson, a private investigator who was last seen in 2007 on the Iranian island of Kish. He was apparently on an unauthorized CIA mission at the time. The Iranian government says it does not know what happened to Levinson. The family received a proof of life photo in 2011 showing Levinson in an orange jumpsuit holding a sign saying, "HELP ME." Levinson, whose 69th birthday was on March 10, was apparently kidnapped on March 9, 2007. The suit alleges that the Iranian government is using photographs and video of Levinson in captivity to create the false impression that someone other than the government is holding him. This undated handout photo provided by the family of Robert Levinson after they received it in April 2011, shows retired-FBI agent Robert Levinson.\ Levinson family via AP Facebook Twitter Email 2 days ago The FBI Doesn't Call You Up and Ask for Money The FBI is warning the public to beware of calls from the FBI.

The Trump Organization, the umbrella corporation for Donald Trump's holdings, owns the skyscraper at 725 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and is headquartered there. Donald and Melania Trump have a penthouse in the tower and Trump's sons also maintain offices in the building. Property owners of certain residential buildings are required by city law to register with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation & Development every year, but Trump Tower’s registration expired in 2016 and The Trump Organization never renewed it. Failing to register can result in a fine of up to $500, and revokes some of the rights usually enjoyed by property owners. On Tuesday morning, NBC News contacted The Trump Organization. Not long after, according  to city officials, a representative of The Trump Organization sent the necessary paperwork to the agency. "This was an inadvertent clerical error that has since been remedied," a spokesperson for the Trump Organization told NBC News.   Trump Tower in New York in May 2016. Jason Szenes / EPA, file Facebook Twitter Email 2 days ago Trump's Business Is In Violation of New York City Law Donald Trump’s business, The Trump Organization, is in violation of New York City law, NBC News has learned. The Trump Tower skyscraper located at 725 Fifth Avenue -- where President Trump and Melania live in the penthouse apartment and his two eldest sons work in offices just below -- is not registered this year with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation & Development, a spokeswoman for the department confirmed on Tuesday. Property owners of certain residential buildings are required by law to register annually by Sept. 1, but Trump Tower’s registration expired in 2016 and The Trump Organization did not renew it until today. Failing to register can result in a fine of up to $500, and revokes some of the rights usually enjoyed by property owners. The Trump Organization has a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower. The loan was written by Wall Street firm Ladder Capital Financial and it now resides in a trust and has been securitized. The managing agent on the expired registration for Trump Tower is listed as the Trump Corporation. The “head officer” is Richie Ukaj, whose LinkedIn profile says he is the resident manager at The Trump Organization. The “officer” is listed as Sonja Talesnik, whose LinkedIn profile says she is the assistant general counsel and vice president, property administration at The Trump Organization. Calls and messages to a spokeswoman for The Trump Organization were not immediately returned. Facebook Twitter Email 3 days ago Royal Jordanian Tells Passengers U.S. Is Barring Electronic Devices From Its Flights Royal Jordanian Airlines told passengers on flights to and from the U.S. Monday that because of a directive from the U.S. government, no laptops and other electronic devices could be brought into the cabin of a plane. In messages posted on both Twitter and Facebook and now deleted, the international carrier said cellphones and electronic devices needed for medical reasons could be carried on-board,but everything else had to be stowed in checked baggage "following instructions from the concerned U.S. departments."  The directive takes effect Tuesday, and applies to flights to and from New York, Chicago, Detroit and Montreal.  According to a Royal Jordanian spokesperson, so far there is no time frame and the airline has no information about any directives that may have been issued to other carriers. Royal Jordanian will provide an update with more details on Tuesday. Post by NBC News. Facebook Twitter Email 3 days ago Companies Pull Ads From Google, YouTube Over Racist, Terrorist Content Major European clients are pulling their ad dollars out of Google and YouTube because of fears that their ads will end up next to videos promoting terrorism, racism and hate, and earn money for the extremists who posted the content. Three of Britain’s biggest banks just removed their ads from Google when they saw their campaigns appearing next to extremist content. According to Adweek and the Guardian, ad agency giant Havas Worldwide has also yanked all its ad money out of Google and YouTube in Britain, after Havas and Google couldn’t agree on how to keep the ads of French firm’s clients away from videos of terrorists and white supremacists. McDonald’s, Audi, and the U.K. government have already stopped using the platforms in the U.K., amid concerns that extremist groups will earn money from their advertising. When an ad appears alongside a YouTube video, the individual or organization that posted video earns a small amount of money per viewing of the video.   Facebook Twitter Email 6 days ago Secret Service Racks Up Bills for Trump Kids' Trips. Next Stop Aspen? President Donald Trump's family is reportedly headed to the ski resort town of Aspen this weekend, a trip that could cost taxpayers a pretty penny in security costs judging by the clan's recent globe-trotting. The Trump family visit to Aspen has not been officially announced, but the Aspen Times, quoting anonymous local law enforcement sources, reported Thursday that Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump and their families were expected and that the Secret Service had met with the Aspen Police Department. There are no hotel bills for Aspen in the Federal Procurement Data System yet, but the database does show a $12,208.25 contract by the Secret Service with Aspen Valley Ski/Snowboard Club for "recreational good rental/ski equipment lease" between the dates of March 10 and March 23. No further details were given, and the club's spokeswoman did not respond to requests for more information. Federal documents examined by NBC News outline hotel bills for the U.S. Secret Service and State Department coinciding with other out-of-town visits by Trump's sons and daughters, including: $53,155.25 during Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump's business trip to Vancouver in late February. $16,738.36 during Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump's business trip to Dubai in mid-February. $97,830 for Eric Trump's business trip to Uruguay in early January. In addition, the records show the Secret Service spent $4,0162.02 on rental vehicles in the Dominican Republic on Jan. 29, just ahead of Eric Trump's business visit to Cap Cana.

Pentagon Asks Employees Not to Watch March Madness March Madness is not a threat to our national security, but Pentagon officials are giving employees their annual reminder not to go crazy over college basketball. In an email sent Wednesday night, the Defense Department asked workers not to stream games from the tournament or they would feat up the Pentagon’s valuable internet bandwidth, and slow down the computers that run the U.S. military: "Your JSP support team acknowledges and appreciates that college basketball fans within the DoD are excited to cheer on their favorite teams, update brackets, and otherwise obsess over the Big Dance."

Facebook Twitter Email 7 days ago Russians Got Flynn to Take a Pay Cut for Moscow Speech Documents released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee show a representative from RT, the Russian television network, successfully negotiating a lower speaking fee from Mike Flynn, the retired general who served briefly as Donald Trump’s national security advisor before stepping down amid questions about his foreign ties. Flynn spoke at an RT conference in December 2015, and was famously seated at the same table as Russian President Vladimir Putin. The documents released this afternoon by the Oversight Democrats show Flynn’s booking agent for speeches, a company called Leading Authorities, negotiating logistics for the visit with the head of marketing for RT, a state-sponsored broadcaster. Click Here to Read the Documents While critics have suggested that Flynn was influenced by Russian money, the email chain shows RT asking for a discount, and getting a quick yes from Flynn’s rep. “Sorry it took us longer to get back to you” writes Alina Mikhaleva of RT on Nov. 9, 2015, “but the problem is that the speaking fee is a bit too high and exceeds our budget at the moment, so we had to negotiate it with the management. Do you think there is any possibility to reduce the price to 45K?” Flynn’s rep responds, “Great news! He has accepted (followed by a smiley face emoticon) … I can get a contract over to you stat.” The size of the fee Flynn originally requested is not in the document, but at the time Leading Authorities was asking for up to $55,000 for appearances in Europe and $75,000 for events in Asia, according to Yahoo News.  The top Republican and top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee sent a letter to the Defense Department on Feb. 17 saying they were looking into Flynn's speaking engagements. "We are attempting to determine the amount Lieutenant General Flynn received for his appearance, the source of the funding, and whether he may have received payments from any other foreign sources for additional engagements," wrote Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R.-Utah, and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D.-Maryland. Facebook Twitter Email advertisement advertisement Top stories J.

This is because the government split their omnibus bill – the political artifice to tie a generally good childcare package to unpalatable welfare cuts. Overnight, it was made clear that the bill would be split up (as it was originally) in order to get the childcare package through. The cuts would be put through in a separate bill. The rest of the cuts, some of which stretch back to the 2014 Abbott budget, will be held in abeyance. They include measures like the four-week wait for the dole, which the social services minister, Christian Porter, was eager to point out had not been dumped but rather parked. Nick Xenophon and Pauline Hanson are in negotiations with the government over the package. Their parties both supported changing Senate sitting hours to deal with the bills so presumably they are getting close to a deal. Sussan Ley released the finance investigation that found she only breached travel rules once in three-and-a-half years and paid it back. She said she was not complaining but merely releasing the report and allowing people to draw their own conclusions. In the federation, Ley said: “Regardless of these facts, the public impression was cast. I can understand the facts can get lost in the search for a good story.” That was why she resigned from the ministry, Ley said. The industry and science minister, Arthur Sinodinos, said marriage equality should be settled in this parliamentary term as the Liberal MP and campaigner Warren Entsch welcomed Peter Dutton’s attempts to land a solution behind the scenes. Why would an anti-marriage equality conservative do such a thing? Machiavelli might suggest to own the process ahead of Labor but nothing has actually been confirmed on the record by PDuddy. The bill to amend 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act will be introduced but not debated in the Senate shortly.

Alice Workman (@workmanalice) Former health min Sussan Ley is says she resigned because "the facts could not overcome the story". pic.twitter.com/koZJd0oaWO March 22, 2017 Julia Holman of the ABC reports: An independent report into all of Liberal MP Sussan Ley’s work travel expenses has found she breached the rules once over a three-and-a-half year period. The former health minister was forced to step down from her position in the cabinet earlier this year following revelations she bought an $800,000 apartment during a work trip to the Gold Coast. The independent report, conducted and released today by the finance department, found the sole breach of the rules occurred when Ms Ley used a government-funded car to take her from her hotel to the apartment. The trip lasted about five minutes. Prior to her resignation as a minister, there were other claims she had breached the rules, including billing taxpayers to attend two New Year’s Eve events hosted by a prominent Queensland businesswoman and donor, and piloting a plane when other, less-expensive options were available. But the report found Ms Ley did not breach the rules in any of those instances.

Why is this PM continuing with the $30bn cut to schools at the same time as he’s giving a $50bn tax cut to big business? Turnbull repeats the standard line about record funding for schools, which of course it is because school funding is indexed. (The school funding agreements for the next two years, years five and six of the former Gillard agreements, have yet to be revealed.)

Turnbull says the law is now optional for Labor and the union movement. Having a long and distinguished career in the union movement, the honourable member would say what a fundamental issue and principle it was for the Labor party to defend the independent umpire in setting wages and conditions. But not any longer, because now in line with the new ideological leader of the Labor movement, Sally McManus ... the law is optional for trade unions, apparently. The PM follows on in that vein and takes a comment from Labor that he is obsessed. I’m obsessed, am I? We’re obsessed about the law. We’re obsessed about obeying the law. We’re obsessed about integrity. We’re obsessed about ensuring that the members of the unions you claim to represent are represented honestly and fairly and with the respect and the diligence that they deserve and you have failed them.

Can the PM guarantee that these workers will not have their pay cut because of the precedent set by the penalty rates decision which the PM supported. And will the PM make a submission to the Fair Work Commission to protect the penalty rates of workers in these industries? Turnbull makes the point that Bill Shorten and Brendan O’Connor had previously agreed to abide by the Fair Work Commission on penalty rates. No one can complain that the opposition’s question time strategy doesn’t have a lot of variety. Leaping from one topic to another. No plan for childcare. No plan for energy. No plan for question time.

Mr Bolt replied, “Let’s say five.” Given the government has cited Andrew Bolt as a reason for watering down race hate protections, is it the intention of the government that Australians must be subject to five separate instances of racist abuse before before it constitutes harassment? Turnbull says the bill specifically states that a single act can constitute harassment. He says the law on sexual harassment establishes that a single act can constitute harassment for that area too. It is expressly stated in the bill.

Although we touched upon all of the big hitters, we felt one in particular deserved a special mention. Audio beamed to Bluetooth headphones and speakers will sound a lot better on Android O, thanks to Sony. The company has ‘donated’ (Google’s word) its proprietary LDAC wireless audio encoding format. Why is this so significant? Well it sends three-times more data through Bluetooth than competing standards. Sony describes the tech as follows: "LDAC is an audio coding technology developed by Sony that enables the transmission of High-Resolution (Hi-Res) Audio content, even over a Bluetooth connection." This could mean far superior audio, especially for hi-res tracks, through wireless headphones on smartphones and tablets upgraded to Android N. Great news, right? But before you go congratulating Sony and dishing out some kind of humanitarian award for the gesture, the firm isn’t doing it out of the kindness of its heart. As you may have guessed, the LDAC format is currently limited to headphones built by Sony, such as the £330 MDR-1000X and other compatible products. Related: Sony MDC-1000X review Whether Sony will be kind enough to cheaply license LDAC to other headphone and audio accessory manufacturers remains to be seen, but we won’t be holding our breath (via Engadget). Elsewhere, Google says, Sony Mobile has contributed other 30 feature enhancements and 250 bug fixes to Android O. Would this be a reason for you to invest in a new set of wireless headphones? Or will it encourage you to buy your first pair, full of hope your hi-res tracks will actually sound decent now? Share your thoughts below. 0 shares Read Comments Ewok March 21, 2017, 10:49 pm The funny thing is bluetooth 5.0 which was released last year (and has been largely designed for high res audio) and will now be filtering into devices (such as the S8) has 800% more bandwidth than BT 4.2 at twice the speed and 4x the range, and won't need ldac at all. So adding ldac to 'O' might provide very short term benefit to users with older devices that have ldac, but to anyone else it will shortly make no difference as any newer device that has bt 5.0 will not need ldac anyway. Jason March 22, 2017, 1:15 pm The problem is that Bluetooth's native audio codec, SBC, has not been advancing along with Bluetooth itself. So while Bluetooth gets greater bandwidth and range with the new versions, the audio quality remains the same as it has been since around version 2. Sure, you get much better audio quality with AptX or LDAC, but both of these are proprietary technologies that manufacturers have to license. What we need is for Bluetooth's SBC codec to be improved or replaced.

You will learn from and work alongside top-notch faculty and researchers at the helm of our 21st-century fields of study. https://nmsu.edu/ Elena Davidson, New Mexico State University Honors Student Will be doing more than Googling something this summer.  Not only will she know Google as a search engine, she will get to know the company from the inside as an engineering practicum intern. She was accepted into the 12-week developmental program from May to August. The engineering practicum program is open to first- and second-year undergraduate students interested in the technology field. Advertisement Continue reading A sophomore computer science major, Davidson will be working with a team on a software project at Google’s Mountain View, California, location. “Google is the place to intern if you’re a computer science major or an electrical engineering major, and I am excited about absolutely everything about this internship,” Davidson said. “I’m excited to get my feet wet and really start taking what I learned in the classroom here at NMSU and applying it in the workplace. I’m looking forward to networking with these amazing Googlers and other interns. “For a girl born and raised in Las Cruces, New Mexico, I’m also excited about living in the Bay Area for a summer.” NMSU Honors College Dean Miriam Chaiken speaks very highly of Conroy Scholars and said Davidson is no exception. “We knew when we were recruiting students as Conroy Scholars that these were people with enormous capability and potential,” Chaiken said. “Elena’s success in earning this prestigious opportunity as only a sophomore is proof that our expectations were accurate. Elena and her fellow Conroy Scholars are definitely going places.” High school students who are national merit semi-finalists or national Hispanic merit semi-finalists are eligible for the Conroy Scholarship beginning with their freshman year. Students’ PSAT scores determine whether they are invited to apply for the scholarship, which is a four-year offer if a 3.5-grade point average is maintained. Davidson said her hands-on experience at NMSU has helped prepare her for this opportunity. She was a camp assistant and research assistant with the Young Women in Computing program for over a year. Daniela Miranda-Tellez was the program coordinator for Young Women in Computing when Davidson worked with the program. Advertisement Continue reading “Elena has always brought an outstanding approach to her work through her strong desire to connect with the program participants and families,” Miranda-Tellez said. “I have no doubt she’ll do an exceptional job at Google because she has always demonstrated a tremendous drive to succeed.” Davidson recently began working in the NMSU Media Productions and Learning Games Lab in the College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences. In her new position, she will assist with application development and website creation from an educational perspective. She equated the competitive Google application process to that of an Ivy League school. She said her recruiters and interviewers emphasized the importance of the applicants’ ability, passion, and problem-solving capabilities. She also said that both NMSU and her family have provided her with much-needed support. “NMSU has such an amazing, supportive and encouraging environment,” she said. “I wouldn’t be able to go into this internship if it weren’t for all of the opportunities NMSU has provided me. I also want to thank my mom, dad, sister and the rest of my family for their encouragement and excitement regarding the internship. My entire family has been so supportive, now and always.” Google employs over 50,000 people in 50 countries. The company makes hundreds of products used by billions of people, including YouTube, Android, Google Search, and Smartbox.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Everything you need to know about the Android O developer preview Everything you need to know about the Android O developer preview By Ryan Whitwam on March 21, 2017 at 4:43 pm Comment The annual Google I/O conference isn’t for a few months yet, but Google has just taken the wraps off the latest version of Android. It’s called Android O. We don’t know what the official name is, or even what the version number will be. However, the feature set is out in the open with the release of a developer preview build for recent Google devices. Google is making a number of big changes to the user experience with some cool video stuff, revamped notifications, improved power savings on background processes, and more. Picture-in-picture video Google actually added picture-in-picture (PiP) support in Android 7.0 Nougat, but it was only enabled for Android TV boxes. That didn’t exactly get developers on-board. How, Android O brings PiP to all phones and tablets. That means you’ll be able to shrink videos down to a floating window so you can do something else without stopping playback. You know, what we’ve been able to do for years on desktops. The catch here is that developers need to add support. They can define the aspect ratio of the floating video, as well as custom controls.We don’t know exactly how this will work yet, because not even YouTube in the preview image supports the feature. Notifications There are two big things happening in notifications. One of which you can play around with right away after installing the preview. Snoozing notifications allows you to get them out of your face, but not completely dismiss them. By dragging the notification to the side just a little, you’ll see a new snooze button next to the settings icon. Tap that and the notification will snooze for 15 minutes. You can also cancel or tap the snooze alert to change the length of time to 30 minutes or an hour. At the end, the notification appears again. The other change will require developers to get their apps updated. Notification channels will allow you to control what an app sends you right from the notification shade. So, if you want to hear about tech news from your news app but don’t care about fashion, the notification could let you disable the channel for fashion. In Android 7.0 and earlier, you can only block notifications for entire apps. Background process limits Android has a long and sordid history with background processes. There was a time when killing them was necessary, then killing them broke things, then Google finally added doze mode to make processes behave themselves. Doze was improved in Android 7.0 to work even when the device was moving, and in Android O Google is adding something new called background limits. Android O places automatic limits on what apps can do in the background by throttling implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates. This should mean that apps have a smaller impact on your battery life while they’re in the background. For developers, it requires new techniques to make sure your app can do what it needs to do in the background. Autofill API We all know the pain of typing out the same information again and again on a phone. It might be a password, your address, or whatever. Autofill apps right now are based on the accessibility service, and they’re really not very reliable. Android O adds a new autofill API, so apps can register with the system as a provider of autofill services. Currently nothing available, unfortunately. You’ll select a system-wide autofill app in the settings just like you would a keyboard. That app will have the ability to securely and seamlessly store data like passwords and text snippets. I’d love to see Lastpass enable this as soon as possible after release. Developers do need to add support for the API, so there’s nothing live on Android to test this so far. Adaptive icons This is a small change, but it’s something that could become very noticeable as phones start shipping with Android O late this year. We’ve all seen a device from Samsung or LG that insists on using icons with a particular shape, usually squircles or squares. Google does circles. The apps you install often don’t match that aesthetic, but adaptive icons will make it easier to get everything looking the same. Device makers can set a mask for icons… maybe a squircle? Apps that have been updated with adaptive icons will be rendered on the device to match that outline so they’ll fit in better. This all happen automatically, sort of how it does on Pixel phones where developers have packaged circular icons. This is sort of the next step. Everything else Android O includes a number of smaller tweaks as well. Some that are worth mentioning include the addition of Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN), which is an implementation of the WiFi Aware standard. It will allow devices to find each other automatically and form a bridge without an AP. This allows you to send data at high speed between devices. It also supports low-power mode for streaming just a little data. There’s also a new “AAudio” API for high-performance, low-latency audio. Color gamut has also been improved with support for wide color profiles including AdobeRGB, Pro Photo RGB, and DCI-P3. There’s also a completely new system settings UI that includes a handy list of all your connected devices in one place. When can I get it? If this all sounds like something you want, the developer preview is available now. It’s still buggy and it only works on certain devices. You can flash if you’ve got a Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel C, Pixel, or Pixel XL. There’s no OTA beta program yet, so you need to do the full image installation. That involves resetting your device. A beta program will probably be available later. There are supposed to be four developer preview updates, followed by the final version in Q3 2017. So, we’re looking at a fall release for Android O. At that time we’ll find out what the version number and code name are. The update will roll out to Google devices within a few weeks, but OEMs will take at least a few months to get their updates out the door. Anything released in 2017 will be first up, followed by 2016 devices a bit later. Anything older than that, and an update will be very delayed or simply not available.

Android O is now official. It’s not surprising that the next major release of Android will be “O” since Google follows the alphabet for its Android updates, but today’s news is significant because Google also revealed some details of Android O. With O, Google is placing a focus on improving battery life. It’ll do this by putting new automatic limits on app background performance in three areas: implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates. Google says that these tweaks should make it so that apps “have minimal impact on a user’s device and battery.” Android O is also bringing notification tweaks. Called “notification channels”, this gives developers more control over different kinds of alerts and also gives users more fine-grained control over the notifications that they see, letting them block or change how each notification channel appears rather than simply blocking all of an app’s notifications. Other new user-facing features of Android O include picture-in-picture for watching video while you’re performing other tasks, adaptive icons that can change shapes and animate interactions based on what the device wants, and keyboard navigation that includes better “arrow” and “tab” navigation. Because this is a developer preview, Google has also announced several new dev-focused features of Android O. These include font resources in XML, wide-gamut color for apps, WebView enhancements, and AAudio API for pro audio. To go along with its announcement, Google is now offering a developer preview of Android O. This update is available for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus Player. You’re going to need to download the system image for Android O and sideload it onto your device if you want to try the preview, though. And keep in mind that this is an early preview, so you may want to avoid it unless you’re a developer. If you do want to give Android O a try, maybe load it onto a secondary device. Google says that it’ll share more details of Android O at its Google I/O conference in May.

Spanky A 6 month delay is surprisingly short. Normally, with Samsung’s already glacial pace of updates and the carriers factored in, it takes a few months longer than that. I do agree completely, though. As someone who wants prompt updates, I would never purchase an Android phone other than the Pixel. Aaron Davis No, they will see it right away. It will take 2 years for the OEMs to get their custom crap-ware working on it, before they give it to us, though. JBLmobileG1 O huh? No deserts or candy names affiliated with it? I was almost certain that they were going to use the name Oreo as the next one. :-p Trevnerdio They always release the preview as just the letter. They called Nougat “Android N” for months after it was announced. Chris Drudge Orange whip (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Whip) would be my preference, but there are other possible “O” desserts that it could be named: http://www.androidcentral.com/android-o-name None sound reasonably good other than Oreo but that would require a branding agreement with Nabisco.

Google overhauls policies after YouTube uproar Hate speech definition expanded Video Photo FILE PHOTO: A picture illustration shows a YouTube logo reflected in a person’s eye June 18, 2014. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo By Bloomberg News Mar 21, 2017 at 3:48 pm | Print View Google is giving marketers more control over their online ads after a slew of brands halted spending in the U.K. over concerns about offensive content. The Alphabet Inc. unit also expanded its definition of hate speech under its advertising policy to include vulnerable groups, which includes those discriminated against because of their identify, socioeconomic class or country of origin. The new policies apply to the YouTube online video service and Google’s expansive network that serves ads across the web. “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values. So starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a blog announcing the changes late Monday night. The moves are aimed at rebutting criticism the search giant has not done enough to curb hate speech online, but they also thrust Google further into a heated public debate over censorship and political ideologies. The new policies mark a sharp turn for Google, which has historically largely hewed to its position as a neutral host of outside sources of online content. However, as the company has grabbed a greater share of digital advertising — and bids for more television ad dollars — criticism of its stance has grown. This came to a head in recent days after the London-based Times newspaper reported ads from marquee brands in the U.K. were running with videos that promoted terrorism or anti-Semitism. Several marketers pulled their ads from Google properties in the country in response. Your next Nation & World articles Gorsuch hearings Day 3: Supreme Court pi ...

This article will appear in the Spring 2017 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Five to ten years from now, Uber hopes, the following will be an everyday occurrence: A driverless Uber car pulls up at Nick and Nicole Smith’s house at 7:30 in the morning. Their two kids, Julia, 16, and Joey, 14, hop into the car, and it then drops them off at school. The Uber car returns to the Smiths’ suburban home, picks up Nick and Nicole, and drops Nicole at the train station to catch the 7:55 into the city. The car then drives 40 minutes to drop off Nick at his company’s headquarters nestled in an office park. During the drive, Nick uses his laptop to answer emails and finish a PowerPoint. At 5:00 that afternoon, a driverless Uber car picks up Julia from field hockey practice and Joey from baseball practice and takes them home. Meanwhile, Uber has sent another car to pick up Dad at the office park at 5:30, and that car makes it to the train station in time to pick up Nicole, who’s due on the 6:15. The car then stops at a Chinese restaurant so the Smiths can pick up a takeout dinner. It waits while Nick runs in to get the food, and it then drops off the Smiths at home. Welcome to the brave new world of driverless cars and trucks. In this not-too-distant future, many Americans are likely to conclude that they no longer need—or want—to own a car. No more worrying about tune-ups or getting gas or shopping for auto insurance or renewing registrations. Uber’s controversial co-founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick, is very high on driverless technology, saying, “When there’s no other dude [i.e a driver] in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.” And Uber is far from the only player. Ford Motor and BMW say they’ll have driverless cars on the road within five years. General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft (obtaining a 10 percent stake) to help it develop driverless cars. Tesla, Volvo, Daimler, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Google, and Apple have also joined the race. And now mighty Intel, eager to get into a new, fast-growing sector, jumped into the fray in March by announcing a $15.3 billion deal to acquire Mobileye, an Israeli company that is a leader in making sensors and cameras for self-driving vehicles. Depending on how things shake out, Ford or Fiat Chrysler may own and manage self-driving fleets that compete head to head with Uber. Tony Avelar/AP Images Otto-mated: One of Otto’s self-driving, big-rig trucks leaves the garage for a test drive during a demonstration at the Otto headquarters on August 18, 2016, in San Francisco. The coming of driverless cars and trucks raises several big questions. How long will the transition to these vehicles take? What will be the benefits and the costs to society? Who will be the winners and who the losers (and it seems clear that many of the five million people who work as drivers will be losers)? And what role should the government play in managing and regulating the arrival of this new technology, or should all this be left to the free market to sort out? Also, what role should government take to help the millions of truck drivers, taxi drivers, and others who might lose their jobs, or should these displaced workers be left to fend for themselves? Should society require the winners from this new technology—most likely some giant corporations and the consuming public—to somehow share their gains with the losers, perhaps through some special levy on these new vehicles to finance programs to help the losers? The shift to driverless cars and trucks will be one of the most important new technologies since the horseless carriage replaced buggies. Yet the advent of self-driving vehicles will be different from the arrival of many previous technologies. Because we can see this technology coming years ahead of its arrival, we as a nation are in a position to take some smart policy steps to prepare and help the many people who will lose their jobs as a result of this new technology. But given America’s dismal history with easing economic transitions, such smart steps may not be taken, despite years of advance warning. Self-driving vehicles will threaten the jobs of as many as five million people—workers who make a living as taxi drivers, long-haul truckers, Uber and Lyft drivers, local delivery drivers, limo chauffeurs, and even many bus drivers. Beyond that, driverless cars could mean an end to many gas stations, auto repair shops, car washes, auto dealers, commercial parking lots, and car rental agencies, not to mention traditional auto insurance. Moreover, because this new technology will lead to a more efficient use of cars, the nation could well need fewer autos—and that could reduce overall car production. These cars will benefit the public in ways that many people don’t yet appreciate. “Most of us in the U.S. commute all alone in a single car—the average American driver spends 51 minutes to and from work every day,” says Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. “This is wasted time and wasted productivity. Driverless cars would be a big win for productivity. You can spend 45 minutes doing something productive, including taking a nap.” Rajkumar also sees a sharp drop in auto accidents. “About 1.3 million people die every year worldwide from auto accidents,” he says. “In the U.S., it’s about 38,000. Most of these accidents are caused by human error. Most of these lives would be saved with driverless technology.” Rajkumar adds that autonomous cars would be a godsend for blind, disabled, and elderly Americans who can’t drive. “These people would gain mobility,” he says. “It would greatly help the 1.5 million legally blind Americans and the more than five million disabled people who can’t drive.” Autonomous cars will make it far easier and, in theory, cheaper for many disabled people to get to work. And they will make it easier for many elderly and disabled people to go to movies or parks or shopping, and for the elderly to see their grandchildren and care for them after school. LAWRENCE KATZ, A LABOR ECONOMIST at Harvard, says there’s no denying that this radical new technology will imperil many jobs. The five million drivers who could lose their jobs, he says, represent almost 3 percent of the workforce and don’t, as a group, have bright prospects if they get laid off. “It’s disproportionately male, disproportionately non-college,” he says. Five million jobs, he explains, “is about the same size as the decline in manufacturing jobs since 2000. It’s a comparable potential shock.” The move to self-driving cars will of course produce some new jobs—in engineering, software, and marketing. But displaced former drivers generally won’t qualify for these white-collar jobs. Instead, they could find themselves with lower-paying jobs at Walmart or Target, or they could be trained for something better. According to Katz, there are two big reasons that the economic pain from losing five million driving jobs will be less than from losing five million factory jobs. First, drivers’ jobs are spread fairly evenly across the United States, while manufacturing jobs were concentrated in one devastated region, the Midwest. The more-even geographic distribution should make it easier for laid-off drivers to find jobs. Second, Katz noted, because factory workers average around $20 an hour, while drivers average $13, laid-off drivers would take less of a hit than factory workers if forced to take $10-an-hour jobs at Walmart. Still, Katz added, “This will be a shock to the labor market for non-college men. They’re already in tough shape.” Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which has 19,000 taxi, Uber, and Lyft drivers as members, shares these concerns. “Our people see this as a threat, and we know it’s closer than we realize,” she says. “These are workers on the margins, with language issues and low wages. Drivers are an older workforce. It’s people who are mainly in their forties and fifties and older. It’s going to be really hard to relocate these people within the economy.” “It’s going to be very disruptive,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. “It’s going to happen faster than a lot of people realize.” How fast will it happen? Some companies, like Uber and Ford, see driverless cars becoming popular within five years, while some skeptical experts say it will take 20 or 30 years not just to develop a truly safe self-driving technology, but also to get needed government permissions, and to overcome public anxiety that could morph into public resistance. Official Leweb Photos/Creative Commons Uber’s Travis Kalanick speaking in London.  Moody’s Investors Service predicts that self-driving technology will not become a common option in conventional vehicles until 2030, and not become standard in all vehicles until 2035. Moody’s further predicts that not until 2045 will a majority of vehicles be driverless and that by 2055, they will become nearly universal. Uber and Google have prototypes on the road now. It’s one thing, though, to have a few dozen or hundred closely supervised experimental vehicles on the road, but a very different thing to have several million self-driving cars on streets and highways across America. Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book, an auto research firm, predicted that such cars would become mainstream across America in four to ten years. But Joan Claybrook, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says it could take 10, 20, even 30 years of tinkering with and improving self-driving technology until it is truly safer than human drivers. In terms of its impact on the job market, “a huge amount depends upon the rate of change,” says David Autor, an MIT economics professor. “If this is gradual, it’s not a big deal,” he adds, explaining that if this happens over 15 or 20 years, many drivers should have time to retrain and the economy should be able to absorb them without major problems. “But if this happens overnight, it’s a very big deal.” FOR THE MOMENT, THIS technology still faces sizable hurdles. It doesn’t work when snow covers lane markers, and there’s considerable worry about what happens if the internet system controlling these cars suddenly crashes. Government approvals could be delayed for years if there are more fatalities like that of the Tesla test driver who died in May 2016 when a truck cut in front of his self-driving vehicle. To help make sure that driverless vehicles are safe, huge infrastructure spending will be needed, such as installing road signs that communicate with these vehicles and upgrading GPS systems so they are accurate to within a few inches to help self-driving cars stay in their lanes. The huge outlays needed to finance these infrastructure improvements raise concerns about cost and about fairness. Supporters of driverless cars argue that such cars will help consumers—affluent and non-affluent—because they will in theory be cheaper than using today’s taxis. In some ways, however, the public investment needed to make a nationwide system of driverless cars possible will be a subsidy for affluent families like the Smiths who will be able to afford to use them far more than poorer families. The billions that government spends on infrastructure to make driverless vehicles safe and reliable could crowd out spending for mass transit, hurting less-affluent families who rely on subways, trains, and buses. Many technology experts say major infrastructure improvements will be needed to ensure that driverless cars are safe. The electronic equipment—sensors, cameras, radar, lasers—that keeps self-driving cars from hitting other cars relies on lane markings to operate, but when there is fog or when snow covers lanes or when there is blinding glare from the sun, those sensors often can’t function. To remedy this problem, there is a push to develop a far more accurate GPS system that can locate vehicles to within four inches—helping keep them in lanes. This upgraded GPS will likely need an expensive, elaborate, and frequently updated mapping of the terrain. As a further step to ensure safety and guide these cars, industry experts are calling for a new generation of road signs and traffic lights that contain elaborate electronics to communicate with driverless cars—perhaps telling them exactly where the next exit is or warning of construction ahead or an upcoming lane merger. These infrastructure improvements will be expensive, and one can be sure that the industries rushing to introduce driverless cars will want the government to pay. In the past, the government has paid for GPS satellites and highway signs. Another infrastructure requirement: The millions of autonomous cars that will eventually be on the road will need to communicate with the cloud, and that will mean significantly expanding the capacities of the cloud. This cost is likely to be borne by companies like Uber, Google, and Ford, and not by taxpayers. Several Seconds/Creative Commons Self-driving vehicles will threaten the jobs of as many as five million people—workers who make a living as taxi drivers, long-haul truckers, Uber and Lyft drivers, local delivery drivers, limo chauffeurs, and even many bus drivers.  Brauer of Kelley Blue Book has other, nagging fears, among them that computer hackers might sabotage a car’s computer controls. For example, hackers might direct 20 driverless cars on a bridge to suddenly turn right, and they then disastrously plunge off the bridge. Or there might be an unexpected technical glitch that causes five cars to blow through an intersection and take out a group of pedestrians. Such a serious glitch or hacking incident could traumatize the public and cause regulators to delay for years giving needed government permissions. Brauer sees another obstacle to rolling out this new technology. “A lot of people won’t buy into it on a philosophy and on a trust level,” he says. That creates another challenge—many traditionalists may shun driverless cars and keep on driving their own cars. That could mean big problems meshing the supposedly safer driverless technology with cars driven by often-flawed human beings, some of whom will inevitably drive drunk or carelessly change lanes and crash into a self-driving car in their blind spot. There is also the big issue of how driverless cars should be regulated. Autonomous cars present an auto-safety issue far more momentous than the battles over airbags or cameras for when one drives in reverse. But in the face of industry eagerness and rapidly changing technology, the Obama administration punted. Without much public debate, the administration gave a fairly bright green light to driverless cars in September 2016, when the Department of Transportation issued guidelines permitting self-driving cars. These guidelines call for driverless cars to meet 15 safety standards and called for the 50 states to develop uniform regulations for these cars. There was no notice of rulemaking, and no formal set of rules. Under these guidelines, Uber, Google, Ford, and other companies could move ahead in introducing driverless cars onto the roads, without any further federal authorization needed—although the government emphasized that it would look over the companies’ shoulder and intervene if it saw safety problems with this radical new technology. In the event of safety problems arising, the government reserved the right to step in and set standards for some technologies, like electronic sensors, that autonomous cars rely on. Perhaps predictably, some auto industry executives protested that these guidelines were too strict because they raised the possibility that the government would delay or block some new self-driving technologies if it saw safety problems. Currently, the auto industry self-regulates in introducing new technologies, like automatic braking, under the belief that automakers—not wanting to hurt their image or sales—wouldn’t add a new technology unless they were convinced it was safe. But in light of the industry’s checkered history on safety, some skeptics are calling for greater regulation of self-driving vehicles. In Claybrook’s view, the Obama administration was far too hasty. “There will be some good actors and some bad actors,” she says. “The question is whether the public can rely on anything.” States have asserted some regulatory authority, but that is largely being preempted by Washington. The states will continue to be responsible for inspecting cars and licensing drivers and insurance. “The way it’s going to work,” Claybrook says, “if the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration does nothing more, the industry can do whatever it wants on driverless cars. The federal government will have opted out.” And of course the Trump administration is even less likely to intervene. TRUCKING PRESENTS A paradoxical variation on the theme. Last summer, Michael Belzer, a professor at Wayne State University and one of the nation’s leading academic authorities on the trucking industry, was predicting that self-driving trucks wouldn’t arrive for 20 years. He said in an interview back then, “The technology is just not there.” But now Belzer says self-driving trucks might arrive in ten years, perhaps sooner. This past October, Uber’s Otto subsidiary caused Belzer to shorten his timeframe when an Otto self-driving truck equipped with $30,000 in software and hardware hauled 50,000 cans of Budweiser from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs. With a human driver sitting in the cab as a backup, the truck drove 120 miles on I-25, although the human did get the truck onto the interstate and took over again before the truck exited back onto city streets. Some experts predict that self-driving trucks will become widespread before self-driving cars do, because trucking companies are so eager to cut costs and have these expensive vehicles run nearly around the clock. “The trucking industry has a huge interest in not having to pay for drivers,” Claybrook tells me. For some long-distance trucking trips, companies may cut back from two drivers in the cab to one, and there’s talk of having convoys with two or three trucks, with a driver in the front truck, and one or two autonomous trucks following right behind. “One of the big questions should be what’s going to happen to this workforce,” Belzer adds. “A lot of these drivers voted for Trump. What’s going to happen to them? Our tradition in the United States is to hell with these workers and dump them. We get rid of that work, get rid of those jobs, and you, the worker, figure out what to do.” For now at least, officials with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters aren’t voicing much alarm about the possibility of truck drivers losing jobs. The reason: Teamster officials assert that self-driving trucks will continue to need a driver to help out in case of emergencies, to handle paperwork, to assure the safety of the cargo, to pull a truck into a warehouse. An analogy is aircraft. Planes have had autopilots for generations. Today, aircraft can virtually fly themselves—and do so in bad weather. But despite futuristic projections of pilotless planes, no serious person is pushing to have commercial jetliners without human crews capable of taking the controls. Kara Deniz, a Teamsters spokesperson, says, “We don’t see anything indicating that these vehicles will be able to function in real-life conditions, go long distances, especially through a city environment, without a human being. You hear these doomsday scenarios about jobs, but there are so many questions that still need to be addressed, like not knowing the reliability and safety, and then there are hacking issues.” Sam Loesche, a Teamsters lobbyist, adds, “We have not seen a situation where any responsible operator would agree that there’s a role for this technology without an operator in the cab. Our view is [that] the best piece of safety technology is the driver.” While insisting that drivers will continue to be needed, Loesche switches gears and says that in any conversation about self-driving vehicles, “workers’ jobs need to be a top issue.” He adds, “You can’t have the number of job losses you did in other industries and not see a role for policymakers and the government.” The main industry group, the American Trucking Associations, shares some of the Teamsters’ views. Pointing to issues like hazardous cargo, driving in cities, and interacting with warehouses and stores receiving merchandise, Chris Spear, the association’s president, told a federal transportation panel in January that ATA believes drivers “will retain an important role in trucking for the foreseeable future, even with automated trucks, just as pilots are still present in airline cockpits.” State Department/Public Domain Google Co-Founder Sergey Brin shows then-Secretary of State John Kerry the sensor displays inside one of Google’s self-driving cars in Palo Alto, California.  Kalanick, Uber’s CEO, has a surprisingly optimistic—though somewhat self-contradicting—take on what driverless technology will mean for jobs. He says that in years to come, Uber will offer a mix of rides, some provided by drivers, some by self-driving cars. Kalanick foresees skyrocketing demand for improved transportation and says this would mean a continued need for drivers—for instance, to help many disabled or elderly passengers in and out of vehicles. “Many people predicted that the ATM would spell doom for bank tellers,” Kalanick says. “In fact, ATMs cut the cost of running a local bank so more branches opened, employing more people.” Kalanick adds, “Self-driving Ubers, for example, will be on the road 24 hours a day, which means they’ll need a lot more human maintenance than cars today.” NUMEROUS CORPORATIONS stand to make a fortune from this new technology, and many consumers will benefit, too. “Well-funded companies see a lot of potential revenues at the end of this rainbow, and they all want to get there first,” says Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. “There’s lots of money to be made producing the cars, controlling them, managing their data systems, and collecting information about passengers. Companies will know when he’s going, where he’s going, what he’s doing. Talk about opportunities for targeted advertising.” Once autonomous cars become popular, Brauer adds, “there will be an explosion of new business models with billions of dollars up for grabs.” With driverless cars, Uber and Lyft won’t have hard-working drivers keeping 60 percent to 80 percent of the fares. Instead, Uber and Lyft will keep the lion’s share of fares, although some might go to taxes and fees and some might go to Google or whichever company runs the driverless cars’ data systems. “Their business model would go from having huge profit potential to having massive profit potential,” Brauer says. “The fight over whether the drivers are independent contractors or employees and the related litigation, all that goes away. It becomes an extremely desirable business model.” In their book, Driverless: Intelligent Cars and the Road Ahead, Hod Lipson and Melba Kurman point to another problematic effect of driverless cars—companies and their shareholders will grow richer as drivers grow poorer. “As machines take away human jobs,” they write, “one potentially devastating effect will be to further exacerbate the trend toward inequality, a growing global problem.” AP Photo/Jared Wickerham Pit Stop: Uber testing driverless cars on Pittsburgh streets, 2016.  MIT’s Brynjolfsson argues that we as a nation should make sure we find a way to share this prosperity and progress with the displaced drivers. The most important step, he said, will be to provide first-class retraining for them. Many economists say bigger and better retraining programs will be the key, even though the nation’s retraining programs have a less-than-stellar history because they often train unemployed workers for fields where there aren’t enough job openings. Help for laid-off drivers can take many other forms, perhaps including something akin to the trade adjustment assistance received by factory workers who lose their jobs to imports. A beefed-up version would be desirable, because trade adjustment assistance has often been underfunded and has not done enough to support and retrain laid-off workers. Harvard’s Lawrence Katz offers several other suggestions: wage subsidies, an increased earned income tax credit, and, if need be, a government-backed public jobs program. (That last idea is anathema to conservatives.) A big question is where we, in tax-averse America, would find the money to finance programs to assist displaced drivers. One option would be to impose a tax on self-driving vehicles—perhaps a tax on every mile traveled. At some point, Congress could step in and tell the many corporations eager to introduce—and cash in on—this technology that it will agree to a nationwide green light for all 50 states on one condition: that it enacts a law creating a special per-mile tax to finance programs that aid and retrain displaced drivers. “Even though this may not lead to mass dislocation,” Autor says, “it may further constrict the set of opportunities for people who don’t have specialized skills. Not to say that driving doesn’t require specialized skills, but it’s not up there with engineers or computer programmers.” Autor sees demand for skilled construction workers, skilled medical technicians, and skilled repairmen as opportunities for displaced drivers. As for those who do not retrain and develop special skills, Autor says, they might have to turn to lower-paying jobs as home health aides, security guards, or food service or cleaning workers. Brynjolfsson believes laid-off drivers should be retrained for many “different kinds of jobs and industries.” Many could be trained for sales or marketing jobs, he says, adding that there are huge unmet needs, in particular, in health care and other nurturing and caring jobs. But, he acknowledges, “a lot of truck drivers aren’t going to find much of this appealing. It will be a rough transition.” America’s retraining programs have often fallen short because they failed to place workers in jobs after months or years of retraining—often because the programs ignored whether there were opportunities in the fields for which laid-off workers were being trained. While education—whether obtaining vocational training or associate’s or bachelor’s degrees—would of course help laid-off drivers, it could prove frustrating if there aren’t enough jobs out there. An ambitious program to address the nation’s urgent infrastructure problems is badly needed, and that could create a million or more construction jobs, as well as long-term jobs maintaining and operating all manner of “smart” infrastructure systems, not to mention the newfangled auto repair stations and parking lots that will be needed for company-owned fleets of driverless cars. The nation’s renewed focus on preserving and creating factory jobs could also provide valuable opportunities for laid-off drivers. And it is of course important to strive for a full-employment, higher-wage economy that offers job opportunities not just for laid-off drivers, but for everyone. This is a long-term planning challenge that goes well beyond the question of how to re-employ the upcoming wave of displaced drivers. No one should expect a seamless transition for the many drivers whose jobs get run over by driverless technology. That’s where wage subsidies, earned income tax credits, extended unemployment insurance, and some form of adjustment assistance might come into play. Some advocates argue that universal basic income would be an ideal program for drivers thrown out of work and having a hellish time finding another job. But most drivers are eager to work and probably won’t want to just get by on a modest UBI. The development of driverless cars is a perfect opportunity for some smart public policy. We as a nation have years to plan, and there will be a rich revenue stream to draw from. Let’s hope that we, the world’s richest nation, adopt some smart, foresighted policies so that millions of drivers don’t get banged up in a head-on collision when this radical new technology takes the road.     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on March 22, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: March 22, 2017 @ 9:58 am Filed Under: 24/7 OSI, Americas, Economics, Energy, English, Environment, Intelligence, Internet Communications Technology, MIL OSI, Open Source Intel, Security, United States Government, United States of America, US Amalgamated Transit Union, US Unions NEXT ARTICLE → S. 576, Follow the Rules Act ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE Intelligence and Security Bill passes third reading About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts ‘Öfisi ‘Omipatimení ko e Me’afua ki he Fakahoko Fatongia ‘a e Ngaahi Potungāue mo e Ngaahi Kautaha ‘a e Pule’angá New Zealand Employment: NZ’s investment in infrastructure creating jobs New Zealand Sport: Rugby League World Cup 2017 ANNOUNCE WOLF BLASS AS OFFICIAL WINE PARTNER Freshwater focus for World Water Day $400m Huawei investment will promote innovation and create opportunities © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

What's more, the company has also published factory images for the first Developer Preview of the new Android version. This build will not be made available through the Android Beta Program, however, it's meant only for developers to be able to get an idea of what's new. Speaking of which, let's see what Google's putting into O (which doesn't have a full name at this point, despite the entire internet wanting it to be called Android Oreo). Background limits There will be new automatic limits imposed onto apps, and specifically what they can do in the background. These should result in improved performance and battery life, while also making it easier for developers to create apps that work well and don't destroy your battery. Background limits represent a significant change in how Android works, however these will only come into effect for apps that target Android O. Notification channels and snoozing Notifications are getting a boost in Android O too. This time around developers will be able to define categories for notification content, so that users will have fine-grained control over the different kinds of notifications that each app can show. Each channel will be blockable individually, so you'll have more options than just blocking all of the notifications from a particular app. Additionally, Android O adds new grouping and visuals to notifications, making it easier to see what's going on in the notification shade at a glance. A snoozing function is in too, which gets rid of a notification for a period of time, and then shows it again. Background colors for notifications will be able to be set by developers, but only for ongoing tasks which are critical for users to see - such as driving directions. Picture-in-Picture mode, Autofill API First seen on Android TV, Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode is now a thing on phones and tablets too. So you'll be able to watch videos while doing other stuff - think about what already happens in the YouTube app when you hit Back after you start playing a video. So that, but OS-wide. The PiP windows will have support for playback controls too. Multi-display support is coming to Android as well, though the use cases for this are probably tied to Chromebooks running Android apps. O will have a system-wide Autofill API so apps such as password managers will be able to register as autofill providers and offer to be your default autofill solution. More Android O also gets font resources in XML, support for adaptive app icons, wide-gamut color for apps (think AdobeRGB, Pro Photo RGB, DCI-P3), LDAC, Wi-Fi Aware (for nearby devices to communicate via Wi-Fi without an internet access point), as well as the Telecom framework - which lets third party calling apps integrate with the system. This means your car head unit's call and reject buttons will work with third-party apps (think VoIP) too. Navigating via keyboard will be revamped for Chrome OS devices, and a new API will be out for apps that need high-performance low-latency audio. The Android Runtime should be faster than ever before, with improvements of up to 2x. Release timeline The final release of Android O is planned to hit in the third quarter of this year. Until then, there will be three more Developer Preview (DP) builds. DP2 will come in mid-to-late May, DP3 with the final APIs in mid-to-late June, and DP4 should land in mid-to-late July. Starting with DP2 you'll be able to try Android O by using the Android Beta Program too. The DP1 factory images are available for the Google Pixel, Pixel XL, and Pixel C, as well as the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus Player.

File photo by JOHN SLEEZER jsleezer@kcstar.com i By Scott Canon scanon@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Adam Kinder waited about a year the first time he signed up for Google Fiber’s faster-than-fast internet service. Liked it quite well, thank you. Then he moved and signed up again in August 2015 at his new address. Figured it wouldn’t take long to get wired. After all, his neighbors had already plugged into the search giant’s foray into fiberoptic internet hook-ups. Then, crickets. The company said it would get around to installing the service to his home … eventually. In the meantime, he bought TV and internet service from AT&T, paying a premium for month-to-month bills rather than a long-term contract because he figured Google Fiber was coming soon enough. After a time, he switched to Time Warner Cable (subsequently merged into Charter and operating now as Spectrum), still hoping he could get the faster speeds of Google Fiber. Until this month. Google wrote to Kinder, and an untold number of other customers-in-waiting across the market, that “although we’ve been working hard to bring you service, we’re unable to build our network to connect your home or business at this time.” Google refunded the $10 deposits that customers had put down, but to those like Kinder, that didn’t erase the disappointment. “I know we’re not entitled to it,” Kinder said. “But I could have made some different plans if I knew it was never going to come.” Google Fiber would take issue with “never,” but the course of its deployment in Kansas City and across the country has veered into uncertain territory. Alphabet, Google Fiber’s parent company, last month installed a new boss in its “Access” division and shifted hundreds of employees who’d been working on the home internet service at its California headquarters to other missions. The company has said it’s pulling back on hard-wire installations while it explores cheaper ways to deliver 1-gigabit-per-second speeds to home customers, including the possibility of beaming internet service over fixed wireless channels. Google purchased Webpass in June 2016 and announced in February the use of its wireless technology to sell gigabit service to apartment buildings in Denver. A Google Fiber statement about the cancellation notices to prospective customers in the Kansas City market noted wireless technology and advances in making trenches to bury fiberoptic cable as hope that deployment might pick up speed again. “In order to focus our efforts and resources, we’ll be slowing construction in some areas until we can layer in the new deployment models we’re developing,” the company said. At the same time, Google Fiber said it’s trying to round up customers now in Raymore and central Overland Park. As for the not-now notices, “We are simply telling customers we won’t be building to them in 2017 and we want to refund their deposit and let them know as opposed to making them wait.” To Roger Entner, who follows the cable and internet industries for Recon Analytics, the notices are “like when your girlfriend tells you that she needs time.” The company has long said that better internet service for customers is a boon for the advertising business that pays the bills in Mountain View. Entner said Google’s behavior suggests the company has soured on building residential internet networks itself. Instead, he believes its parent company is likely pleased that its mere presence in the business of selling internet service prompted competitors to boost upload and download speeds. AT&T, for instance, didn’t offer gigabit speeds until after Google Fiber launched. Now it sells that high-end bandwidth in 51 markets with plans to add 16 more. Indeed, most consumers in Kansas City have seen their internet speeds double, without price increases, since Google stepped into the market. This week, for instance, Comcast said that customers paying for 25 megabits-per-second would get 55 mps for the same price and those paying for 50 mps would see their speeds run to 70 megabits without a price hike. To Kinder, who’d waited years for the Google Fiber service that never came, that change in the market is his silver lining. “They made the other players step up a bit,” he said. “Now I just hope that lasts.” Dick Young waited years to get Google Fiber connected to his south Kansas City home, with only vague and frustrating answers from the company about the delay. He didn’t feel like he’d passed up on savings from other providers while waiting for the installation. But after he switched to Google Fiber, discount offers poured in. “The other guys, once we stopped them, then we got deluged with calls,” he said. “I thought, ‘Well, if you could have, you should have’ ” offered lower prices before he signed a Google Fiber contract.

Joe Tenebruso (TMFGuardian) Mar 21, 2017 at 4:48PM Many retirees shy away from tech companies -- to their own detriment. Maybe it's due to fear of a sector that, as a whole, is often considered to be higher risk than other, less dynamic industries. But there are a select few companies that, thanks to their dominant competitive advantages, offer an excellent low-risk way for investors to profit from emerging technologies. Read on to learn about one of the best. Image source: Getty Images. All hail the king Few businesses are as dominant within their respective industries as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL). The parent company of Google gives investors an opportunity beyond a core Internet search business that legendary investor Charlie Munger once described as having the largest competitive moat he's ever seen. With a more than 90% share of the global search engine market, Google is the undisputed king of search. Yet it refuses to grow complacent; it's constantly expanding its reach with an ever-growing array of services. It now possesses an incredible collection of platforms that serve more than 1 billion users each, including YouTube, Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Google Play, and now Google Cloud. Together, they serve to expand and strengthen Google's powerful ecosystem and widen its competitive moat. Moreover, Google generates enormous amounts of cash, to the tune of nearly $26 billion in 2016, which it has used to build a fortress-like balance sheet with more than $86 billion in cash and less than $4 billion in debt. This financial strength allows it to invest aggressively in research and development, and in the acquisition of companies that are leading the way in important new technologies. All of this, combined with Google's renowned culture of innovation, helps it remain at the forefront of technological change. Image source: Getty Images. Other bets It's this innovation that necessitated its reorganization into its current "Alphabet" structure. The design is brilliant, as it sends a clear message about what the company has become: a collection of businesses with investments in a far-ranging array of exciting technologies that are poised to pay increasing returns to shareholders in the years ahead. Alphabet's holding company structure allows disparate businesses -- such as self-driving technology leader Waymo, life sciences company Verily, and connected home device maker Nest -- to be run and scaled independently. Management believes this will give these "other bets" their best chance at receiving the resources and attention they need to succeed over the long term.  Alphabet therefore gives investors many ways to win. The company's core Google business is as dominant as they come, which helps to lower Alphabet's overall risk profile. And the company's other bets have in many ways become analogous to an emerging technology fund overseen by two of the greatest minds on the planet: co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. It's the perfect balance of market dominance and optionality; cash flow and reinvestment opportunity; current success and future growth potential. Valuation At first glance, Alphabet's forward price-to-earnings ratio in the low 20's may seem a bit expensive compared to the S&P 500's forward P/E of about 18. But if you adjust for the more than $82 billion in net cash it has on its balance sheet -- which equates to about $119 per share -- Alphabet's ex-cash P/E drops to less than 19. On that basis, Alphabet's stock is quite a bargain, especially considering its superior growth rates compared to the market as a whole. Moreover, investors who buy shares today will be buying alongside Alphabet itself. The company has a $7 billion share repurchase program currently under way -- a figure that's likely to continue to grow along with Alphabet's ever rising cash flows. These share buybacks should further help to support Alphabet's stock price, and they signal management's increasing willingness to return capital to shareholders. All told, Alphabet offers retirees an excellent and relatively low-risk way to profit from emerging technologies -- a high potential field that's often underrepresented in retirement portfolios.

Jigsaw, a research arm of Google parent company Alphabet, says that free and fair elections depend on access to information. To ensure such access, Jigsaw says, sites for news, human rights and election monitoring need to be protected from cyberattacks. Jigsaw’s set of tools, called Protect Your Election, is mostly a repackaging of existing programs: • Project Shield will help websites guard against denial-of-service attacks, in which hackers flood sites with so much traffic that legitimate visitors can’t get through. Users of Project Shield will be tapping technology and servers that Google already uses to protect its own sites from such attacks. • Password Alert is software that people can add to Chrome browsers to warn them when they try to enter their Google password on another site, often a sign of a phishing attempt. • 2-Step Verification helps beef up security beyond passwords by requiring a second access code, such as a text sent to a verified cell phone. Though Jigsaw directs users to turn this on for Google accounts, most major rivals offer similar protections, too. “This is as much an occasion to have a conversation about digital security as it is putting all the tools in one place,” Jigsaw spokesman Dan Keyserling said. While the tools can be useful to a variety of groups and individuals, Jigsaw says it is focusing on elections because cyberattacks often increase against news organizations and election information sites around election time. In particular, Jigsaw wants to help sites deploy the tools ahead of the French presidential elections, which begin April 23. The tools are free, though Project Shield is limited to news organizations, individual journalists, human-rights groups and election-monitoring organizations. It’s not known whether the tools might have prevented some of the high-profile attacks in the past, including the theft of emails from Democratic Party computers during the 2016 presidential campaign. The tools do not directly address such break-ins, but they could help guard against password stealing, a common precursor to break-ins. Anick Jesdanun is an Associated Press writer.

Shortcuts icons link to information with a tap. Photo: Associated Press Google to offer Shortcuts to information on phones 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Google wants to make it easier for you to find answers and recommendations on smartphones without having to think about what to ask its search engine. Its new feature, called Shortcuts, will appear as a row of icons below the Google search box. Instead of having to ponder and then speak or type a request, the Shortcuts will let you tap the icons to get the latest weather, movie showtimes, sports scores, restaurant recommendations and other common requests. The Shortcuts began appearing Tuesday in updates to Google’s app for iPhones, Android phones and its mobile website. The Android app will also include various tools such as a currency converter, a language translator and an ATM locator, which you can also summon with a tap. Those tools may eventually make it to the iPhone as well, although Google says it doesn’t know when. The changes are the latest step in Google’s quest to turn its search engine into a secondary brain that anticipates people’s needs and desires. The search engine gleans these insights by analyzing past requests and, when people allow it, tracking locations, a practice that periodically raises privacy concerns about Google’s power to create digital profiles of its users. Based on the knowledge that Google already has accumulated, its Shortcuts feature may already list a user’s favorite sports teams or recommend nearby restaurants serving their preferred cuisines. Shortcuts also show how Google’s search engine has been adapting to its audience, now that smartphones have become the primary way millions of people stay connected to the internet. Since more than half of requests for Google’s search engine now come from smartphones, the Mountain View company has adapted its services to smaller screens, touch-keyboards and apps instead of websites. Early in that process, Google programmed its search engine to answer many requests with factual summaries at the top of its results page, a change from simply displaying a list of links to other websites. Voice-recognition technology also allows you to speak a request into a phone instead of typing it. The transition is going well so far. Google’s revenue rose 20 percent last year to $89 billion, propelled by digital ads served up on its search engine, YouTube and Gmail. Although Shortcuts won’t initially show ads after you tap them, Google typically sells marketing space if a feature or service becomes popular. Michael Liedtke is an Associated Press writer.

After a bit of research, Google found that users were hitting the bottom of the page looking for more to read. To fix that, you guessed it, Google is packing in the stories. With many content publishers supporting AMP (including DL), stories and media load quickly through this app, meaning you can read all of the important info without waiting. As the app’s name suggests, you can also check your weather forecast. If you need all those headlines, be on the lookout for the update to hit your phone this week.

The British government has suspended its advertising on YouTube after some public sector ads appeared next to videos carrying homophobic and anti-semitic messages, prompting a flood of major companies to follow suit. Marks & Spencer, Vodaphone, Sky and several leading high street banks were the latest in a string of firms to pull the plug on their Google advertising. We take responsibility At the annual Advertising Week Europe event in London on Monday March 20, Matt Brittin, Google’s head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said: “You have probably read stories about brands appearing next to content. I want to start by saying sorry and we take responsibility for it”. He said the company was working on ways to improve its ad placement system, admitting: “Clearly we need to do more on that.” But he would not say if it would actively seek out inappropriate material on its sites. Sir Martin Sorrell, founder and chief executive of WPP, which is the world’s largest advertising firm, feels Google should do more. He said: “They can’t sit there and say we are digital engineers and are not responsible. They are responsible and get on and accept it and police it properly.” “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company. They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements,” Sorrell added. Duty of care French advertising giant Havas, whose UK clients include O2, EDF and Royal Mail, was the first to temporarily withdraw its advertising from YouTube and Google on Friday March 17. The company is reported to spend about 201.6 euros million annually on digital advertising. Havas made the decision after talks with Google bore little fruit. Britain’s Guardian newspaper quoted the company’s UK chief executive, Paul Frampton, as saying Google had been: “Unable to provide specific reassurances, policy and guarantees that their video or display content is classified either quickly enough or with the correct filters”. “We have a duty of care to our clients in the UK marketplace to position their brands in the right context where we can be assured that that environment is safe, regulated to the degree necessary and additive to their brands’ objectives. Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network’s ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect,” he added. At the advertising industry event on Monday, Michael Roth, CEO of Interpublic Group said: “It is important they make a concerted effort that the adverts are not presented next to offensive material.” Havas freezes all Google and YouTube ad spend in the U.K. as the war on digital flares up https://t.co/Y1MUXu9GSq pic.twitter.com/u5erw0SqM6— Ad Age (@adage) March 20, 2017 Clicks mean cash The proceeds from the ads literally lines hate preachers’ pockets with every 1,000 clicks bringing them about seven euros. Other beneficiaries reportedly included a controversial Islamist preacher banned from the UK. In a letter to Google, Yvette Cooper, who chairs the UK Home Affairs Select Committee, accused the company of “profiting from hatred”. Google has been called to the UK Cabinet Office for a second time and will appear later this week following reports that UK government adverts had also appeared next to ‘inappropriate material’. Temporary restriction A government spokeswoman said: “Digital advertising is a cost-effective way for the government to engage millions of people in vital campaigns such as military recruitment and blood donation. “Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content. We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way. “Google has been summoned for discussions at the Cabinet Office to explain how it will deliver the high quality of service government demands on behalf of the taxpayer.” Given that the bulk of Google’s 69.7 billion euros revenue in 2015 came from its proprietary advertising service, Google AdWords, it certainly seems to be in the company’s best interests to heed calls for an overhaul in its advertising practices. Who has paused their ads? The companies include O2, EDF, Royal Mail, Vodafone, Sky, HSBC, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, McDonald’s, L’Oréal, Audi, Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s, Argos, the BBC, the Guardian and the British government.

 Google beat Apple in education, one of its oldest strongholds — but now it's time for round two Kif Leswing Mar. 21, 2017, 4:09 PM 3,707 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Over the past few years, Apple, which was synonymous with educational technology, has seen its foothold in the classroom slip. In 2013, iPhones, iPads, and Macs made up half of devices sold to American classrooms. Now, Apple products are in third place — behind Google's Chromebooks and Microsoft Windows, according to a Futuresource Consulting estimate. Apple's announcement on Tuesday, in which it introduced a new low-cost iPad starting at $329, could change that trend, analysts told Business Insider. Some online joked that Apple should call it the iPad "education edition," partially because it's priced at $70 less than the iPad Air 2 it replaced.   "I’d guess education will play a heavy focus for this product," Futuresource analyst Mike Fisher said. "I think education is a big motivation," Geoff Blaber, vice president of research at CCS Insight, said. "When you’re buying in bulk, price will be a huge factor in education, and that’s where Apple needs to compete more aggressively with Google." The education market is only a fraction of the larger PC and tablet market. But it's seen as important because students who become used to a platform in school might be more likely to continue using the same computers when they graduate. "We’re incredibly passionate about education," Apple's VP of product marketing Susan Prescott told the New York Times earlier this month.  But will a lower price be enough to turn around Apple's fortunes in the classroom?  Futuresource Consulting Buying in bulk Logitech's new iPad case targeted at schools. Logitech Even at $330, or even possibly lower thanks to an educational discount, the new iPad isn't going to be the low-cost option for school districts. But it does represent a better value after the price cut.  "Its obviously positive, but it doesn’t totally overcome the pricing gap," Fisher said. "Apple will remain a ‘premium’ product." After the price cuts, Blaber said, the iPad is "vastly more competitive against Chromebook. But that said, it’s necessary to say that Apple still faces some pretty significant competition." For example, he points out, "with volume, you can get Chromebooks under the $200 price point." 2-in-1 devices running Windows, which can be transform into both a tablet and a laptop could cost less than $300, Fisher said. Apple is unlikely to ever beat low-cost computer makers, especially when Google and Microsoft give their operating systems away for free or for very low cost — which means it'll have to beat its rivals on experience in the classroom.  Another issue facing the iPad is that it doesn't come with a keyboard, which is required by many school districts for standardized tests. It's a trend that once elicited one of the most annoyed public comments from Apple CEO Tim Cook ever: He called Chromebooks mere "test machines" in an interview from 2015. Apple's low-cost iPad doesn't have a keyboard case, unlike its $599 iPad Pro — too expensive for schools — but third-party casemakers are already filling the gap.  Choosy parents choose... iPad? Getty/Mario Tama To get more schools to choose Apple products, Apple has to clearly state the value of the iPad in the classroom — which isn't easy when some teachers have said that iPads "provide no educational function in the classroom."  Apple has clearly been making moves — last year it bought LearnSprout, an education-technology startup. Last summer, it also launched Classroom, software that allows teachers to track an entire classroom on their progress.  And on Tuesday, Apple announced that its acclaimed programming tutorial program, Swift Playgrounds, is newly available in five new languages. Apple has also been running Apple Teacher, a program to train teachers how to best use Apple products in the classroom.  Even that might not be enough though, analysts say. Google has similar classroom software, and it's easier to manage a fleet of Chromebooks. "It's not just about pricing either, it's all about the ecosystem and Google ecosystem has just gained real momentum," Fisher said, pointing to software like GSuite, Google Classroom, and its management console. "To a large extent globally, rather than just the US, there’s still an awful lot of experimentation for schools, and in education broadly, to get a grasp on which OS is most appropriate," Blaber said. "The base level, both [iPads and Chromebooks] are very competitive. It's also worth noting that Windows has had excellent classroom and fleet management tools for years.  It's also possible that iPads may make inroads into school districts that don't issue their students laptops, but rather let them choose their own.  "Apple is getting pretty aggressive with iPad pricing. Smart and offering a direct to .edu price at $299 is a shot at Chromebooks," Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin tweeted. "[Bring your own device] in lower education grades is a growing trend. New iPad pricing makes this an interesting choice for parents vs. Chromebooks." Get the latest Google stock price here.

The new iteration of Google's mobile operation system, which will likely power the next generation of Android smartphones and tablets, is simply known as "Android O." Google's vice president of engineering Dave Burke detailed some of the changes that developers and consumers can expect from the Android O release, which probably won't be available to consumers until next fall. "Android O puts a big priority on improving a user's battery life and the device's interactive performance," Burke explained in a blog post. Burke said a new function in Android O allows the operating system to limit what sorts of things applications can do in the background, resulting in battery life savings for the end user. Android O will also add Picture in Picture support, a feature Apple already offers on its iPad tablets. Google says it will also be available for phones, however, and will allow folks to watch movies or other video clips while performing other activities, like checking email or surfing the web. The Android O Developer Preview is available now. Expect to hear more about Google's next operating system, perhaps even its official name, during Google I/O 2017 in mid-May. Until then, it's time to play the perennial guessing game about the operating system's eventual name. Google released Android N around the same time last year before it eventually revealed the name "Android Nougat" last June. What will Google O be called?

Just like it did with Android N, which went on to become Android Nougat, this preview is starting earlier than Android iterations that came before. Most notable in the new software is its emphasis on efficiency. “Background limits” is a new feature in O and it looks to accomplish for your battery what Data Saver did for your wireless plan bill. The goal is to make apps, both old and new, less taxing on your battery by making the limits more transparent for developers. If it works well in the final release, this is one of those features that could be big for supported devices. Next up is picture-in-picture (PIP), which is rather self-explanatory. This allows users to continue watching a video while executing a totally different task. It’s an extension of the split window feature, but lets you get a full view so that multitasking offers more immersion and less compromise. Notifications are also receiving some useful updates. Many will find it useful that notifications can be snoozed for a later time and the background color of each type is adjustable so that you know what's what at a glance. What else is new? As we move into the 3.5mm-less future (sadness), Google is one step ahead in Android O with support for the LDAC Bluetooth codec. It was created by Sony and although we've yet to see the codec blossom outside of that company's own lineup of audio products, it definitely has potential to do so. (Enough so for Google to implement it in O, at least.) Though most of what the first Android O dev preview has to offer is, unsurprisingly, angled toward developers, there are a few other tidbits to get consumers excited. Google has introduced adaptive icons for OEMs to use in Android O in hopes of achieving greater consistency in the visual look of all app icons from the Play Store. This new update in the back-end also adds animation support to all app icons. If developers have adopted the template, it will give a little happy jiggle when you interact with it. Of the new things we do know about Android O, what we don't know is what it will be called. Oreo? Orbit? Orange? We might have to wait until Google IO 2017 to find out. The first developer preview is likely to be very unstable and is targeted, in Google's words, towards developers only. As such, you won't get the OTA update for O through Android Beta Program. You'll have to do everything manually. Download it here at your own risk.

We’ve gotten numerous battery-improving additions to Android over the years which have helped devices deliver better battery life than ever before. But that’s only on Google’s side. Battery drain could still be possible thanks to things like rogue apps which use way more resources than they are supposed to. Facebook is a perennially notorious offender of this (which is a sad fact considering they’re supposed to have world-class developers, but we digress). Thankfully, though, Google has found a way to sort of force developers’ apps to play nicely in Android O by limiting apps’ capabilities depending on what state they’re in. Say, for instance, you “close” Facebook. Prior to Android O, Facebook could still run background services to have its app ping the servers to check for new messages or notifications. While this is normally not an issue, sometimes an app can go haywire during this process and eat up precious system resources even when there is no reason to. In Android O, this is being addressed by apps having their background status revoked a few minutes after the app is closed. Instead, developers now need to set their server checks up as a scheduled job, so the system can handle that particular job in a more efficient way and ensure it can’t interfere with other background apps or execute more tasks than it needs to. Again, good developers already develop their apps in a way to ensure they’re not encroaching on your device’s resources unnecessarily, but for the few which don’t, this keeps them in line. Apps can be placed on a “whitelist,” of sorts, when they need to create a background service during special events, such as responding to an incoming SMS/MMS broadcast. To go further with it, Google is also making a change to the way broadcast listeners are registered. In non-developer speak, the system can “broadcast” certain events, such as when the phone is charging or when a call is incoming. Apps can “listen” for these broadcasts to perform some action when they get the signal. In the case of, say, Netflix, it may not allow you to download movies for offline viewing unless you’re charging your phone and on a WiFi network. The problem pre-Android O is that if you have multiple apps all listening for the same events and attempting to act on those events at the same time, it could cause trouble. With Android O, event responses are now handled as scheduled jobs, so Android can queue up each task and schedule them accordingly to ensure no one steps on each others’ toes. Similar changes are coming to location updates for those who rely on GPS-enabled apps. As a foreground app (mostly ones that you are actually running or that forces itself into the foreground by, say, putting a persistent notification in your tray) they have free reign just as they did on Android N, but with Android O, location updates in the background can only be requested a few times per hour, an interval which Google is still tuning but likely won’t change too extremely in either direction. Think of it all as that intimidating teacher you had on exams day. When class is just getting started and everyone is settling in, go nuts. But when she starts to pass out those test sheets, she’s going to keep her eye on everyone to make sure they’re doing what they’re supposed to be doing and not cheating the system. These apps with background services are like the students, and the Android job scheduler is the teacher who keeps them all in line. We should note that these new behavioral changes will only apply to apps targeting Android O or higher, though getting developers to make that jump shouldn’t be an issue as they’ll likely want to access all the cool new stuff Android O will enable them to do. local_offer    Android O   battery life   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (4) stars Further Reading Android O Hands-on Sony helped Google improve Bluetooth audio quality in Android O Android O has a new Ambient Display lockscreen [VIDEO] Android O snooze notifications How to install Android O Dev Preview stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertFunny video shows frustrations with Google Home closeThis video perfectly shows why you shouldn’t waste your money on Google Home Google Home has been out for a little over 6 months now, but it seems the product is still a bit half-baked.

Android O is official! Google today announced a developer preview of Android O, the next major release of its mobile operating system. The preview is available for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus Player. You’re going to have to put in some work if you want to install the update, because Google is only offering the preview as a file that you can download and flash. There’s no OTA update available yet. As for what’s included in Android O, there’s a big focus here on battery life improvements. Google is putting more automatic limits on what apps can do in the background when it comes to implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates. The goal here is to put limits on what apps can do while they’re running in the background, meaning that they’re less likely to hog performance and your battery life when you’re not using them. Android O is also adding notification channels, which give developers better control over different kinds of notifications. This then lets users change the behavior of each notification category, giving them more fine-grained control over an app’s alerts. Android O also includes better visuals and groupings for notifications. Picture-in-picture mode is coming with Android O, too. As its name suggests, this feature lets you continue watching video on your phone or tablet while you’re doing things outside of that video app. Also included here is multi-display support for launching apps on a remote display. With Android O, Google is also letting developers create adaptive icons. These app icons can be displayed in different shapes based on the mask chosen by the phone. These adaptive icons can also be animated. Google is placing more of a focus on keyboard navigation with Android O, as well, building a more reliable model for using the arrow and tab keys to navigate the OS. Also included with Android O are autofill APIs. This feature should make it easier to use apps that autofill fields of information, like password apps. Other developer-focused features of Android O include font resources in XML, wide-gamut color for apps, AAudio API for pro audio, WebView enhancements, and Java 8 language APIs and runtime optimizations. Google will share more details about Android O at Google I/O in May. There aren’t a ton of new user-facing features that’ve been announced for Android O yet, but that’s because it’s still in an early developer preview. What we do know so far makes the update sound nice, though. Battery life is one of those things that most every smartphone user wishes were better, so it’s good to hear that Google is focusing more on that issue with Android O. We’ll have to wait for the update to be released before we see exactly how much battery life these background app limits give us, though. If you’re a developer that’s interested in giving Android O a try right now, you can find the images available for download right now. If you’re a normal user, you may want to hold off on installing this release, at least when it comes to your daily driver.

The Android parent is expected to refresh its tablet offering lineup this year with Nexus 7 (2017). Seeing as two months have already passed since 2017 started, it means that Google is getting closer to unveil the device. Even though Google has yet to confirm that Nexus 7 (2017) is indeed coming, the entire Android community keeps on speculating about it. The reason why this tablet is so highly anticipated is because it’s expected to ship with Andromeda OS instead of Android OS. Google Nexus 7 (2017): Operating System Even though the entire Android community is highly enthusiastic about this new operating system, Google’s Android Senior Vice President said that it doesn’t exist. According to rumors, Andromeda OS is the result of the combination between Android OS and ChromeBook OS. Sadly, Hiroshi Lockheimer announced that Android and Chrome will never merge together. This means that Andromeda OS was a rumor all along. On the other hand, this means that Nexus 7 (2017) is going to run on Android OS. We can be more than sure that it’s going to ship with Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box if not better. Google has yet to confirm the official launch date for Nexus 7 (2017) so we can’t know what operating system version will be live during that period in order to make a correct prediction. Google Nexus 7 (2017): Hardware Specs As previously mentioned, Nexus 7 (2017) is the most talked about tablet in the Android community therefore we already have an idea of what’s expected of it. First off, the tablet will be powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 processor. This is the best mobile chipset available on the market right now and it’s definitely going to give Nexus 7 (2017) an edge over its competition. In addition, Google will pair the processor with 4GB RAM and 64GB of on-board storage space. From what we can tell right now, Google is more than surely going to take the market by storm when Nexus 7 (2017) comes out. Also, taking in consideration that Google hasn’t refreshed its tablet offering for a while now we can be sure that all Android fans will flock over to it.

The Chinese manufacturer always makes sure that its clients are happy and that’s why OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T have recently received Android 7.1.1 Nougat. What’s surprising is that while all of this was happening, Nexus 6 that’s directly managed by Google itself has received a downgrade back to Android 7.0 Nougat. It doesn’t really makes sense that OnePlus is rolling out Android 7.1.1 Nougat while Google is downgrading Nexus 6P but there’s actually a good reason behind this. We’ll go over it right now. Nexus 6 is Downgraded Back to Android 7.0 Nougat The smartphone has received Android 7.1.1 Nougat a while ago and it all worked fine until the Android parent decided to start rolling out March’s security bulletin. This is when things started to look bad for Nexus 6. Instead of enhancing the smartphone’s security, the security patch actually meddled with the device’s Android Pay feature and disabled it. Google was then forced to downgrade Nexus 6’s operating system so that Android Pay can function. Although this is quite annoying for Nexus 6 owners, Google has guaranteed that Nexus 6’s operating system will be brought back to Android 7.1.1 Nougat in the not so faraway future. OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T Receive Android 7.1.1 Nougat As previously mentioned, the Chinese manufacturer is known for putting a high price on customer feedback. OnePlus has promised its fan base a while ago that Android 7.1.1 will be coming and it looks it kept true to its word. Therefore, OnePlus 3 and 3T have received OxygenOS 4.1 that’s been built around Android 7.1.1 Nougat. The update is being rolled out OTA (over the air) and it should arrive any moment now. Although, OnePlus is rolling out this major operating system update to only 10,000 randomly selected devices each day. That’s why not all OnePlus 3 and 3T owners will receive the update at the same time. Nonetheless, we advise OnePlus 3 and 3T owners to keep their eyes peeled at their notification panel because OxygenOS 4.1 should pop-up anytime now. This update can be considered as being quite important since it completely enhances the way both smartphones function.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ENTREPRENEUR Hybrid cloud storage company Avere Systems raises $14 million from Google, Western Digital, others Paul Sawers@psawers March 21, 2017 1:00 PM Tags: Avere Systems, funding daily, Google, Western Digital Above: Avere Systems Avere Systems, a hybrid cloud data storage company based in Pittsburgh, has closed a $14 million series E round of funding from new investor Google, in addition to existing investors Menlo Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Tenaya Capital, and Western Digital Capital. Founded in 2008, Avere Systems helps enterprises establish a system that blends on-premises and public cloud data storage, and offers a mix of software and hardware-based services. While countless companies have already migrated to the cloud, enabling a scalable data storage system that grows and contracts based on demand, there are benefits to keeping some things “in-house” — it enables faster data-transfer speeds, for starters, and it can often be better for privacy. So with “hybrid,” some tasks can be managed on-premises, while other tasks — particularly ones that may require significant computer resources — can be managed in the public cloud. A recent report by Gartner suggested that the global public cloud services market alone would grow to nearly $250 billion in 2017, a rise of 18 percent. Before now, Avere had raised $83 million, including $15 million back in 2009, $17 million a year later, and its last tranche of $20 million back in 2014. Its latest cash influx will be used to “expand the company’s hybrid cloud product offerings so that more organizations can easily take advantage of the public cloud,” according to a company statement. “For the last several years, we’ve been laser-focused on expanding our product offerings to help customers overcome their biggest infrastructure challenge — embracing the cloud,” explained Ron Bianchini, president and CEO of Avere Systems. “In 2016 alone, Avere has grown its cloud business by 97 percent, nearly doubling growth from the previous year, and closed the year with cloud offerings driving close to half of our annual bookings. This latest investment is a testament to our momentum, the strength of our partnerships, and the hard work our team has dedicated to delivering innovative solutions.” It’s worth taking a closer look at the investors in this round, too. Notably, Google Inc., as opposed to its dedicated investment arms GV (Google Ventures) and CapitalG (Google Capital), invested directly in Avere Systems. Google itself isn’t renowned for its direct investments, though it does have some form on that front — it has previously invested in SpaceX, Magic Leap, Zynga, Tesla, and about 50 other companies. For context, GV has made around 470 investments, and CapitalG has made around 35 investments — but the latter was only set up in 2013. That Google has elected to invest directly in Avere Systems, rather than channeling the funds via one of its VC arms, suggests that Google isn’t primarily motivated by direct financial gains through holding equity in Avere — that is what its investment divisions are for. Instead, it sees a direct and immediate synergy between the two companies. Indeed, Google is competing against some titans in the cloud computing space, including Amazon and Microsoft, while Avere Systems already supports the Google Cloud Platform (as well as Amazon Web Services) as part of its hybrid cloud offering. This partnership has been in place since 2015, and the following year Avere was actually named Google’s top Cloud Platform technology partner, highlighting the close-knit technical integrations between the two companies. Investing in a close technical partner could be a way for Google to gain some influence over the future direction of Avere as Google looks to support the hybrid cloud with many of its own enterprise clients. Or, somewhat less likely, it could be a precursor to an acquisition. But most importantly here, the investment serves as a timely reminder of the importance of the cloud in Google’s business strategy. It’s also worth noting that data storage giant Western Digital also participated in this round via its venture capital arm, having led on the $20 million funding round from 2014. Again there are deep synergies between Western Digital and Avere Systems, so there is scope there also for closer ties in the future.

Google is all about making it as easy as possible to get the answers you need. Along those lines, you now may be able to find the information you're looking for via the Google app without having to type anything into the search bar. The Web giant today added a number of handy shortcuts to its app for Android and iOS and Google.com that surface local dining options, offer easy access to the weather, sports scores, TV listings, and more. To see what's available, just make sure your Google app is updated to the latest version then look for your shortcuts underneath the search box. "The Google search box is great when you're looking for a specific answer, but there are also moments when you just want to catch up on the latest for topics of interest," Google's Vice President of Product Management Tamar Yehoshua wrote in a blog post. "Need to know whether to bring a raincoat tomorrow? Want the score to last night's basketball game? Looking for what's on TV tonight or who's nominated for best supporting actress? Shortcuts on Google will get you there." For a peek at the new shortcuts, check out the video below. Related 21 Google Search Tips You Need to Learn 21 Google Search Tips You Need to Learn Just tap on the entertainment shortcut, for instance, to see what's playing at your local theater or what's on TV. Looking for something to eat for lunch or dinner? Tap the eat & drink shortcut to view nearby dining options and recommendations. Yehoshua said this is "the easiest way to uncover nearby must-try spots while you're out and about." The sports shortcut delivers the game times, scores, and news, and you can customize it for your favorite teams (plus the ones you root against). The weather tab displays hourly sky conditions, the chance of rain, severe weather alerts, and a detailed 10-day forecast. Android users, meanwhile, have access to "dozens" of other shortcuts, including translate, nearby attractions, flights, hotels, an internet speed test, currency converter, and more. There's also shortcuts like tic-tac-toe, roll a die, animal sounds, solitaire, and Google favorite I'm feeling curious.

Google has become a global advertising behemoth, pocketing billions of dollars every year from brands promoting their goods through the company's search engine and on YouTube. But the changes, which will be introduced in the coming weeks, highlight the difficult balance between protecting Google's advertising business while also allowing free speech. By giving brands greater say over where their ads appears, experts say, Google is acknowledging that it has not done enough so far to police the material on its sites. "Recently, we had a number of cases where brands' ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologize," Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, said in a blog post Tuesday. "We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us." Google's efforts to clean up its act show how dependent it remains on online advertising, despite the large bets its parent company, Alphabet, has made on other technologies, such as driverless cars and health care. Last year, Alphabet made $19.5 billion US in net profit, a 23 per cent annual jump, almost all of which was generated from Google's advertising business. Google's public mea culpa follows the pulling of ads by Havas, a French advertising multinational. Havas withdrew spots for several of its clients from the search giant's digital services in Britain after failing to receive assurances that they would not be shown next to offensive material. As part of the advertising revamp, Google said that it would rigorously vet online content that could be considered hate speech or derogatory content. That would include giving brands greater say over where their ads would be shown online and powers to remove them if companies were still not satisfied. The company said that it would hire more staff members to police its advertising standards, adding that it would also use artificial intelligence and other technology to remove harmful content. "We believe the combination of these new policies and controls will significantly strengthen our ability to help advertisers," Schindler said. Google refrained, however, from saying that it would actively remove material before it had been flagged by users, a move that some policy-makers, notably in Europe, have called for. Google's stance has come under increased scrutiny in recent months with the rise of so-called fake news and with hate speech connected to elections in the United States and Europe, among others. Some freedom of speech campaigners have urged Google to stand its ground, but policy-makers around the world have called on the company to do more to combat the spread of offensive material on the Internet.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Thursday, March 23, 2017 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? Policy Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? By Jeneba Ghatt - 2:30pm July 18, 2011 14900 78 SHARE Facebook Twitter For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google’s latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project. It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

Google Officially Introduces First Android O Developer Preview GO The Developer Preview is available for download Mar 21, 2017 18:58 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Today, Google launched the very first Android O Developer Preview, making the version available for download. The release is aimed at developers and Google specifies that it’s not intended for daily or consumer use. It’s worth mentioning that Android O Developer Preview packs lots of bugs and various stability issues, as expected. The new version can be installed on Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, and Nexus Player. Google made the Developer Preview system images available, together with Release Notes that contain additional information on the new Android OS version. The tech giant also mentions that some apps may not function properly and that battery life may be regressed for screen-on and screen-off use cases. A number of new features were announced Google detailed several new features that developers will find in the first Android O preview. Therefore, this version comes with background limits, which will allow users to improve their phone’s battery life and the device’s interactive performance. As expected, Google brought notification channels, which are new “app-defined categories for notification content.” It will give developers the option to control different kinds of notifications, and users the ability to block or change the behavior of each channel individually. New visuals and grouping tools were also added. Moreover, this version introduces new autofill APIs for apps to store and secure data per user request. Picture-in-picture display was made available on phones and tablets so users can work on multiple apps at the same time. Google also added a new app overlay window and multi-display support for launching an activity on a remote display. Another change is adaptive icons that are displayed in different shapes, based on user preference. Connectivity options for Bluetooth and WiFi were also added, together with wide-gamut color for app developers. This release is mainly targeted at developers, while a stable version of Android O is expected to be announced later this year, after a number of developer previews are released.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (3 Images) #Google#Android O#Developer Preview#Nexus 5X#Pixel XL subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (3 Images) 01 02 03 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Android O Could Feature Notification Revamp and Picture-in-Picture Google May Have a Third Smartphone in the Works Under Codename “Taimen” Android Distribution Numbers Confirm Nougat Doubles Its Market Share in a Month Android O Could Bring New Gestures and Improved Messaging Features Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook New Galaxy S8 and S8+ Press Shots Surface, Together with Official Teaser Super Mario Run is Now Officially Available on Android Phones Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Google Updates Duo With Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Target to Offer Freebies for Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders, Leaked Ad Shows 3 photos    Official Android O logo new android apps Universal TV Remote Control APK: Updated March 23rd, 13:50 GMT Pokémon Duel APK: Updated March 23rd, 13:46 GMT BLEACH Brave Souls APK: Updated March 23rd, 13:44 GMT Props APK: Updated March 23rd, 13:41 GMT Birthday APK: Updated March 23rd, 13:36 GMT Music APK: Updated March 23rd, 13:24 GMT Space APK: Updated March 23rd, 13:15 GMT Reader comments Target to Offer Freebies for Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders, Leaked Ad Shows more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Because the Android Beta Program delivered the update over-the-air, all you had to do was enroll on their site and wait for notification to appear on your device. It didn’t get much easier than that. This year Google is taking things a little slower with Android O. Although the Android O Developer Preview is officially hitting the streets today, it’s mostly meant for developers to get a head start on getting their apps up to speed and provide feedback before the final version of Android O debuts later this year (Q3). The Developer Preview is only available via factory images and you’ll need to flash them the old fashioned way in order to get the early alpha software up and running on your Nexus or Pixel device. It’s really not meant for use on a primary Android device as, again, the software is still in an extremely early state. So early in fact, there’s still a good few months before Android O will be available in public beta. For those wondering when the Android O Beta will be released, Google has provided a timeline on their site, showing an ETA somewhere between May and June. That’s when Developer Preview 2 will drop and it seems the beta will be available as well, providing there aren’t any delays like we saw last year with Android N. Preview 1 (initial release, alpha) Preview 2 (incremental update, beta) Preview 3 (final APIs and official SDK, Play publishing) Preview 4 (near-final system images for final testing) Final release to AOSP and ecosystem Installing the Android O Beta Once the update is available via the Android Beta Program, all you’ll have to do is: Visit g.co/androidbeta Choose Pixel/Nexus devices you’d like to enroll in the beta Check your device for “System Update” notification Download the update (use WiFi to speed things up) Install the update Wait for Pixel/Nexus to reboot Enjoy Android O! Un-enrolling is just easy, but your device will be reset to a factory state, meaning you’ll have to start over fresh like the first day you took it out of the box.

Top features explained What's new in the Android O Developer Preview? Top features explained by Chris Smith 21 March 2017 0 shares Read Comments Google has announced the developer preview of Android O, the eventual successor to the current Android Nougat OS. The release comes almost a year to the day since Android N was announced and the first version will be available to registered developers today. Although it's early days with Android O, with plenty more features still to come, Google has announced a laundry list of new tools, some of which you may recognise from a leak last week. Google says an Android O “deep dive” at Google I/O in May will expand on today’s announcement. No news yet on when it gets a proper name. So, here are the top features: Background Limits Google is continuing the efforts to maximise battery life that began with Android Nougat. It says it has put additional automatic limits on what apps can do in the background in a number of key areas (broadcasts, background services, location updates). “These changes will make it easier to create apps that have minimal impact on a user's device and battery. Background limits represent a significant change in Android, so we want every developer to get familiar with them,” the blog post reads. Related: Google Pixel 2 - What you need to know Picture-in-Picture As revealed in last week’s leak, Google is bringing new picture-in-picture features that enable users to continue watching videos while working within other apps. Apps will be able to put themselves in PiP mode, Google says. In Android O you'll be watching YouTube clips while sending boring work emails. Ace. Notification Channels Here’s a nice idea. Google is grouping notifications into channels which give users more control over app notification categories. “Users can block or change the behavior of each channel individually, rather than managing all of the app's notifications together,” Google explains. It'll also be possible to snooze individual notifications, which, given the persistence of some Android system notifications, will be most welcome. Snoozing will be possible for 15 minutes, 30 minutes or 1 hour Autofill APIs Google is bringing your favorite password manager apps in house, in the same way you can access third-party keyboards. The company writes: “Android users already depend on a range of password managers to autofill login details and repetitive information, which makes setting up new apps or placing transactions easier. Now we are making this work more easily across the ecosystem by adding platform support for autofill.” Adaptive Icons Google is adding a feature that will enable developers to use different shaped app icons depending on the manufacturer’s preference (see the .gif below). It's not clear yet whether, as speculated last week, apps icons will adapt to show users new information, such as the correct day on the calendar. UPDATE: In diving into the first preview, Android Police spotted that app icons now support badge notifications in Android O. Better keyboard navigation Google says the arrival of the Play Store on the Google Chrome OS means more users are navigating apps using a physical keyboard, so, in Android O the company is making improvements to cater for the Chromebook crowd. “In Android O we focused on building a more reliable, predictable model for "arrow" and "tab" navigation that aids both developers and end users," Google said. Wide colour gamut in imaging apps The makers of imaging apps can now make better use of the delicious new displays built by manufacturers; particularly those handsets with displays supporting a wide-gamut color "To display wide gamut images, apps will need to enable a flag in their manifest (per activity) and load bitmaps with an embedded wide color profile (AdobeRGB, Pro Photo RGB, DCI-P3, etc.)," Google advises developers. Better audio In Android NO Google is adding the Sony's LDAC codec, which has been kindly donated by the Japanese giant. This should improve upon the Bluetooth A2DP protocol used today. The company is also introducing the AAudio which could result in improved low latency audio. The firm says: It's a "new native API that's designed specifically for apps that require high-performance, low-latency audio." The first developer preview will be available to registered users on Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel, Pixel XL and Pixel C devices. “The usual caveats apply: it's early days, there are more features coming, and there's still plenty of stabilization and performance work ahead of us. But it's booting,” Google added. Is Android O's fledgling feature list floating your boat? Or will you be reserving judgement until Google I/O? Share your thoughts below.

Outside in bright sunlight recently to 'up' the brightness when looking at the black brick my phone had become, I had to find the tiny settings wheel to check "display" in order to access brightness, only achieved by going in to a shop so I could see the screen to do any of that. Luckily not the beach or park. I really wonder if Google or devs research users very much. Before anyone points out that there is an auto function, thank you, I am aware.

Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP hide caption toggle caption Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Google says it will improve its internal systems and give advertisers more control of where their spots appear, responding to complaints about the pairing of paid ads with offensive content. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Google will give advertisers more control over where their ads appear and improve its internal controls, as the owner of AdWords and YouTube apologized for "a number of cases where brands' ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values." The move comes days after reports of ads "showing up in YouTube alongside videos of white nationalists and terrorists" prompted both advertising companies and branches of the U.K. government to halt ad campaigns handled by Google, as Adweek reported. "We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us," Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said in a blog post Tuesday that promised the company would take "a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content" as of Tuesday. On Friday, the U.K. arm of the Havas agency, whose clients include the BBC and Royal Mail, said it would halt spending on YouTube and Web display ads in Google's digital advertising network. In doing so, Havas UK CEO Paul Frampton cited a duty to protect clients and "ensure their brands are not at all compromised" by appearing alongside or seeming to sponsor inappropriate content. The decision by a global marketing group with a U.K. digital budget of more than $200 million to put its dealings with Google on "pause" followed a recent controversy over YouTube star Felix "PewDiePie" Kjellberg, who lost a lucrative production contract with Maker Studios and its owner, Walt Disney Co., over "a series of anti-Semitic jokes and Nazi-related images in his videos," as the Two-way reported. As the BBC reports, "Several high profile companies, including Marks and Spencer, Audi, RBS and L'Oreal, have pulled online advertising from YouTube." Concerns over inappropriate content have risen despite Google's coming off a year in 2016 when it "removed over 100,000 publishers from our AdSense program, and prevented ads from serving on over 300 million YouTube videos," as Google U.K. Managing Director Ronan Harris said last week. He said the company has relied on technology to help it manage a system that sees 400 hours of video uploaded every minute. On Tuesday, Google promised a number of changes, from tightening its ad policies and giving advertisers the ability to "fine-tune where they want their ads to appear" to making it easier for advertisers to escalate a problem. Pledging to speed up its review process, Schindler wrote, "We'll be hiring significant numbers of people and developing new tools powered by our latest advancements in AI and machine learning to increase our capacity to review questionable content for advertising." online advertising Google Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

This first wave of software for the upcoming operating system will be available for those who design applications for Android. Google notes this is not a beta version of Android O. However, future previews may be available to a larger audience. Google is expected to roll out the second developer preview in May. This may coincide with Google I/O, which takes place May 17-19. The Android team will give more details about Android O at that time, but likely won’t reveal the full name of the operating system. Currently, pundits are banking on the name Android Oreo. There will also be June and August previews available for the official Android software releases during the third quarter. There will likely be a separate beta program for a wider range of consumers to test out the operating system before its general release. Within the Android O preview, developers will be able to test out some of Google’s new software ideas, such as setting limits on background functions, channels to organize notifications, autofill APIs, and adaptive icons, among others.   The software will only be available for manual install. Developers can access the Android O system images here and manually flash the software onto a compatible handset.   The Android O preview will be available for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and Nexus Player devices. Once official, it will likely be the native software for yet-to-be-released Pixel smartphones.

Google on Tuesday announced some changes to ensure that brands' advertisements don't appear next to horrible, offensive content. The move comes after the British government pulled millions of dollars worth of advertising from YouTube after an investigation by The Times of London found that the government's ads were showing up alongside videos from "rape apologists, anti-Semites, and banned hate preachers." In response, Google last week pledged to more closely monitor advertisements that appear alongside YouTube videos, and give brands more control over where their ads appear. Now, the web giant is taking the first steps to make good on that pledge. "Starting today, we're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content," Google's Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler wrote in a blog post. "This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories." Related Fighting ISIS, One YouTube Ad at a Time Fighting ISIS, One YouTube Ad at a Time Google will also ensure that ads only show up alongside videos from legitimate creators in the YouTube Partner Program. Plus, "the YouTube team is taking a hard look at our existing community guidelines to determine what content is allowed on the platform—not just what content can be monetized," Schindler wrote. In the coming days and months, Google plans to introduce new tools to help advertisers more easily manage where their ads appear across YouTube and the web. Advertisers will be able to exclude specific sites and channels from their campaigns, fine-tune where their ads appear, and more easily see where their ads are running. Google is also changing the default setting for ads so that they don't show on "objectionable content." "We'll be hiring significant numbers of people and developing new tools powered by our latest advancements in AI and machine learning to increase our capacity to review questionable content for advertising," Schindler wrote. With these changes, Google should be able to resolve any issues that arise "in less than a few hours."

Not only did the company apologize, but it’s developing better systems for advertisers and consumers alike, the company announced Tuesday. “Starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. This includes removing ads move effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories,” Google said in a statement Tuesday. Read: Google Apologizes For Putting Ads On Offensive Content The company plans to introduce new tools for its advertisers to use to help them better control when and where their ads show up. The default level of brands will also be raised so that advertisers are less likely to find their ads somewhere they don’t want, as well as controls that allow advertisers to pick and choose sites and channels they don’t want exposure on. These tools will be available in “the coming days and months.” Google is also planning on increasing transparency with advertisers about where their ads are running and make it easier to fix problems with poor placement faster and more efficiently, they say. “Brand safety is an ongoing commitment for us, and we’ll continue to listen to your feedback,” wrapped up the statement.

Google Fiber isn't going well. Image: justin sullivan/Getty Images Sarah McBride for Bloomberg 2017-03-21 18:56:06 UTC Follow @@business Google Fiber, the gigabit-speed internet service rolled out by Alphabet Inc., is canceling some installations in Kansas City, the latest setback for the high-profile initiative. The search giant is sending out refunds to residents that won’t be getting the service they signed up for. The metropolitan area, which straddles the border of Kansas and Missouri, was the first market for the superfast service when it debuted in 2012 and remains Fiber’s largest. “Although we’ve been working hard to bring you service, we’re unable to build our network to connect your home or business at this time,” Google Fiber said in an email to affected consumers. “Unfortunately, that means we’ll need to cancel your Fiber account.” SEE ALSO: Do you really need a college degree for that entry-level job? Google Fiber once was one of Alphabet’s most trumpeted projects, as it signaled ambitions to go head-to-head with cable and phone companies to offer internet access and bolster its main search business. Since its launch, the company overall has put a new emphasis on financial discipline under Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat. For Fiber, that has meant scaled back expansion, staffers cut and hundreds of workers shifted to Alphabet’s core web business. Alphabet’s tamping down of its Fiber goals comes at a time when some in Kansas City are disappointed with the lackluster effect the high-speed service has had on areas such as the local economy, the amount of venture-capital funding or the creation of breakout startups. SEE ALSO: Apple's app store gets a makeover Other Bets, the part of Alphabet that Google Fiber belongs to, had an operating loss of $3.58 billion last year on revenue of $809 million. Alphabet overall remains highly profitable. The company said it will provide refunds on customer deposits, typically $10, within the next two weeks. Those who already have the fiber service can keep it. Several hundred people, many of whom paid deposits years ago, are affected, said a person familiar with the situation. In markets Google Fiber entered after Kansas City, it was more careful about accepting deposits only for buildings it believed it could connect in coming quarters, the person said, asking not to be identified as the details are private. Fiber is currently in nine locations around the U.S. SEE ALSO: Meet the 13 million nerds that Apple's counting on It is unclear if the affected group includes low-income customers, who Google had pledged to connect for free.

Kansas City was the first location that Google Fiber launched in, starting back in 2012. It currently serves several areas of the city on both sides of the state line, and its coverage area is supposed to expand in the near future. But at some point over the past five years, it seems that Google began accepting signups and taking deposits from customers in areas that it has since decided not to build out to. Wireless appears to be the future for Google’s internet efforts Bloomberg reports that Google Fiber has since become “more careful” about where it takes deposits, only doing so in areas the company believes it’ll be able to reach in a shorter time frame. It’s not clear exactly what happened in the canceled Kansas City locations, but Google reportedly told customers in an email that it’ll be “unable to build our network to connect your home or business at this time.” In a statement provided to The Verge, a Google Fiber spokesperson said that the company remained committed to Kansas City. “We recently announced our expansion into Raymore, we are continuing to build in Overland Park, and we can’t wait for even more customers in Kansas City to experience what’s possible with Google Fiber,” the spokesperson said. Google Fiber deposits are usually $10, and Bloomberg says that Google will be returning the fees to customers it’s unable to serve within the next two weeks. While the cancellations are only a minor setback for Google Fiber, the company really doesn’t need more in what’s been a spate of bad news over the past year. Since becoming part of Alphabet, Google Fiber has been the subject of serious cost-cutting, with executives seemingly unhappy with the slow and expensive deployment that comes with setting up fiber internet. Alphabet now seems to be turning to wireless as the main way forward, using technology from another company it owns, Webpass, to provide gigabit internet over the air instead of waiting through slow fiber build-outs.

Name: Subject: Message: Don’t expect the next preview of Android O until mid-May Newsby John Callaham2 days ago 2 477 5 With today’s surprise release of the first Android O developer preview, Google has also posted up a schedule of when it will release its other pre-release versions of the mobile OS. As it turns out, we won’t likely get the second developer preview of Android O until sometime in mid-May. Before we go any further, we want to remind you that these developer previews that are coming over the next few months are intended, as the name indicates, for app developers. In other words, if you are not currently making Android apps for a living, you might want to stay away from these builds. With that being said, today’s preview release, which Google labels as an “alpha” build, and the next release in May, which has the “beta” label, is mainly for Google to get feedback from those developers on this early version of Android O. Developers can also use these two early build to make sure their apps are compatible with Android O. Android O is now official, Developer Preview images live now Download Android O Developer Preview 1 here The third developer preview, which Google currently shows is due sometime in mid-June, is when Google will release the final versions of the Android O APIs, along with its official SDK tools for developers. Developers with older apps can also make their final final compatibility tests with Android O Developer Preview 3. The fourth and final developer preview for Android O is not supposed to happen until sometime after July. It will have the near-final images, and developers can go ahead and publish their Android O-compatible apps to the Google Play Store as alphas and betas, so that consumers can check them out ahead of the final version of the OS. The current schedule shows that Android O will officially launch sometime in the third quarter of 2017, or between July and September. However, keep in mind that schedules can change between now and those target dates, so it’s possible Google could push back the final build of the OS beyond what their current timeline shows.

Photographer: Patrick Tehan/Bay Area News Group/MCT Google moved Tuesday to protect its lucrative advertising business by giving marketers greater control over where their ads appear online, after major clients withdrew spots that were shown next to hate speech and other offensive material. Google has become a global advertising behemoth, pocketing billions of dollars every year from brands promoting their goods through the company’s search engine and on YouTube. But the changes, which will be introduced in the coming weeks, highlight the difficult balance between protecting Google’s advertising business while also allowing free speech. By giving brands greater say over where their ads appears, experts say, Google is acknowledging that it has not done enough so far to police the material on its sites. “Recently, we had a number of cases where brands’ ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologize,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said in a blog post Tuesday. “We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us.” Google’s efforts to clean up its act show how dependent it remains on online advertising, despite the large bets its parent company, Alphabet, has made on other technologies, like driverless cars and health care. Last year, Alphabet made $19.5 billion in net profit, a 23 percent annual jump, almost all of which was generated from Google’s advertising business. Google’s public mea culpa follows the pulling of ads by Havas, a French advertising multinational. Havas withdrew spots for several of its clients from the search giant’s digital services in Britain after failing to receive assurances that they would not be shown next to offensive material. As part of the advertising revamp, Google said that it would rigorously vet online content that could be considered hate speech or derogatory content. That would include giving brands greater say over where their ads would be shown online and powers to remove them if companies were still not satisfied. The company said that it would hire more staff members to police its advertising standards, adding that it would also use artificial intelligence and other technology to remove harmful content. “We believe the combination of these new policies and controls will significantly strengthen our ability to help advertisers,” Schindler said. Google refrained, however, from saying that it would actively remove material before it had been flagged by users, a move that some policymakers, notably in Europe, have called for. In a recent study in Germany, the company was found to have removed 90 percent of posts flagged as potential hate speech after it had been reported. That figure was markedly higher than those of Facebook and Twitter. Google’s stance has come under increased scrutiny in recent months with the rise of so-called fake news and with hate speech connected to elections in the United States and Europe, among others. Some freedom of speech campaigners have urged Google to stand its ground, but policymakers around the world have called on the company to do more to combat the spread of offensive material on the internet.

Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP hide caption toggle caption Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Google says it will improve its internal systems and give advertisers more control of where their spots appear, responding to complaints about the pairing of paid ads with offensive content. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Google will give advertisers more control over where their ads appear and improve its internal controls, as the owner of AdWords and YouTube apologized for "a number of cases where brands' ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values." The move comes days after reports of ads "showing up in YouTube alongside videos of white nationalists and terrorists" prompted both advertising companies and branches of the U.K. government to halt ad campaigns handled by Google, as Adweek reported. "We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us," Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said in a blog post Tuesday that promised the company would take "a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content" as of Tuesday. On Friday, the U.K. arm of the Havas agency, whose clients include the BBC and Royal Mail, said it would halt spending on YouTube and Web display ads in Google's digital advertising network. In doing so, Havas UK CEO Paul Frampton cited a duty to protect clients and "ensure their brands are not at all compromised" by appearing alongside or seeming to sponsor inappropriate content. The decision by a global marketing group with a U.K. digital budget of more than $200 million to put its dealings with Google on "pause" followed a recent controversy over YouTube star Felix "PewDiePie" Kjellberg, who lost a lucrative production contract with Maker Studios and its owner, Walt Disney Co., over "a series of anti-Semitic jokes and Nazi-related images in his videos," as the Two-way reported. As the BBC reports, "Several high profile companies, including Marks and Spencer, Audi, RBS and L'Oreal, have pulled online advertising from YouTube." Concerns over inappropriate content have risen despite Google's coming off a year in 2016 when it "removed over 100,000 publishers from our AdSense program, and prevented ads from serving on over 300 million YouTube videos," as Google U.K. Managing Director Ronan Harris said last week. He said the company has relied on technology to help it manage a system that sees 400 hours of video uploaded every minute. On Tuesday, Google promised a number of changes, from tightening its ad policies and giving advertisers the ability to "fine-tune where they want their ads to appear" to making it easier for advertisers to escalate a problem. Pledging to speed up its review process, Schindler wrote, "We'll be hiring significant numbers of people and developing new tools powered by our latest advancements in AI and machine learning to increase our capacity to review questionable content for advertising." online advertising Google Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

Users that wish to partake in this download will want to pay attention to the warnings from Google made this afternoon. This release is different from those in the past in that it’s specifically NOT part of the Android Beta program – instead, it’s meant for developers extra-specifically. While we’ve seen the line between developer preview and Android Beta downloads blurred in the past, with Android O, Google is clear. This is a system that only developers should really be wanting to use. With Android O, Google is not prepared to have half the early early adopter Android fan universe downloading all at once. Users prepared to take the step to handling a Developer Preview version of Android O can do so through Google’s Developer Portal. At the Download Android O page, users will find several versions of this software available. This software is available for four phones, one tablet, and one Android TV device. • Nexus 5X • Nexus 6P • Pixel • Pixel XL • Nexus Player • Pixel C This update requires that the user flash a new system image to their smartphone, tablet, or Nexus Player. As such, all data will be removed from the device being updated. It’s important to save all important data from the device before doing any sort of high-level flashing such as this. There’s also a set of instructions for Uninstalling the Preview from a device at the same link as shown above. Scroll to the bottom of the page and read how it’s going to go down. • Date: March 2017 • Build: OPP1.170223.012 (Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel, Pixel XL), OPP1.170223.013 (Pixel C) • Emulator support: x86 & ARM (32/64-bit) • Google Play services: 10 • API diff: DP1/25 Google’s set of Instructions for this newest update is pretty much the same as it has been for the past several. Head to Flashing Instructions on the page Factory Images for Nexus and Pixel Devices to see how it’s done. You’ll need a desktop machine – Windows or Mac OS will do just fine. Stick around for additional updates on Android O well through the future. See SlashGear’s giant Android Hub for all the updates your heart can handle!

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Google unveils the next version of Android Listen | Print By James Walker     Mar 21, 2017 in Technology Google has officially announced Android O, the next major version of its mobile operating system set to be released later this year. The company has launched the first preview of the under-development OS, introducing several major new features. The as-yet unnamed Android O follows last year's Nougat and in many ways is a continuation of Google's work during 2016. The company is continuing to focus on Android's productivity, security and performance features, giving phones and tablets the capability to handle more tasks while running for longer. Notification channels There are currently four headline features in Android O, alongside several other smaller ones. First up is notification channels, a system apps can use to define categories for their notifications. An app from a news publisher could create categories such as "World," "Business" and "Technology." Notifications it distributes would then be assigned one of these categories. Notification channels in Android O Google You can then use the categories to fine-tune the notifications you want to receive from an app. Currently, you can only turn an app's notifications on or off. Under Android O, you'll be able to disable notifications in the "World" and "Business" categories but keep tech news alerts turned on. It's an official solution to the checkbox options already offered by some developers, letting you precisely control the notification activity of any supporting app from Android's settings menu. Picture-in-picture Google is extending Android's split-screen multitasking capabilities introduced last year with a new picture-in-picture display mode. Supporting apps will allow their main content to be popped out into a sticky window that persists on the display above other apps. It'll be most useful for media players and video conferencing solutions. Android O icon Google Apple already offers a picture-in-picture mode on the iPad and Microsoft will enable it for Windows 10 tablets in the next few weeks. Android the currently the only platform to support it on phones though, letting you multitask more effectively while on the go. Autofill Google is adding a new autofill API which will allow apps to act as autofill agents. This is an interesting extension of Android's platform capabilities which could give rise to a new class of apps. In the same way as you currently install a custom keyboard, with Android O you'll be able to download autofill providers. These apps will be able to store data like your email address and phone number and automatically add it to form fields in other apps. This could enable existing password management solutions like LastPass to integrate directly with the operating system. Adaptive Icons Adaptive icons in Android O Google The last major visual feature announced so far is a change aimed mainly at developers but also significant for users. In recognition of the fragmented state of Android skins and launchers used by phone manufacturers, Google is launching a new system that will enable app icons to automatically adjust to suit a device's theme. In a world where people obsess over making sure their app icons match and line up, Android O will make it a little easier to obtain a neat home screen. Adaptive icons will be able to transition between different shapes, such as square, circular and rounded corners, depending on the standard used by the phone. The adaptive icons system also enables animations for the icons in several settings. The best of the rest Android O is still many months away from being publicly launched and it's expected Google will add more features before the summer. Additional minor capabilities announced today include support for wide-gamut colour apps, keyboard navigation within apps, support for new Wi-Fi features and improved system audio throughput. Android O Google Finally, Google is taking its work on improving Android's battery life up another level, announcing new limits on what apps can do while in the background. The company said this will help further lower the system's power consumption. If you want to live on the cutting edge, you can download the first developer preview of Android O today if you own a supported device. As ever with very early versions of pre-release software, this shouldn't be installed on a device you rely on as it almost certainly contains critical bugs. Google warned the build is not intended for consumer use. It won't be offered over the usual Android Beta channel owing to its instability.

The company indicated that while its changes would take some time to be fully implemented, it said it would seek to resolve any complaints within a matter of hours. The shake-up follows a storm of protest from major UK companies and others - including the Government - which pulled their advertising from Google's YouTube site after it was shown alongside hate-filled content uploaded by users. Google, which has apologised for the situation, said its new policies would give advertisers more control over where their ads are shown - admitting it had struggled to police the average 400 hours of video uploaded to the platform each minute. :: Google's ID crisis at heart of ad row It said it was aiming to block any content that attacked people based on their race, religion, sexual orientation or gender. Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, said in a blog post: "We'll be hiring significant numbers of people and developing new tools powered by our latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to increase our capacity to review questionable content for advertising." He added: "We're changing the default settings for ads so that they show on content that meets a higher level of brand safety and excludes potentially objectionable content that advertisers may prefer not to advertise against. "In addition, we'll introduce new controls to make it easier for brands to exclude higher risk content and fine-tune where they want their ads to appear." Google has been under fire on several fronts in recent days over its apparent inability to deal with the problem until the point when advertisers started a boycott. The US firm generates over £6bn in revenue from the UK market annually - the majority of that coming from advertising. The boss of FTSE 100 advertising firm WPP, Sir Martin Sorrell, raised the prospect of compensation for advertisers in an interview with Sky News on Monday. The chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee of MPs, Yvette Cooper, said the firm could afford to do "far more, far faster" to battle hate content. The committee has made it clear that it does not see the issue being one only for Google. Last week, it summoned bosses from Google, Facebook and Twitter, to question them about the action the web giants are taking to remove extreme content from their platforms.

Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP hide caption toggle caption Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Google says it will improve its internal systems and give advertisers more control of where their spots appear, responding to complaints about the pairing of paid ads with offensive content. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Google will give advertisers more control over where their ads appear and improve its internal controls, as the owner of AdWords and YouTube apologized for "a number of cases where brands' ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values." The move comes days after reports of ads "showing up in YouTube alongside videos of white nationalists and terrorists" prompted both advertising companies and branches of the U.K. government to halt ad campaigns handled by Google, as Adweek reported. "We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us," Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said in a blog post Tuesday that promised the company would take "a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content" as of Tuesday. On Friday, the U.K. arm of the Havas agency, whose clients include the BBC and Royal Mail, said it would halt spending on YouTube and Web display ads in Google's digital advertising network. In doing so, Havas UK CEO Paul Frampton cited a duty to protect clients and "ensure their brands are not at all compromised" by appearing alongside or seeming to sponsor inappropriate content. The decision by a global marketing group with a U.K. digital budget of more than $200 million to put its dealings with Google on "pause" followed a recent controversy over YouTube star Felix "PewDiePie" Kjellberg, who lost a lucrative production contract with Maker Studios and its owner, Walt Disney Co., over "a series of anti-Semitic jokes and Nazi-related images in his videos," as the Two-way reported. As the BBC reports, "Several high profile companies, including Marks and Spencer, Audi, RBS and L'Oreal, have pulled online advertising from YouTube." Concerns over inappropriate content have risen despite Google's coming off a year in 2016 when it "removed over 100,000 publishers from our AdSense program, and prevented ads from serving on over 300 million YouTube videos," as Google U.K. Managing Director Ronan Harris said last week. He said the company has relied on technology to help it manage a system that sees 400 hours of video uploaded every minute. On Tuesday, Google promised a number of changes, from tightening its ad policies and giving advertisers the ability to "fine-tune where they want their ads to appear" to making it easier for advertisers to escalate a problem. Pledging to speed up its review process, Schindler wrote, "We'll be hiring significant numbers of people and developing new tools powered by our latest advancements in AI and machine learning to increase our capacity to review questionable content for advertising." online advertising Google Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

Coinciding with today's announcement, it's also released its first Developer Preview, offering those who create software for the platform an early glimpse of what to expect in the coming months. Google said that "the O Developer Preview includes an updated SDK with system images for testing on the official Android Emulator". The company has also launched a new Developer Preview site with resources on the new edition, along with information on behavior changes and new APIs in the OS. This first Developer Preview will be supported on six devices: Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel C Pixel Pixel XL Google emphasizes - in more than one place - that "Developer Preview 1 is for developers only and not intended for daily or consumer use." Those who plan to install it are urged to read the release notes before doing so. A consumer beta will be released "as we get closer to a final product".

Name: Subject: Message: Google adds shortcuts to its main search app for quicker answers Newsby John Callaham2 days ago 3 302 13 Even in this world where digital assistants can help out, sometimes you just want to search the internet yourself for general information like news, weather, the latest sports scores and more. Today, Google is rolling out an update to its main search app for iOS and Android in the US that will add shortcuts below the search bar. They will include a number of general topics that can be tapped to bring up internet search results, instead of typing in a search string. See also: Best free Android apps of 2017 3 weeks ago Google says that typing in the normal search bar is terrific if you have a specific thing you want to look up, such as “10 best dating apps for Android“. However, the new shortcuts feature is designed to offer one-tap results for more common questions like what’s currently playing at your local movie theater, or a quick lookup of the nearest places to eat. Sports fans can tap on a shortcut to get the latest scores and news, and they can also be customized so you can quickly find out the news on your favorite teams. It’s not just search results that are included in these shortcuts. Google also offers quick one-tap access in the search app to its translation service, along with a currency converter, a calculator, an internet speed test and much more. Shortcuts are also available for your Gmail and schedule of events. The app even includes quick access to simple games and, yes, you can even tap on an “I’m feeling curious” shortcut to bring up a random search result. The shortcuts are being rolled out to the Google search apps in the US at the moment; there’s no word on when they will be added in other markets. This is certainly a feature that should have been added to the app for a while, and we are curious to see if it become popular. Even though, as we mentioned, digital assistants can handle much of these kinds of answers with voice commands, sometime there are situations where you just don’t want to speak to get info on whether or not the Cubs won their game last night.

Dave Burke, VP of Engineering at Google took to the Android Developers Blog on Tuesday to announce that the next version of their operating system will be called Android O and developers can now start downloading (manual and/or flash) its first Preview for testing and building apps around it. The first Android O Developer Preview, which is 'strictly' not intended for daily or consumer use, is available for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel, Pixel XL and Pixel C devices. "If you're building for wearables, there's also an emulator for testing Android Wear 2.0 on Android O," Burke said. "I'm excited to share a first developer preview of the next version of the OS: Android O. The usual caveats apply: it's early days, there are more features coming, and there's still plenty of stabilization and performance work ahead of us. But it's booting," Burke added. Since last year, Google has been gung-ho about developer feedback, which is why it launched N Preview early. Android O has been given a similar treatment. The reason, as usual, is that Google wants to gather as much feedback as possible from devs before going full commando with O later this year. Of course, we can expect the Mountain View company to out a big reveal at I/O in May. Only difference is unlike say a couple of years ago, many of us would already know what to expect from Google's OS in the days to come now more than ever. At this point of time, it seems O is largely focused on building up on N which isn't surprising. But, at the same time, because N wasn't a drastic overhaul of M, O is expected to bring in huge changes. For now, the first Android O Developer Preview brings along background limits to further improve battery life, granular notification control,  adaptive icons and more. "Building on the work we began in Nougat, Android O puts a big priority on improving a user's battery life and the device's interactive performance. To make this possible, we've put additional automatic limits on what apps can do in the background, in three main areas: implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates. These changes will make it easier to create apps that have minimal impact on a user's device and battery," Burke further said. "Channels let developers give users fine-grained control over different kinds of notifications - users can block or change the behavior of each channel individually, rather than managing all of the app's notifications together." Adaptive icons, meanwhile, are customisable icons that also have an animated angle to them. The first Android O Developer Preview also brings autofill APIs, a wide colour gamut for apps, keyboard navigation and more. It must be remembered that this is just one of the many Previews of Android O and Google "plans to update the preview system images and SDK regularly throughout the O Developer Preview" before rolling out Android O one and for all. There's a lot to look forward to including the next batch of Pixels.

The update doesn’t sound earth shattering at this (very) early stage, but among the surprising tidbits is just how much work Android partners are putting in to help improve the overall OS. The standout, according to Google, is Sony Mobile. Sony has so far “contributed more than 30 feature enhancements and 250 bug fixes,” a Google spokesperson said. Chief among Sony’s priorities seems to be helping Android become a better platform for wirelessly enjoying high-res audio. Or at least something close to it, and substantially better than what Bluetooth does right now. Sony has contributed its LDAC wireless audio coding technology to Android O. LDAC can transfer much more data over Bluetooth — up to a bitrate of 990kbps — than what’s typically possible from smartphones. Here’s one explainer from Sony, and here’s another. Unlike other Bluetooth compatible coding technologies such as SBC, it operates without any down-conversion of the Hi-Res Audio content, and allows approximately three times more data than those other technologies to be transmitted over a Bluetooth wireless network with unprecedented sound quality, by means of efficient coding and optimized packetization. LDAC is already built into Sony’s expensive Walkman players, its high-end wireless headphones (like the excellent noise-cancelling MDR-1000x), Sony-branded wireless speakers, and Xperia smartphones. But now other Android phone makers will be able to wirelessly transit higher quality audio using LDAC to speakers and headphones that have the technology included. This stands to mostly benefit Sony’s own products right now, since no one else is using LDAC and would likely have to pay a licensing fee to put it in a speaker or wireless headphones. It’s free to integrate into mobile devices, as Google confirmed LDAC is now part of the Android AOSP base code. Will LDAC matter to most consumers listening to music on a $99 Bluetooth speaker? Nope. But as music services continue to push into lossless and high-resolution streaming (Spotify’s experimenting with it right now), this sort of thing will help audiophiles enjoy much improved audio without having to plug into the headphone jack — if their phone even has one. That’ll still be necessary for true 24-bit/96kHz listening, but this is a decent step up until Bluetooth 5 makes it out the door.

 Google Maps has a new feature to ensure you never forget where you parked your car Nick Vega Mar. 21, 2017, 2:18 PM 15,887 facebook linkedin twitter email print Business Insider Google has introduced a new feature to make sure Android users never forget where they park their cars.  The update, first spotted by Android Police, comes in the form of a new menu option when you open Google Maps and tap on the blue icon that indicates your location. You will now be given the option to "save your parking" which will then place a blue "P" on the spot.  The same option will also give you the opportunity to add notes to your parking icon, as well as include photos if you really want to make sure everything goes smoothly. This feature should be especially handy to travellers that leave their cars parked at airports for long stretches, or for drivers that leave their cars in multi-tiered parking lots.  In addition, the updated parking feature allows you to set a timer on your parking spot, in case the spot is at a meter or has a time limit. This is a thoughtful and welcome feature, and should prove to be extremely useful.  Google Maps users on iOS will likely have to wait a bit longer for the update to make its way onto the App Store, but it is surely on its way.

Comments On 21 March 2017 Google made available the Android O Developer Preview, and for the second time it did so ahead of its annual Google I/O Developer's Conference. The final version won't be with us until late summer, but if you're curious it is possible to download Android O today on compatible devices. Also see: Android O latest news and rumours Should I install Android O? Unless you are a developer, then the answer is quite simply no. Google doesn't intend this first build of Android O to be available to the general public, and for that reason it has not issued the beta through the usual Android Beta over-the-air channel. Some of you will insist on doing so anyway. So you should know that this will be entirely on you, and if you don't know what you're doing you could very easily brick your device. And with that in mind you should take the necessary steps to ensure all your data is backed up. Will my phone or tablet run Android O? The Android O Developer Preview can run on only certain Google devices. Those devices are: Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Google Pixel C Google Nexus 6P Google Nexus 5X Nexus Player How can I download and install Android O? In order to download Android O you will need to manually flash the software to your device, but be warned that this will remove all data from the device.  You can download the file for your supported device from the Google Developer's site here. Click here for advice on how to flash that file to your device. How do I uninstall Android O? To uninstall Android O following your trials you will need to download and flash to your device a factory image of Android Nougat. On the next page you'll find our advice on how to use the Android Beta channel to install Android OS previews, including the current Android Nougat 7.1.2 beta. Right now this method will not work for Android O, though we will update our instructions accordingly once Google releases Android O into the Android Beta channel. >> Read on… Pages 1 2 3 Tags: Smartphones, Software, Tablets, Android Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Amid Growing Boycott in, Google To Overhaul Ad Policies By Alex Hern PUBLISHED: MARCH 21 2017 Google has promised a wide-ranging overhaul of its advertising policies in response to a growing boycott of the company's platforms from leading brands and advertisers including the UK government, Marks & Spencer and McDonald's. In a blogpost published on Monday night, Philipp Schindler, the company's chief business officer, wrote: "We have strict policies that define where Google ads should appear, and in the vast majority of cases, our policies and tools work as intended. But at times we don't get it right. "Recently, we had a number of cases where brands' ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologize." p> Many of the companies involved in the boycott had discovered that their advertising spend was being used to place banner adverts over YouTube videos from groups such as Britain First, indirectly funding extremists and damaging the prestige of their brands. In response, Schindler has promised a three-tier overhaul of Google's advertising policies, both on YouTube and on the company's wider ad products. First, Google itself is going to tighten its policies around what can live on its platforms, and what subset of that content can support advertising on it. "Starting today, we're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content," Schindler says. The company is also ensuring that fake creators -- those who impersonate other channels -- can't host advertising. Schindler also says YouTube is "taking a hard look" at existing community guidelines to see if any content is allowed on the platform that shouldn't be, though no action is promised. Second, the company is promising better controls for advertisers to choose where their money goes, and to prevent accidentally spending it on hateful content. The default options for advertisers will be tightened, to exclude "potentially objectionable" content from the off. Advertisers themselves will be given account-level tools to exclude specific sites and channels from all of their campaigns at once, as well as more fine-tuned controls for when advertisers need specific say over where their ads appear. Third, Schindler writes that advertisers and agencies will be offered "more transparency and visibility on where their ads are running". That should help advertisers avoid awkward situations like those that prompted the boycott in the first place, where advertisers only discovered their ads were showing up on extremist content after a Times report. The Google executive also promises to hire "significant numbers of people," as well as bring in new AI-powered tools, to increase the company's capacity to review questionable content for advertising. Google's new offering comes after a rare apology from the company. Its UK head, Matt Brittin, told the Advertising Week Europe conference in London that "When anything like that happens, we don't want it to happen, you don't want it to happen, and we take responsibility for it … So I want to start by saying sorry. We apologize." It is not yet clear whether the new measures go far enough to reassure advertisers. The BBC, L'Oréal, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Audi, Channel 4 and the Guardian are among the firms to suspend advertising. The company's role in funding extreme content has come under scrutiny, in part prompted by the victory of Donald Trump in 2016's US election. That led to a focus on so-called "Fake News," many of the purveyors of which rely on Google's advertising products for monetizing their hoax content. A grassroots campaign, Sleeping Giants, has also begun directly pressurizing advertisers in the US and Europe to pull their spend from "racist websites," with a particular focus on the far-right outlet Breitbart. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Walmart Is Acquiring ModCloth Next Article > LinkedIn Jumps into CRM with New Sales Navigator Edition By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: MARCH 21 2017 Business social network LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, took a major step into the customer relationship management (CRM) sector today with the announcement that it would be adding a new enterprise edition to its Sales Navigator service. The new version of the software adds several features designed to help salespeople use LinkedIn as a social selling platform to generate sales leads. That includes the ability to send up to 50 messages through the platform’s InMail system, improved manageability features, such as Single Sign-On, and something the company is calling TeamLink Extend, which aims to make it easier for LinkedIn members to search for contacts within their organizations that could introduce them to prospects at potential client companies. Social Selling "Until now, if you were looking for a warm introduction to a lead, you could go through your personal LinkedIn connections, or use TeamLink, which pools the networks of all the Sales Navigator seat holders in your company," Doug Camplejohn, LinkedIn sales solutions head of product, wrote in a blog post. "But we know your reps are probably not connected on LinkedIn to the vast majority of employees at your company, and not every employee in your company needs a seat of Sales Navigator (as much as we’d like that)." Camplejohn said TeamLink Extend solves that problem by allowing anyone in an organization to connect their own network of contacts to their company’s TeamLink pool. "That means, if you’re trying to reach a prospect, you can quickly see if anyone in your company has a connection with that person, and reach out to your colleague to ask for a warm introduction," Camplejohn said. The Enterprise Edition license will include 1000 seats for TeamLink Extend, the company added. LinkedIn is also integrating its PointDrive service into the new edition. The company acquired PointDrive, which allows salespeople to share sales content such as presentation and other documents with prospective clients, last year. PointDrive will now come bundled with both the Enterprise and Team editions of Sales Navigator, the company said. Integrating CRM But PointDrive is not the only thing LinkedIn is integrating into Sales Navigator. It is also increasing integration between the service and CRM systems. Sales Navigator will now include writeback functionality, allowing users to automatically sync their Sales Navigator activities with their CRM systems without having to enter the data in manually. "As you take notes, send InMails or even place calls from the Sales Navigator mobile app for iOS and Android, you can now write them as activities to your CRM with a simple mouse click," Camplejohn said. "For Sales and Operations leaders that want their reps' Sales Navigator activity recorded in the CRM, they now have an easy, authorized way to do it." CRM Sync will be available for use with the Salesforce CRM platform at launch, while LinkedIn said it will be adding additional CRM platforms in the future.

The update packs a lot of the same features that we told you about in our report last week, including background limits, new notification channels, picture-in-picture for devices beyond the Android TV, adaptive icons, wide-gamut color for apps, and more… Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services This a pretty substantial update for developers, and like Marshmallow and Nougat that preceded it, it doesn’t pack all that many features that will be noticeable for the average user. There’s no huge Material Design facelift like we saw with Lollipop, for instance. There are tons of developer-focused additions, however, and those will likely over time become very useful for just about anyone. Background limits, notifications, picture in picture Headlining Google’s list is limits on backgrounding, which the company says — as we speculated last week — is for “improving a user’s battery life and the device’s interactive performance.” This is basically a limit that Google is placing on what apps can do in the background, and the company says it covers three areas: implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates. As Google notes, this is a “significant change,” but the benefit for the end user will — hopefully — be better battery life on just about any device. The update also brings “Notification channels,” which are new categories defined by apps for managing notification content. This feature will in essence allow users more control over what notifications they receive for any app — given that the app implements them of course. For example, a sports news app could theoretically allow users — on an OS level — to receive only notifications for a certain team that you choose, rather than all notifications from the app. Google also says that Android O brings “new visuals and grouping” to notifications, which should “make is easier for users to see what’s going on when they have an incoming message.” Once we get the Developer Preview build of Android O on our devices, we’ll take a closer look at this feature. As we reported would be the case, Android O also brings the picture-in-picture display functionality from Android TV over to phones and tablets. With support from third-party apps, users will be able to do things like watch a YouTube video in a detached window while reading their email. Google says that Android O also features other windowing features, like a new app overlay window and multi-display support. As I said, we’ll be taking a closer look at these features as soon as we have Android O up and running (and apps installed that support them). …and lots more For developers, Android brings Autofill APIs, which support an “autofill app” much the same way a user can choose a “keyboard app”. This will mean that apps like 1Password or LastPass can be used system-wide, providing easy access to user data like “addresses, user names, and even passwords.” Google is also adding font support in XML, adaptive icons, support for wide-gamut color for apps, a plethora of connectivity improvements, improved keyboard navigation, new APIS for Pro Audio, WebView enhancements, Java 8 APIs and runtime optimizations, and more. And even more While these features expand and detail a lot of what we heard about Android O, Google says that this is just the beginning for Android O. We’ve heard about other features, like a smart text selection floating toolbar w/ Assistant integration, improvements to MediaRecorder API, and “tons of enterprise stuff” also on the way, and it seems likely they’re in the works. While not mentioned in today’s announcement, perhaps these things are still to come. How do I get it? Google says that this release is intended for developers only, so you can’t get it via the Android Beta program just yet — you’ll have to manually flash the update on a very limited list of compatible devices. The factory images seem to be hitting Google’s site right about now, we have a tutorial available to help you install them, and we’ll soon have an updating list of everything that Android O brings for those interested in the nitty gritty.

If you have the Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, or Pixel C, there’s a build of Android O available for you to install prior to the update’s official unveiling later this year. Be aware however, that this is a very early build of the OS and is riddled with bugs, glitches, and overall performance jankiness. If that doesn’t sway you, though, keep reading… Note: This guide assumes you already have your phone’s bootloader unlocked and the ADB tools installed on your computer. If you need the ADB tools, head over and download the Android SDK, and if you need to unlock your bootloader, keep reading. Before we get started, we need to make sure that your device is visible to your computer. Type the command “adb devices” in your Terminal app; if you see your device listed, you’re ready to go. If not, make sure your device has ADB debugging turned on in Settings. Unlock the bootloader If you know that your device is already unlocked, feel free to skip this section and keep reading. Otherwise, you need to make sure your phone’s bootloader is unlocked before you can flash a factory image. Bootloader locking is a security feature that requires that your device is completely wiped when going from a “locked” state to an “unlocked” state. For this reason, there’s no way to keep your data if your bootloader is locked (unless you’re going through the Android Beta program, which will be available for Android O sometime before Google I/O 2017). If you need to unlock your bootloader, go to the Settings app and head to “Developer options” (if you don’t see Developer options, go to the “About” page and tap the Android build number several times). Make sure that “OEM unlocking” is checked. Next, use the command “adb reboot bootloader” to go to the device’s bootloader and check if your device is in the locked state. If the bootloader on your Nexus device is locked, make sure your device is at the bootloader screen and use the “fastboot oem unlock” command. After this, you should see some prompts on your device to confirm that you do indeed want to unlock your bootloader. After you confirm this, your device is going to be completely wiped and you’ll be ready to move on with this guide. Download and prepare the factory image If you haven’t already, grab the latest build of Android O from Google’s factory image page. Once you’ve downloaded the .tgz file, extract it. Inside the extracted .tgz file there will be a .zip file titled something like “marlin-nde63h-factory-96adcecf.zip” (Pixel XL), and after you extract that file, you’ll find the boot loader, OS image, vendor image, and a radio image (depending on your device). Not recommended: modify the “flash-all” script to save your data You only need to follow these instructions if your device already had an unlocked bootloader and you want to keep your data. Otherwise the flash will format your device and all data will be lost. If your bootloader is locked, your data will have to be wiped anyway as described above. If you don’t want to lose your data in this case, you need to restart your device and back it up manually. We do not recommend doing this, since it could cause even more bugs than you would normally experience with a developer preview. If that doesn’t sway you, keep reading… The “flash-all” script contains all of the commands necessary to flash the factory image onto your device. Before running it from the command line, you might want to remove the flag that wipes your data (although this isn’t ideal, you might run into problems especially if it’s a major upgrade). In the file you extracted you’ll find two flash-all scripts as mentioned above. The flash-all script with the .bat extension works with the Windows command line while the .sh extension works with the Unix command line (macOS, Linux, etc). Open up the proper flash-all script with your favorite text editor and remove the “-w” from the file. “-w” is an ADB flag which wipes all of the user data (the stuff we want to keep). Once you’ve made the change, save your file, and open up a command line program. Run the script and install Android O As we did earlier to check unlock status, you need to boot into your bootloader to flash the factory image. Run the command “adb reboot bootloader” again to get there. Alternatively, you could start up the device while holding the volume down and power keys simultaneously to boot into the bootloader. Now point your command line to the file directory with the flash-all script. (Ex: cd /Users/<yourusername>/Downloads/hammerhead-lrx21o). For more help on using the command line, see this cheat sheet. Once you’ve pointed to the correct directory, run your script. On Unix/Mac, run “./flash-all.sh” On Windows, run “flash-all.bat” Now you should see the script running on-screen. It’ll take a little over five minutes for the image to install. Once the image is installed, the script will automatically reboot your phone. The first boot usually takes a while, so wait about 10 minutes before assuming you’ve entered a bootloop. Some users have had issues with the flash-all script not working on some devices. If that’s the case for you, you’re going to need to flash all of the images manually. It’s not a hard process, though, and only requires a few extra steps. Make sure your device is in the proper bootloader state, and then follow these instructions: First, flash the bootloader and the radio, and then reboot the bootloader (radio only applies to some devices): fastboot flash bootloader <bootloader file name here>.img fastboot flash radio <radio file name here>.img fastboot reboot-bootloader Flash the recovery, boot, system, and vendor images (vendor only applies to the Nexus 9): fastboot flash recovery recovery.img fastboot flash boot boot.img fastboot flash system system.img fastboot flash vendor vendor.img Recommended: For a full wipe, flash cache and userdata as well (userdata only applies to some devices): fastboot flash cache cache.img fastboot flash userdata userdata.img Reboot your device: fastboot reboot After the phone boots, you should have Android O developer preview and, if you opted to modify the flash-all script, all of your data should be intact.

Australia: Tech Giants Paying Taxes Next Article > Supreme Court Sympathetic to Microsoft in Xbox Owners' Suit By Jessica Gresko PUBLISHED: MARCH 22 2017 The Supreme Court suggested Tuesday that it is sympathetic to Microsoft Corp. in a dispute with disgruntled owners of the Xbox 360 video-game system who sued saying the console has a design defect that scratches game discs. The justices heard arguments Tuesday in a case that involves the Xbox 360 owners' attempts to get class action status for their lawsuit, which was filed several years ago in the state of Washington, where Microsoft is headquartered. Xbox 360 owners were initially denied class action status in the lawsuit. Several justices seemed sympathetic to Microsoft's argument that the Xbox 360 owners shouldn't be permitted to use a procedural maneuver to force an appeals court to weigh in after the appeals court declined to do so. Microsoft has sold millions of Xbox 360 consoles since they were introduced in 2005. It says only 0.4 percent of owners report disk scratching and that in many cases damage is the result of consumer misuse. The company says consumers were warned both in the instruction manual and on a sticker affixed to the console not to move it while a disc was inside. When a handful of Xbox 360 owners sued, a federal judge initially said the lawsuit couldn't proceed as a class action, and an appeals court declined to consider an appeal of that decision. The Xbox 360 owners then asked the judge to dismiss their case, a procedural move designed to get the appeals court to weigh in, which it did. Microsoft says that shouldn't be allowed to happen. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the attorney for the Xbox 360 owners, Peter Stris, that "rule makers went through a lot of work" to come up with the rule governing appeals in class action cases and suggested he was making an end run around it. And Justice Stephen Breyer suggested the "simplicity" of ruling for Microsoft seemed preferable, asking Stris if there was "anything terrible that would happen" if the justices ruled against his clients. Arguing for Microsoft, lawyer Jeffrey Fisher told the court that ruling for the Xbox 360 owners would "upend" the "carefully considered" rule governing an appeal of a class action determination. Business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have urged the court to side with Microsoft. In briefs to the court they say a ruling for the Xbox 360 owners gives those who file questionable class action lawsuits another chance to pursue class action status if they fail to get it at an early stage of the litigation. Businesses say that would make defending against class action lawsuits more expensive and push businesses to settle claims. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Alex Hern. Updated March 21, 2017 9:35AM SHARE ALSO SEE Google Online Advertising United Kingdom Europe Brand Marketing YouTube Google has promised a wide-ranging overhaul of its advertising policies in response to a growing boycott of the company's platforms from leading brands and advertisers including the UK government, Marks & Spencer and McDonald's. In a blogpost published on Monday night, Philipp Schindler, the company's chief business officer, wrote: "We have strict policies that define where Google ads should appear, and in the vast majority of cases, our policies and tools work as intended. But at times we don't get it right. "Recently, we had a number of cases where brands' ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologize." p> Many of the companies involved in the boycott had discovered that their advertising spend was being used to place banner adverts over YouTube videos from groups such as Britain First, indirectly funding extremists and damaging the prestige of their brands. In response, Schindler has promised a three-tier overhaul of Google's advertising policies, both on YouTube and on the company's wider ad products. First, Google itself is going to tighten its policies around what can live on its platforms, and what subset of that content can support advertising on it. "Starting today, we're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content," Schindler says. The company is also ensuring that fake creators -- those who impersonate other channels -- can't host advertising. Schindler also says YouTube is "taking a hard look" at existing community guidelines to see if any content is allowed on the platform that shouldn't be, though no action is promised. Second, the company is promising better controls for advertisers to choose where their money goes, and to prevent accidentally spending it on hateful content. The default options for advertisers will be tightened, to exclude "potentially objectionable" content from the off. Advertisers themselves will be given account-level tools to exclude specific sites and channels from all of their campaigns at once, as well as more fine-tuned controls for when advertisers need specific say over where their ads appear. Third, Schindler writes that advertisers and agencies will be offered "more transparency and visibility on where their ads are running". That should help advertisers avoid awkward situations like those that prompted the boycott in the first place, where advertisers only discovered their ads were showing up on extremist content after a Times report. The Google executive also promises to hire "significant numbers of people," as well as bring in new AI-powered tools, to increase the company's capacity to review questionable content for advertising. Google's new offering comes after a rare apology from the company. Its UK head, Matt Brittin, told the Advertising Week Europe conference in London that "When anything like that happens, we don't want it to happen, you don't want it to happen, and we take responsibility for it … So I want to start by saying sorry. We apologize." It is not yet clear whether the new measures go far enough to reassure advertisers. The BBC, L'Oréal, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Audi, Channel 4 and the Guardian are among the firms to suspend advertising. The company's role in funding extreme content has come under scrutiny, in part prompted by the victory of Donald Trump in 2016's US election. That led to a focus on so-called "Fake News," many of the purveyors of which rely on Google's advertising products for monetizing their hoax content. A grassroots campaign, Sleeping Giants, has also begun directly pressurizing advertisers in the US and Europe to pull their spend from "racist websites," with a particular focus on the far-right outlet Breitbart. © 2017 Guardian Web syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

MORE IN SALES & MARKETING New Sales Navigator Edition Debuts Walmart Is Acquiring ModCloth Social Media Sharers Most Important EBay Doubling Down on Ad Biz Beware Social Media 'Brandjacking' Next Article > LinkedIn Jumps into CRM with New Sales Navigator Edition By Jef Cozza / Top Tech News. Updated March 21, 2017. Business social network LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, took a major step into the customer relationship management (CRM) sector today with the announcement that it would be adding a new enterprise edition to its Sales Navigator service. The new version of the software adds several features designed to help salespeople use LinkedIn as a social selling platform to generate sales leads. That includes the ability to send up to 50 messages through the platform’s InMail system, improved manageability features, such as Single Sign-On, and something the company is calling TeamLink Extend, which aims to make it easier for LinkedIn members to search for contacts within their organizations that could introduce them to prospects at potential client companies. Social Selling "Until now, if you were looking for a warm introduction to a lead, you could go through your personal LinkedIn connections, or use TeamLink, which pools the networks of all the Sales Navigator seat holders in your company," Doug Camplejohn, LinkedIn sales solutions head of product, wrote in a blog post. "But we know your reps are probably not connected on LinkedIn to the vast majority of employees at your company, and not every employee in your company needs a seat of Sales Navigator (as much as we’d like that)." Camplejohn said TeamLink Extend solves that problem by allowing anyone in an organization to connect their own network of contacts to their company’s TeamLink pool. "That means, if you’re trying to reach a prospect, you can quickly see if anyone in your company has a connection with that person, and reach out to your colleague to ask for a warm introduction," Camplejohn said. The Enterprise Edition license will include 1000 seats for TeamLink Extend, the company added. LinkedIn is also integrating its PointDrive service into the new edition. The company acquired PointDrive, which allows salespeople to share sales content such as presentation and other documents with prospective clients, last year. PointDrive will now come bundled with both the Enterprise and Team editions of Sales Navigator, the company said. Integrating CRM But PointDrive is not the only thing LinkedIn is integrating into Sales Navigator. It is also increasing integration between the service and CRM systems. Sales Navigator will now include writeback functionality, allowing users to automatically sync their Sales Navigator activities with their CRM systems without having to enter the data in manually. "As you take notes, send InMails or even place calls from the Sales Navigator mobile app for iOS and Android, you can now write them as activities to your CRM with a simple mouse click," Camplejohn said. "For Sales and Operations leaders that want their reps' Sales Navigator activity recorded in the CRM, they now have an easy, authorized way to do it." CRM Sync will be available for use with the Salesforce CRM platform at launch, while LinkedIn said it will be adding additional CRM platforms in the future.

The British government and a handful of top firmspulled their adverts after they appeared alongside extremist content. Published: 16:45 March 21, 2017 AFP   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE LONDON Google, which has seen a slew of companies withdraw ads after they appeared alongside extremist content, said on Tuesday it was introducing new tools to give firms greater control. “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values,” Google’s chief business officer Philipp Schindler said in a post on the internet giant’s blog. “So starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content.” The move came a day after an apology by a senior Google executive following the British government and a handful of top firms including Marks and Spencer and HSBC bank pulling their adverts after they appeared alongside extremist content on its internet platforms, particularly its video-sharing site YouTube. The British arm of Havas, one of the world’s top advertising agencies that manages the accounts of numerous leading firms, suspended such advertising last week. Others to pull the plug, temporarily at least, are the BBC, Guardian newspaper group and McDonalds UK. The British government put its YouTube advertising on hold on Monday, saying “it is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content — and that message was conveyed very clearly to Google.” A Marks and Spencer spokesman said: “In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through.” Related Links Facebook, Google paying more tax in Australia The Times reported last week that BBC programmes were promoted alongside videos posted by American white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke as well as videos by Wagdi Ghoneim, an Islamist preacher banned from the UK for inciting hatred. The newspaper said an analysis it conducted found more than 200 anti-Semitic videos, and that Google failed to remove six of them within the 24-hour period mandated by the EU when it anonymously signalled their presence. ‘Hard look’ at content Schindler said in his post that Google “is taking a hard look at our existing community guidelines to determine what content is allowed on” YouTube, and will tighten safeguards to ensure that ads show up only against legitimate creators. A boycott by firms worried about damaging their image could cause serious harm to Google as advertising makes up the overwhelming majority of the internet giant’s revenue. Unaudited figures from Google’s parent company Alphabet indicated that advertising accounted for nearly 86 per cent of the company’s $26.1 billion in revenues in the final quarter of last year. Schindler said Google acknowledged that companies have brand guidelines which dictate where and when they want their ads to appear, and that it wants to give them more control to do that. “In the coming days and months, we’re introducing new tools for advertisers to more easily and consistently manage where their ads appear across YouTube and the web,” said Schindler. He pledged Google would hire significant numbers of people and harness its latest developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning to review questionable content for advertising. He added the firm would be able to resolve cases of advertising appearing alongside inappropriate content “in less than a few hours”.

Every time you ask Siri for directions, a complex chain of cutting-edge code is activated. It allows "her" to understand your question, find the information you’re looking for, and respond to you in a language that you understand. This has only become possible in the last few years. Until now, we have been interacting with computers in a way that they understand, rather than us. We have learned their language. But now, they’re learning ours. The technology underpinning this revolution in human-computer relations is Natural Language Processing (NLP). And it’s already transforming BI, in ways that go far beyond simply making the interface easier. Before long, business transforming, life changing information will be discovered merely by talking with a chatbot. This future is not far away. In some ways, it's already here. What Is Natural Language Processing? NLP, otherwise known as computational linguistics, is the combination of Machine Learning, AI, and linguistics that allows us to talk to machines as if they were human. Think about how until a few years ago, effective Google searching was achieved by using exactly the right keywords structured with Boolean search terms: AND, OR, and NOT. To get the answers you wanted out of Google, you had to know its language. Then, Google introduced semantic search. Its algorithm learned associations between words, enabling you to ask it a question the same way you would a friend. Internally, it translated that question into a Boolean structured search that it understood – but the process was invisible. It’s the same technology that allows you to ask Siri what the weather is today or what the cheapest flight to Borneo is tomorrow, without modifying your English into computational logic gates. Simply ask, What’s the cheapest flight to Borneo tomorrow? and Siri “understands,” trawling airlines for flights from your location to Borneo, comparing cost parameters to find the lowest. Siri understands “tomorrow” and “cheapest” without you having to specify the date or define “cheapest” as the lowest price. These examples are relatively nascent. Although impressive, they can still be frustratingly hit and miss, and when they hit it’s because your question can be answered with highly structured data. But NLP aims to eventually render GUIs — even UIs — obsolete, so that interacting with a machine is as easy as talking to a human. This will have tremendous ramifications for BI usage. NLP Will Democratize Data The biggest consequence will be the lowering, or complete removal, of the barrier to entry for BI and Big Data in general. Many companies in the BI space are taking notice of this trend and are making strides to ensure data is becoming more and more user-friendly and easily accessible. However, there’s still a way to go. Imagine, for example; you’re able to get answers to important questions anytime, anywhere, just by asking a question. By turning BI into a conversation with a chatbot, accessing information will be as easy as asking – ‘how have revenues changed over the last three-quarters?’ – rather than needing years of experience, and familiarity with the software, to understand how to ask the question to get the data you need. It will also make it easier to access on the go as the need for a GUI is removed. Queries can be made by text or voice command on smartphones; the processing is taken care of in the cloud. Google might tell you today what the weather will be tomorrow. But soon enough, you’ll be able to ask your personal data chatbot about customer sentiment today and how they’ll feel about your brand next week, all while walking down the street. NLP Will Make BI More Insightful Currently, NLP tends to be based on turning natural language into machine language. However, as the technology matures — especially the AI component — the computer will get better at “understanding” the query and start to deliver answers rather than search results. This is one step further from asking the question in natural language. It’s receiving it that way too. Initially, the data chatbot will probably take a question like, How have revenues changed over the last three-quarters? and return pages of data for you to analyze. Once it learns the semantic relations and inferences of the question, it will be able to automatically perform the filtering and organization necessary to provide an intelligible answer rather than simply showing you data. You won’t just ask the question in natural language. NLP Will Harness Unstructured Data NLP expands the scope of what that answer may rest on by making unstructured data understandable to a machine. Early attempts at sentiment analysis already go beyond detecting when, for example, a tweet is about your business, to analyzing the surrounding text and determining whether that tweet is positive, negative, or neutral. As speech recognition improves, audio and video will become increasingly accessible sources, as well. It’s still the early days. Think of today’s sentiment analysis as the sort of accuracy you get when using Google Translate to decode a German news article (a process that relies heavily on aspects of NLP itself.) IBM’s Watson, which is at the forefront of sentiment analysis, can currently only detect joy, fear, sadness, disgust, and anger. Humans feel many more emotions than these. Well, most do. As Watson & Co. become more nuanced, NLP opens up the enormous troves of publicly available multimedia for mass analysis by machine, taking data that previously required a human eye to interpret and spitting out either quantitative answers, natural language answers, or both. Hiring a Personal Data Assistant The interface by which all this will be achieved is similar to the customer service chat bots you see on websites today. Depending on the program, it may straddle your other applications, integrating your BI analytics into every aspect of your business and offering data-driven analytics at every point of the day. Imagine your BI chatbot hovering in the corner, like the old Word paperclip (but good), ready to answer questions within a Slack chat, within a Skype meeting, or in preparation for an event in your Outlook Calendar. Rather than asking yourself, Who was my best sales performer this year? and clicking through your data to find the answer, you’ll be able to simply ask the chatbot that question and it will give you the answer as easily as if you were asking a friend on Whatsapp. Hortonworks DataFlow is an integrated platform that makes data ingestion fast, easy, and secure.

That’s according to Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, who on Tuesday outlined a series of steps the internet giant is taking in response to an uproar in the U.K. after advertisers and agencies discovered that some of their ads ran against YouTube videos from white supremacists and other hate-mongers. As a result, several British marketers and even the U.K. government have pulled business from Google and YouTube. “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values,” Schindler wrote in the blog post. “So starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content.” YouTube’s community guidelines already broadly forbid users from posting hate speech, which it defines as content “that promotes or condones violence against individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, nationality, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity,” or whose primary purpose is “inciting hatred” on the basis of those attributes. Now, according to Schindler, the YouTube team is considering being even more aggressive in blocking offensive material from being hosted on the site. Related YouTube Says Some LGBTQ Videos Were ‘Incorrectly Labeled’ as Objectionable Content Google’s attempt at damage control on the issue comes after U.K. advertisers have responded with outrage after their brand messages appeared with objectionable content. Last week the Guardian reported that it had discovered some of its ads on YouTube had been placed with such content as videos by American white nationalists, including former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, and a hate preacher banned in the U.K. “Recently, we had a number of cases where brands’ ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologize,” Schindler wrote. According to Schindler, Google’s stepped-up measures will run across three fronts: updating its ad policies, better enforcement of those policies, and new controls for advertisers. On the policies front, Google will be removing ads “more effectively” from content that attacks or harasses people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. That change also “will enable us to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites,” according to Schindler. Google also will “tighten safeguards” to ensure ads show up only against legitimate creators in the YouTube Partner Program, as opposed to those who impersonate other channels or violate community guidelines. Google also is vowing to improve controls for advertisers to manage where their ads appear across YouTube and Google’s ad networks. That’s set to include changing default settings for ads so that they show only on content that meets a higher level of brand safety and excludes potentially objectionable content. In addition, Google said, it will roll out new account-level controls to make it easier for advertisers to exclude specific sites and channels from all of their AdWords for Video and Google Display Network campaigns. “We’ll offer advertisers and agencies more transparency and visibility on where their ads are running, and in the coming months we’ll expand availability of video-level reporting to all advertisers,” Schindler wrote. Google plans to hire “significant numbers” of people to tackle the job, he said, as well as develop new tools to increase its capacity to review questionable content for advertising. “In cases where advertisers find their ads were served where they shouldn’t have been, we plan to offer a new escalation path to make it easier for them to raise issues,” Schindler wrote, with the company aiming to soon be able to resolve such cases “in less than a few hours.” At the same time it’s moving to make sure advertisers don’t get any unexpected surprises about where their ads show up, Google will “act carefully, preserving the value we currently provide to advertisers, publishers and creators of all sizes,” Schindler added.

Michelle Siu/The Globe and Mail Billion-dollar breakout Has this man discovered the formula for creating high-tech superstars? Sean Silcoff goes inside a bold experiment at the University of Toronto to find out Sean Silcoff TORONTO The Globe and Mail Last updated: Saturday, Mar. 18, 2017 11:39AM EDT Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Comments Cian O’Sullivan is the picture of confidence as he speaks to a packed lecture hall at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. A tall, lantern-jawed man, Mr. O’Sullivan begins his presentation with a slick video explaining the genius idea developed by Beagle Inc., his Kitchener, Ont.-based startup. Using artificial intelligence (AI), Beagle’s software reviews dense contracts and other legal documents and roots out critical information in minutes. Most of the 30 million small- and medium-sized businesses in North America don’t use lawyers for commercial deals; Beagle’s product saves them hours of aggravation. The founder throws out some impressive numbers and names. Already, it has 750 customers and prospective investors have shown “an immense amount of interest,” he tells the Rotman crowd. So have Volkswagen AG and Thomson Reuters Corp.; Mr. O’Sullivan is spending 20 per cent of his time working on these new giant customer leads. Everything seems to be going Mr. O’Sullivan’s way on this mid-April, 2016, day – that is, until the audience starts barking questions. John Harris, a retired steel magnate, asks why Beagle only charges $83 per month. If it works, that’s too low, he says. Barney Pell, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor who once led U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s AI branch, says Mr. O’Sullivan should raise much more than the $400,000 (U.S.) he’s seeking or investors won’t take him seriously. “Right now you’re in no-man’s land,” Mr. Pell says. Mike Serbinis, one of Canada’s most successful tech entrepreneurs, says Beagle must decide if it’s going after small or large customers, but not both. Others agree: Beagle has a focus problem. “I just want to know what kind of business this is,” says Shivon Zilis, a partner with San Francisco venture-capital firm Bloomberg Beta. Watching the scene unfold is the man who designed this interrogation chamber for entrepreneurs: Ajay Agrawal, one of Canada’s foremost business academics and founder of Creative Destruction Lab (CDL), a ground-breaking program for startups housed at Rotman. CDL has accomplished what few incubators of technology startups in Canada have managed to do, already making a major impact on a teeming startup ecosystem. Now in its fifth year, it has developed a promising method for helping early stage companies- many of them using AI and other leading-edge technology – to grow, flourish and attract private capital. Mr. Agrawal’s aspirations go far beyond that, however. He also hopes that what the CDL team has created can point the way to a solution for a problem that has vexed our economy for decades: our sputtering ecosystem for innovation. Canada is blessed with excellent research universities and a strong pool of engineering and technical talent. Where we often stumble is in the process of turning bright ideas into cash, and spinning out technology businesses that can grow to become global players. Since Nortel Networks Corp. went bankrupt and BlackBerry Ltd. flamed out, there has been a shortage of truly large anchor companies in the Canadian tech sector. That will have to change if Canada is going to have an economy built on the jobs of the future. With the federal government set to unveil what has been described as an “innovation budget” next week, perhaps CDL’s most impressive accomplishment is that it isn’t part of a grand public-sector innovation strategy, nor based on a recommendation from one of the many past reports on improving Canada’s spotty record for commercializing technology. Rather, CDL has acted like a startup itself, driven by ingenuity and purpose and managed by a skeleton staff on a shoestring budget mostly financed by the private sector and individuals . At the time of Mr. O’Sullivan’s presentation last spring, Beagle was one of 13 AI firms left in CDL’s machine-learning program, down from 25 that started the previous fall. All were trying to build new businesses around algorithms that can learn on their own, rather than just perform tasks programmed by humans. To stay in the program, Mr. O’Sullivan and the other fledgling entrepreneurs had to convince at least one of the “mentors” – accomplished businesspeople who act as advisers, objective setters and judges – that it’s worth devoting four hours out of their busy schedules to Beagle over the next eight weeks. If none are willing, participants are booted out of the program. “When they come here most [CDL companies] are science projects,” Mr. Agrawal says following the session. “By the time we get to this meeting” – the fourth day-long session out of five over the course of nine months – “they are ready to raise a seed round of capital.” That explains why the 60-odd observers in the room include several San Francisco-area venture capitalists. Their presence “is an important indicator” of CDL’s success, said founding partner Dan Debow. “It tells you they’re not coming to do you a favour, they’re coming to do themselves a favour.” Some liken CDL to a cross between Survivor and Dragon’s Den because most firms that start get cut. That comparison irks the cerebral and serious Mr. Agrawal. Dragon’s Den “rewards the ability to pitch,” Mr. Agrawal said. “CDL rewards an ability to perform … our ratings are the success of these companies.” If so, CDL is a huge hit. Mr. Agrawal’s initial goal was to see CDL alumni create a combined $50-million in equity value after five years. That’s how he sold the program to early benefactors, including Mr. Debow and Mr. Harris, tech entrepreneurs Michael and Richard Hyatt and ex-Research In Motion Ltd. chief financial officer Dennis Kavelman, who each donated $300,000 to get CDL started. CDL has already surpassed that goal – 20 times over. Leading the way is Thalmic Labs Inc. of Waterloo, Ont., a maker of wearable technology that was one of the first companies to go through the lab in 2012-13. Thalmic raised $120-million (U.S.) last year from Intel Capital, Amazon’s Alexa Fund and others. Much of Thalmic’s early guidance and funding came from CDL mentors. Even without Thalmic, CDL would be a success: Other CDL graduate firms are valued at about $500-million combined and sell such eclectic innovations as anti-frost coatings, low-energy display lights and speech-analysis software that detects the onset of dementia. It’s still too early to know if any will break out and emerge into significant enterprises; startups typically need seven to 10 years to reach that point. Now, like a startup entrepreneur, Mr. Agrawal wants CDL to build on its early success and expand into something significant. This year, the program welcomed 100 companies – half of them focused on machine-learning. It expanded to the University of British Columbia, where “Creative Destruction Lab West” boasts early Yahoo president Jeff Mallett as a mentor. It has fielded interest from Dalhousie University in Halifax, the University of Calgary’s Haskayne School of Business and New York University to host similar offshoots. Companies have flown in from France, Israel, Boston, New York and even Silicon Valley to participate. But there’s no time to waste: Canada’s early lead in the now hot area of machine learning, a type of AI, has eroded somewhat as U.S. giants swooped to snap up leading Canadian scientists and startups. Google, Microsoft and their ilk have set themselves up to be big beneficiaries of Canada’s AI talent pool. Mr. Agrawal says now is the time to act on another field where Canada has built an early lead before the industry giants clean up: quantum computing. It’s an emerging field based on a still developing technology that harnesses the power of subatomic particles. Quantum computers are expected to one day be significantly faster than the most sophisticated machines on the planet, enabling researchers to solve complex problems beyond current capabilities. If things break as Mr. Agrawal hopes, Canada could hold that lead. To help, he’s set this spring to announce a CDL stream exclusively centred on companies developing quantum computing-based AI companies. “Our mission is that by 2020 the quantum-machine-learning initiative will have produced more, well-capitalized, revenue-generating quantum machine learning software companies than the rest of the world combined, and majority will be based in Canada,” Mr. Agrawal says. “We have a model that works for building companies, but we are still in catchup mode.” Ajay Agrawal at a Creative Destruction Lab session. Handout Doubling down on global leaders The idea for Creative Destruction Lab came to Mr. Agrawal during a dinner in Toronto about five years ago. The topic that evening was what Canada could do to improve its woeful record for harnessing Canadian ingenuity to stimulate economic growth. This was familiar ground for Mr. Agrawal, now 47, an expert on innovation economics and one of Rotman’s most popular professors; he’d attended an “endless number” of government-sponsored panels, round tables and meetings on the subject during his career, and many of the usual suspects were in attendance, including CEOs of some of Canada’s largest companies. But something bothered him that night. Everyone at the table “was very deferential” to the CEOs “who were talking about how important innovation was,” he said. “But they hadn’t really done anything that’s innovative.” Rather, it was the scientists in attendance who were the true innovators, including regenerative medicine expert Molly Shoichet, quantum computing and robotics visionary Geordie Rose, and Steve Mann, a pioneer in wearable computers. “I thought to myself, ‘In this room … everyone is focused on the bank CEOs, but as soon as we go global, they’re not really that relevant – and the other people here are.’ A light went off and I realized, ‘OK, we need to double down on the people who are global leaders and they’re not the ones everyone else in the country is focused on.’” That lightbulb moment had been 20 years in the making. Over the course of his academic research Mr. Agrawal, who studied engineering before earning his PhD in strategy and economics at UBC had focused on why most universities struggle to help their research scientists achieve commercial success from their inventions. That was a particularly acute problem in Canada. This country’s 36 leading research universities earned a combined $62-million (Cdn) in licensing income from campus inventions in 2015, according to the Association of University Technology Managers, a paltry fraction of the billions of dollars in on-campus research expenditures annually. By comparison, U.S. commercialization powerhouses Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA. and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology alone last year brought in $94.2-million (U.S.) and $62-million in licensing income, respectively. It wasn’t that Canadian scientists were less inventive than their U.S. counterparts; in a 2008 paper, Mr. Agrawal found U of T scientists disclosed as many inventions per capita as those at MIT. However, the “technology transfer” system whereby Canada’s top research university helped campus inventors commercialize their research breakthroughs was less efficient than MIT’s as there were fewer patent applications, issued patents and licensing income, he wrote. When Mr. Agrawal broadened the study to 160 Canadian and U.S. universities, he found a similar gap between the two countries. “In Canada we have a lot of important technical breakthroughs,” Mr. Agrawal said. “But we have comparatively very little capital flowing in to commercialize those. That begs the question, ‘Why?’” He rejected conventional wisdom that Silicon Valley had better ideas, smarter people and more money. The main reason for the gap, he believed from his years of research, was what he described as a lack of good judgment in Canada – judgment that was essential to help scientists turn into successful entrepreneurs. That key ingredient was in abundance in Silicon Valley’s established technology commercialization ecosystem. Mr. Agrawal cited a compelling example to make his point. A 1997 e-mail in Stanford’s archives shows a campus graduate student working through a potential deal to license technology he has developed to early Internet company Excite. The student writes to Stanford’s technology transfer office that he is willing to sign over rights for Excite to use his technology in exchange for a salary. He figures his time is worth $100,000 a year.But his e-mail also reveals someone named “Vinod” has advised him to instead buy a company that would own the technology. The “punchline,” Mr. Agrawal said, is that the technology in question was Google’s search algorithm. The student was Larry Page, who co-founded Google a year later. “Vinod” was venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, whose early backing helped to turn Google (now Alphabet Inc.) into the world’s second most valuable public company. “The most remarkable thing about [Mr. Page’s] e-mail is how unremarkable it is,” Mr. Agrawal said. “There’s not an ounce of genius there. That could have been from a computer science student [anywhere in Canada]. In my view, the only reason this turned into a company the way it did is because of the judgment from people like Vinod.” Canadian venture capitalist Haig Farris, centre, provides feedback at a Creative Destruction Lab session. Handout The market for judgment Mr. Agrawal started to develop an idea he called the “market for judgment.” He wanted to bring together some of the sharpest and shrewdest investors to advise cutting-edge Canadian research scientists and help them build companies around their technology breakthroughs, providing them with the kind of business guidance Mr. Khosla had shared with Google’s co-founder. “The problem is if you are a person who needs judgment – like a PhD in computer science who’s come up with a new way to organize the world’s information online. You can’t go down to Bay Street and buy five units of judgment. It’s not for sale. And therein lies the problem. [Creating that market] became the essence of the Creative Destruction Lab.” The academic began developing the idea with a small group that included his former UBC entrepreneurship professor and pioneering Canadian venture capitalist Haig Farris, the late Osler, Harcourt & Hoskin LLP technology lawyer Geoff Taber, and Dan Debow, a successful Toronto tech entrepreneur and Rotman alumnus that Mr. Agrawal had met through Next 36, a program the professor had helped create to expose bright Canadian undergraduate students to entrepreneurs. Mr. Debow initially told him the world didn’t need another accelerator, to which Mr. Agrawal replied, “‘Well, I don’t want to build that, I want to build something different,’” Mr. Debow recalled. Unlike most accelerators and incubators, CDL wouldn’t offer companies free office space nor take an equity stake. This was meant to be a purely altruistic venture “that emphasized something very specific: the judgment mechanism,” Mr. Debow said. Mr. Agrawal also had a distinct idea how he program’s success would be measured: not by number of jobs or startups generated – a typical yardstick – but equity value created by CDL companies as they raised money. “That’s how investors measure the success or failure of their investments,” said Mr. Debow. To build one side of the judgment market, Mr. Agrawal felt it was crucial to take a different approach to mentorship. While mentors are a common feature of incubators and accelerators, “they generally fall into two categories,” said Mr. Agrawal: people who were “well-meaning but haven’t really built a significant business,” or “the occasional superstar mentor” who was typically too busy to provide much help. “We wanted judgment that was neither mediocre-and-highly committed, nor superstar-but-not-committed. We wanted superstars that were committed.” Mr. Agrawal set out to assemble a stellar group of seven entrepreneurs – the G7, as he called them – who had built successful businesses from scratch through to a successful sale or public offering, and who would be willing to commit five full days to CDL, spread out over the program’s nine months. “Time is the most valuable thing they have,” he said. He was also wanted them to put skin in the game by investing in CDL companies they liked, though he made a handful of exceptions for entrepreneurs whose companies hadn’t yet paid out from a sale or IPO, such as Geordie Rose, a former UBC classmate who had gone on to co-found quantum-computer maker D-Wave Systems. The G7 would be matched with an initial annual cohort of 23 early stage companies, sourced from mentors, benefactors, the Next 36, other accelerators and, most of all, university science labs. When they met, the G7 would collectively determine three short-term goals judged to be the most likely milestones to advance each CDL startup. The firms would then have eight weeks to deliver. If they couldn’t they would be out. If they did, they’d get three more objectives to meet eight weeks later. At any meeting, the G7 could invest – or vote them out. Every meeting, at least one company would be automatically cut. “We knew half [of the CDL startups] probably wouldn’t make it through,” said Mr. Agrawal, noting yet another difference from other startup assistance programs. “It turned out to be less than that.” Inside the workspace at Thalmic Labs in 2013. Tim Fraser/The Globe and Mail Thalmic for the win Mr. Debow, Wind Mobile founder Tony Lacavera and the Hyatt brothers were among those who signed up as mentors and financial supporters. Mr. Agrawal had further success wooing other mentors through Canada’s tight-knit tech sector, including Mr. Serbinis and Calgary entrepreneur Chen Fong, who were sold on his pitch that they could make a meaningful contribution to Canada. Many were impressed by the company they’d be keeping. “I say no to almost everything,” said Ted Livingston, co-founder of popular Waterloo-based mobile instant messaging service Kik and an early G7 member. “I just looked at the entrepreneurs [Mr. Agrawal assembled] and was like, ‘Wow, yes. I would be honoured.’ I thought this was one of the highest densities of great people I’ve ever seen.” But when he asked U of T and Rotman for help, Mr. Agrawal said “we didn’t get a nickel.” The extent of Rotman’s support was allowing him to book rooms in the building. “This was really happening despite the university. We weren’t really doing anything that fit within the university mould,” said Mr. Agrawal. (To date, CDL has received $2.5-million from individuals, $900,000 from companies, and $400,000 from the publicly funded Ontario Centres of Excellence) The plan came together within months and the first CDL cohort started in the fall of 2012. Almost immediately, several of the G7, including Mr. Debow, got excited about Thalmic, which just months earlier had been a mechatronics class project at University of Waterloo to make a gesture-control armband guided by electrical signals of a user’s muscles. That December Thalmic closed a $1.1-million seed financing round. “A big chunk of that came from the G7 and others they introduced us to,” Thalmic CEO Stephen Lake said. “One of the first value-adds was that not only were we getting advice from people in the room but they actually were writing cheques and becoming investors.” The following June, Thalmic raised another $14.5-million; Boston’s Spark Capital, an early backer of Slack and Twitter, and Intel Capital led the deal. “I feel comfortable saying we can put [Thalmic] in the win column,” said Mr. Debow, who joined the board. The Creative Destruction Lab in March, 2017. Michelle Siu/The Globe and Mail Just-in-Time MBA Far from celebrating CDL’s early successes, however, Mr. Agrawal took the approach of an entrepreneur, tinkering to make it better. He recruited world-renowned U of T professors including Ms. Shoichet and Mr. Mann to act as CDL “chief scientists,” testing technology brought in by the startups. He asked professional services firms including Osler and Ernst & Young Global Ltd. to advise the startups. Additional observers, dubbed “G7 Associates,” were invited to participate. These carefully curated guests – “we look for community builders, not lone wolves,” Mr. Agrawal said – included venture capitalists such as Mr. Farris and successful entrepreneurs who were expected to provide feedback, introductions and even funding to the startups. He also changed how the G7 weeded out CDL companies. At first the selection was done by a show of hands after each meeting. Mr. Agrawal didn’t like that, so the G7 was instead asked if they’d be willing to devote four hours of their time to each startup over the following eight weeks. If just one put up a hand, the startup would stay. “The best voting mechanism is individual conviction,” Mr. Agrawal said. Committing four hours “makes it expensive for them to raise their hands.” That proved to be the saving grace for some. Mr. Livingston took to two founders in CDL’s second year who were developing a robot tea dispenser called teaBOT. Their rough prototype looked like a high school science project but Mr. Livingston was intrigued by the team: one was a U of T aerospace robotics engineering PhD candidate who loved to build machines, and the Kik founder wanted to see what they could accomplish. “I just believed in these people,” Mr. Livingston said. He alone voted to keep them in initially. At each successive meeting the prototype and pitch improved, and several G7s ultimately invested. There are now 17 teaBOTs in service, including machines in three “365 by Whole Foods” stores. The biggest change came at the behest of steel magnate John Harris, a founding donor and regular observer of CDL meetings. He was learning from the CDL sessions himself and said “It’s crazy this is happening right here in a business school and there is not a single MBA student in the room,” Mr. Agrawal recalled. Mr. Agrawal and a PhD student designed a self-directed course for CDL’s second year whereby students did standard MBA analysis, observing the startup-G7 interactions and producing slides with prim recommendations. Mr. Debow called it “a lot of wasted effort, a classic MBA make-work project. Their insights were not that helpful.” But there was such a surge in demand from students and inquiries to admissions about CDL the following year that Rotman administrators took notice. That coincided with the arrival of new dean, former Bank of Canada deputy governor Tiff Macklem in July, 2014. After giving many high-level speeches over the years about Canada’s chronically stagnant productivity, Mr. Macklem quickly embraced CDL for the impact it was having. The dean has since thrown Rotman’s support behind the program and the launch in 2015 of an annual CDL machine learning conference, promoting the lab publicly and meetings with government and business. “CDL is very results-oriented but it’s also an experiment in how you teach entrepreneurship and how you actually accelerate companies,” Mr. Macklem said. “It’s working, and there are not enough examples of accelerators that are truly working.” To improve the MBA class in the third year, Mr. Agrawal decided to get students directly involved by working with the startups. Now young companies led by scientists with limited business know-how had access to “this team of super motivated, super engaged, highly talented MBAs working for them,” Mr. Debow said. Forget reading stale Harvard Business School case studies: students were now living real-time case studies. “They’re not doing an academic exercise, they’re taking their academic tools and applying it to a real problem – and it’s a problem the founders and the G7 care about,” Mr. Agrawal said. Meanwhile their professors were expected to write class notes based on the latest challenges CDL startups faced, not just wheeling out well-worn lectures. One visiting academic from Harvard called it “just-in-time education.” The CDL course became “the most competitive at Rotman to get into,” said Mr. Agrawal. “It was one of the most beneficial classes I had,” said Sasha Kucharczyk, who took the CDL course as an MBA student in 2013-14. “It taught you to think and act differently [to] help you attack and execute on abstract problems [to get] meaningful results.” Two years later he entered his startup Preteckt, which uses AI software to predict when heavy vehicles will need maintenance, into CDL.

Mr. Agrawal, who acts as master of ceremonies, runs a tight ship. He asks everyone in the room to describe themselves in one sentence – and cuts off anyone who lingers. One by one the 13 startups still in the program get up for their 30-minute slots. Each firm is introduced by a mentor who revisits how they’ve performed and proposes the next three objectives. Most of the discussion is among the associates and Mr. Agrawal, who pick over the companies as if talking about specimens while their founders stand awkwardly at the front, occasionally responding to pointed questions. “I’m really not sure yet about the company,” says Mr. Pell, the former NASA AI head, of Heuritech, a startup from Paris that assesses social media posts using AI to determine fashion trends. “They’re smart people,” he says of the team of four AI and machine learning PhDs. “My concern is: how big is the business opportunity?” In 2015-16, for the first time there are two CDL streams, with this one focused exclusively on startups based on “machine learning,” a form of AI where algorithms automatically build themselves based on big data troves fed in. (CDL has since doubled down and now runs two machine learning streams, each starting with 25 companies.) The idea was initially met with some skepticism internally that CDL was getting too narrowly focused, but it’s worked so far. Two San Francisco-based machine learning experts are mentors, known here as the ML7: Mr Pell, introduced to Mr. Agrawal a year earlier by a CDL alumnus, and Ms. Zilis of VC firm Bloomberg Beta. The machine-learning focus has also attracted interest from top U.S. venture capital firms, which regularly send partners to observe, including Bessemer Venture Partners, True Ventures, and Google Ventures. “All the companies have been very impressive,” says Adam D’Augelli, a True partner. “They have real technology and at this point will have early revenue or early product traction, which for something coming out of university is relatively rare.” One Silicon Valley early stage investment firm, FundersClub provides $50,000 to any CDL company that raises money from at least one ML7 and another $100,000. By this point some CDL companies have landed seven-figure venture financings. “There’s world class talent” in Toronto, Mr. Agrawal says. “When we built [a CDL program for machine learning], that was the first time people got on a plane from Silicon Valley to Toronto rather than the other way around. Once they make that investment, they are schlepping to Canada every quarter for a board meeting. Making a second investment is a far lower hurdle. One of the most important things we’re doing for the country is getting some of the world’s top investors to go from zero to one” in Canada. As the meetings progress, the ML7 ask who are the startups’ customers – the Beagle dilemma – what they should charge, what key positions they should fill and whether their businesses can scale into something big. “If I don’t have an understanding for how this could potentially be a billion-dollar company or if I don’t believe the founder has that ambition, I categorically can’t invest,” Ms. Zilis says later. Mr. Agrawal says there are three main startup risks: technology, market and entrepreneur. Through CDL, he says, entrepreneurs can show their technology works and determine initial market interest – while addressing the third point by showing they can steadily deliver on time-sensitive objectives. Some companies are doing well. Preteckt seems to be winning over the ML7 with news it has completed its second-generation protoypes, has installed its technology on several vehicles and is working on a letter of intent with Volvo. “I like everything they are doing,” declares ML7 and tech entrepreneur Shahram Tafazoli. The ML7 assigns Preteckt objectives to install 100 revenue-generating units, file a patent application and return with a signed letter from Volvo in the next eight weeks. Deep Genomics, meanwhile, doesn’t have a product yet, but for Silicon Valley investors, that doesn’t always matter. What Deep Genomics does have is CEO Brendan Frey, a renowned deep learning pioneer and U of T professor who is trying to apply his lab work to improve diagnostic yields. Like many AI experts who’ve started companies, he’s attracted Big Silicon Valley money at a very early stage, raising $5-million from Bloomberg Beta and others. It’s a reminder that south of the border, investors are willing to take larger, more speculative bets than more conservative Canadian VCs, who as a result miss out on the gigantic returns when some of those flyers turn into global giants. He’s the rock star of the room, looking cool and confident in a silver paisley shirt and salt-and-pepper beard. “I got on the phone with Brendan and within five minutes I said ‘You can have my money and I will help you no matter what,’” Ms Zilis says in an interview later. Brothers Alex and Eric Dolan have developed a smartwatch app that can detect when a person with epilepsy is having a seizure and alert others. The technology was inspired by their epileptic mom and 2,600 people are testing it. “We are working with people who are scared … giving them tools so they can manage their lives,” Alex Dolan tells the room. But while some ML7s praise the Dolans, they’re not convinced their Neutun Labs Inc. is a billion-dollar opportunity. One concern is that the Neutun sends out “false-positive” alarms close to half the time to emergency contacts about attacks that aren’t happening. “Can it deliver something that has value? I think it’s been nebulous,” says ML7 Moe Kermani, a Vancouver venture capitalist. Alex Dolan isn’t backing down. “I’ve found a high satisfaction among users,” he says in an emotionally charged and defensive tone. “I’m thanked profusely for it….we’re focused on the one metric that matters – growing our users and engaging with them.” Neutun is cut later that day. “The ML7 just didn’t think they could add a lot of value to the company anymore,” Mr. Agrawal explains later. He says CDL “can really only help companies that are willing to be coached.” One such company is Validere Technlogies Inc. It entered the non-machine learning CDL program in 2015-16 with technology to sniff out knockoffs of perfume brands. At the behest of the G7, Validere changed its pitch and is now a hazardous waste detection service. Alberta-based G7 Chen Fong introduced the founders to oil patch executives, securing an entree that might have otherwise taken years, and the team raised $3.3-million (U.S.) in 2016 from investors in Canada and Silicon Valley. Mr. Agrawal is particularly proud of Rotman MBA student Alyssa Randall, who “went rogue” after a machine learning company she favoured was cut early from CDL. She helped the team anyway and thanks to her efforts they have had some breakthroughs – and been accepted back into CDL for this meeting. MBAs “are viewed as suits that are overpriced and underdeliver,” Mr. Agrawal says later. Ms. Randall, on the other hand, has taken big risks and overdelivered on a long shot, rather than taking the safer route of being reassigned to a company that made it through. Her company, called Algocian, graduated from CDL and hired her. “I was really happy,” she said months later, though Algocian ultimately shut down. “It was an opportunity for me to solidify a positive reputation for the company.” As for Beagle, the company did end up graduating and focusing on larger enterprise customers, and CEO Cian O’Sullivan praised the program as “a fantastic initiative … an absolute perfect crash course for running a company.” That said, there are ways it could improve, he said months later. Not all advice he got from mentors from helpful, and Mr. O’Sullivan said he would have appreciated advice earlier on how difficult it would be “to train the marketplace” for a new type of product rather than attacking an existing market. He wondered if there were too many companies for mentors to keep track of, sometimes diluting the effectiveness of advice he received, and felt the mentors could have been more open to CDL companies airing their vulnerabilities, rather than “looking for strength after strength after strength. Highlighting weakness doesn’t fit well in that environment.” Some wonder whether CDL can replicate its success as it expands. “The real challenge is it’s all about Ajay,” said Boris Wertz, a Vancouver venture capitalist who is one of CDL West’s G7s this year. “As long as Ajay stays motivated he can create a real legacy.” CDL now faces the same challenge as any flourishing startup: not getting too cocky about its early success. “CDL’s measure of success will ultimately be 10 years in the making,”said ML7 Lisa Shields, who is now mentoring CDL West companies. Says Mr. Debow: “One of the worst Canadian diseases is to convince yourself you’re world class. Have we created Facebook yet? No? Then keep moving.” Indeed, Mr. Agrawal, who actively solicits feedback about improving CDL, hardly seems satisfied; he rejected out of hand recent suggestions CDL throw a party to celebrate its alumni hitting the $1-billion value creation mark in value. “We are so far away from achieving the mission” of improving Canada’s competitiveness, he said.

STEPHEN, South Carolina -- Eighth-grader Lakaysha Governor spends two hours on the bus getting back and forth to school each day. Thanks to a grant from Google, she can now use that time more productively and get her homework done. The aspiring forensic anthropologist is one of nearly 2,000 students in South Carolina's rural Berkeley County who will ride to school on one of 28, Google-funded, Wi-Fi-equipped school buses unveiled Monday. The tech giant also has given the school district 1,700 Chromebooks, the stripped-down laptops on which many schoolchildren now do their class and homework. As more class assignments and homework migrate online, such long bus rides have generally counted as lost time in preparing for the next school day. But Google said it hopes to help expand the use of Wi-Fi on school buses in other rural areas elsewhere around the country. Google has at least a decade-long relationship with Berkeley County, where it's invested more than US$1 billion in data center complexes since 2007, bringing more than 100 jobs. Google says it also has awarded nearly US$2 billion in grants to local schools and nonprofits. Google hopes to see the Wi-Fi program extended into other rural areas of the U.S. PREVIOUS ARTICLE Noted philanthropist passes away aged 101 NEXT ARTICLE China demand fuels African donkey slaughter Facebook Twitter Google+ Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 Titanic' actor Bill Paxton has died: family representatives 2 Philippines protests 'Madam Secretary' portrayal of leader 3 Accountants in Oscar mistake off the show 4 7 Earth-size worlds found orbiting star; could hold life 5 Historic drama 'Underground' reflects on state of the union 6 New highs for US stocks; Dow win streak longest since 1987 7 Russia gives new 'Beauty and the Beast' film a 16+ rating 8 China's Recon buys $100M majority stake in Millennium Films 9 Iconic rock arch from 'Game of Thrones' falls into Malta sea 10 US to sell 'more and better' weapons to Taiwan: report Subscribe  |   Advertise  |   RSS Feed  |   About Us  |   Career  |   Contact Us Sitemap  |   Top Stories  |   Taiwan  |   China  |   Business  |   Asia  |   World  |   Sports  |   Life  |   Arts & Leisure  |   Health  |   Editorial  |   Commentary Travel  |   Movies  |   TV Listings  |   Classifieds  |   Bookstore  |   Getting Around  |   Weather  |   Guide Post  |   Student Post  |   Terms of Use  |   Sitemap   Copyright © 1999 – 2017 The China Post.

Today, we’re getting not only new info on the features it’ll bring, but even a developer preview for those wanting to try the goods early. Some of the highlights on features include a new background limiter to make sure apps are behaving and not abusing your battery, an official API for autofill, more granular notifications to allow developers to separate notifications by type (and allowing users to subsequently customize those notifications independently), and picture-in-picture mode for phones and tablets. Stick with us through the end for the full breakdown of the new features and changes coming with Android O. For now, though, if you’re eager to get going on loading this onto your phone, you’ll want to listen up. Those with a  Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus Player can find factory images for the Android O Developer Preview right here. Google isn’t yet releasing this as an OTA beta as the company only intends to release it for developers who want to get a head start on getting their apps ready. Common users can still download and flash it, of course, but just know that the preview may be buggy and some things may not work as intended. If you don’t want to deal with any potential hassles, wait until Google has launched their automatic beta channel as this is likely to be followed by the availability of more stable builds. As was the case before, Google is looking to get this thing tightened up over the course of 4 previews, with the next being set for a May release. Developers interested in getting started with the first one right now should head here for download links and instructions. Otherwise, read on for all that’s coming to Android O straight ahead! What’s new in O? Android O introduces a number of new features and APIs to use in your apps. Here’s are just a few new things for you to start trying in this first Developer Preview: Background limits: Building on the work we began in Nougat, Android O puts a big priority on improving a user’s battery life and the device’s interactive performance. To make this possible, we’ve put additional automatic limits on what apps can do in the background, in three main areas: implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates. These changes will make it easier to create apps that have minimal impact on a user’s device and battery. Background limits represent a significant change in Android, so we want every developer to get familiar with them. Check out the documentation onbackground execution limits and background location limits for details. Notification channels: Android O also introduces notification channels, which are new app-defined categories for notification content. Channels let developers give users fine-grained control over different kinds of notifications — users can block or change the behavior of each channel individually, rather than managing all of the app’s notifications together. Notification channels let users control your app’s notification categories Android O also adds new visuals and grouping to notifications that make it easier for users to see what’s going on when they have an incoming message or are glancing at the notification shade. Autofill APIs: Android users already depend on a range of password managers to autofill login details and repetitive information, which makes setting up new apps or placing transactions easier. Now we are making this work more easily across the ecosystem by adding platform support for autofill. Users can select an autofill app, similar to the way they select a keyboard app. The autofill app stores and secures user data, such as addresses, user names, and even passwords. For apps that want to handle autofill, we’re adding new APIs to implement an Autofill service. PIP for handsets and new windowing features: Picture in Picture (PIP) display is now available on phones and tablets, so users can continue watching a video while they’re answering a chat or hailing a car. Apps can put themselves in PiP mode from the resumed or a pausing state where the system supports it – and you can specify the aspect ratio and a set of custom interactions (such as play/pause). Other new windowing features include a new app overlay window for apps to use instead of system alert window, and multi-display support for launching an activity on a remote display. Font resources in XML: Fonts are now a fully supported resource type in Android O. Apps can now use fonts in XML layouts as well as define font families in XML — declaring the font style and weight along with the font files. Adaptive icons: To help you integrate better with the device UI, you can now create adaptive icons that the system displays in different shapes, based on a mask selected by the device. The system also animates interactions with the icons, and them in the launcher, shortcuts, Settings, sharing dialogs, and in the overview screen. Adaptive icons display in a variety of shapes across different device models. Wide-gamut color for apps: Android developers of imaging apps can now take advantage of new devices that have a wide-gamut color capable display. To display wide gamut images, apps will need to enable a flag in their manifest (per activity) and load bitmaps with an embedded wide color profile (AdobeRGB, Pro Photo RGB, DCI-P3, etc.). Connectivity: For the ultimate in audio fidelity, Android O now also supports high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs such as LDAC codec. We’re also adding new Wi-Fi features as well, like Wi-Fi Aware, previously known as Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN). On devices with the appropriate hardware, apps and nearby devices can discover and communicate over Wi-Fi without an Internet access point. We’re working with our hardware partners to bring Wi-Fi Aware technology to devices as soon as possible. The Telecom framework is extending ConnectionService APIs to enable third party calling apps integrate with System UI and operate seamlessly with other audio apps. For instance, apps can have their calls displayed and controlled in different kinds of UIs such as car head units. Keyboard navigation: With the advent of Google Play apps on Chrome OS and other large form factors, we’re seeing a resurgence of keyboard navigation use within these apps. In Android O we focused on building a more reliable, predictable model for “arrow” and “tab” navigation that aids both developers and end users. AAudio API for Pro Audio: AAudio is a new native API that’s designed specifically for apps that require high-performance, low-latency audio. Apps using AAudio read and write data via streams. In the Developer Preview we’re releasing an early version of this new API to get your feedback. WebView enhancements: In Android Nougat we introduced an optional multiprocess mode for WebView that moved the handling of web content into an isolated process. In Android O, we’re enabling multiprocess mode by default and adding an API to let your app handle errors and crashes, for enhanced security and improved app stability. As a further security measure, you can now opt in your app’s WebView objects to verify URLs through Google Safe Browsing. Java 8 Language APIs and runtime optimizations: Android now supports several new Java Language APIs, including the new java.time API. In addition, the Android Runtime is faster than ever before, with improvements of up to 2x on some application benchmarks. Partner platform contributions: Hardware manufacturers and silicon partners have accelerated fixes and enhancements to the Android platform in the O release. For example, Sony has contributed more than 30 feature enhancements, including the LDAC codec, and 250 bug fixes to Android O.

Next StoryDownload: Android O Wallpaper by Tim-o-tato on Mar 21, 2017 @timotato News Home Share this Story Here’s What’s New So Far in Android O (Updated) Out of nowhere, Google released the first Developer Preview for Android O. Naturally, given this is just the first preview, it is pretty barebones, but still very exciting. If you are interested in what’s new with Android O, this post is for you.  According to Google’s overview of this build, the Android team is approaching new ways for developers and users to interact with notifications (Notification Channels), a picture-in-picture mode, many battery usage improvements, adaptive icons, font resources in XML, plus a whole lot more. Let’s get to it. UPDATE: Want to see all of the little changes in Android O? We’re compiling those at this post. UPDATE 2: Google added another new feature to the list today called Smart Sharing. Details below. Picture-in-Picture (PIP) Exactly like you find on Android TV currently, PIP mode for Android O allows users to maintain a view on select media, such a video, while still doing other things. For example, you can be watching a video, then open up another app to get some work done, but still have a window with that same video open and playing. Essentially, it’s a tweaked multi-window experience specifically for video-focused applications. Notification Channels For Android O, notification channels are app-defined categories for notification content. Sound sorta confusing? Don’t worry, it’s not. Basically, these channels will allow developers to provide users more control over different kinds of notifications. According to Google’s changelog, “Users can block or change the behavior of each channel individually, rather than managing all of the app’s notifications together.” Android O also adds new visuals and grouping actions to notifications that make it easier for users to see what’s going on when they have an incoming message or are looking at the notification shade.   Adaptive Icons For Android O, icons are getting a big custom boost, perfect for those looking to set a particular look. Stated by Google, developers can create adaptive icons that the system can display in different shapes based on a mask selected by the device. We’ve seen implementations of this from companies such as Samsung, but with it being native to Android now, users should see much better control and options. Furthermore, the system (Android O) animates interactions with the icons, like in the launcher, shortcuts, Settings menu, sharing dialogs, and in the overview screen.   Background Limits Google’s mission to make better use of a phone’s battery is continuing with Android O, with the implementation of additional automatic limits on what apps can do in the background. Specifically, three main areas are being worked on: Implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates. According to Google, “These changes will make it easier to create apps that have minimal impact on a user’s device and battery. Background limits represent a significant change in Android, so we want every developer to get familiar with them.” For consumers, that simply means we may not need to worry about certain apps killing our batteries in the background like we have done over the years. Autofill APIs Android O is including platform support for autofill, the thing that lets you fill out data and transaction forms quickly. To start, you will select an autofill application, much like you would a keyboard application. That selected autofill app stores and secures your data (addresses, names, passwords, etc.), then when needed, users can select the proper autofill option when needed. Think of it like Chrome’s autofill, but for your entire smartphone. High-Quality Bluetooth Audio Codecs and Connectivity Android O and audiophiles should be a perfect match, with Google detailing support for high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs, such as the LDAC codec. As stated by Google, “We’re also adding new WiFi features as well, like WiFi Aware, previously known as Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN). On devices with the appropriate hardware, apps and nearby devices can discover and communicate over WiFi without an Internet access point. We’re working with our hardware partners to bring WiFi Aware technology to devices as soon as possible.” Furthermore, the Telecom framework is extending ConnectionService APIs to enable 3rd-party calling apps to integrate with the System UI and operate seamlessly with other audio apps. For example, apps can have calls displayed and controlled in different kinds of UIs, like vehicle head units. NEW! Smart Sharing Android O attempts to personalize your sharing preferences even more so than they did last year with a new Smart Sharing feature. Google describes it as Android better understanding each type of content and which apps they are right for. For example, if you take a picture of a receipt, Android would suggest you share it with an expense-tracking app. Or maybe you just took a selfie, so Android would offer up social media apps to share with. Make sense? More… As you might expect, there’s a lot of little things baked into Android O, not necessarily meant to be seen by the average consumer. If you are interested in the entire list of changes, follow the via link below. If you are a developer or very frisky Android user with a compatible phone, you can find downloads for Android O here.

Mrgwaps I narrowed down my Pixel XL battery killer to Skype. disqusdeeznuts Thank you for creating one article that captures all of this information instead of making your site a cluster like AP. Very professional and an easy format to consume. Thanks again! Ben AP and AC are basically totally unreadable because they want to maximize page views at the expense of annoying the readers (by doing things like what you mentioned). I don’t go to either of those sites anymore. DL is doing it right. Stabby McKnifington AC has completely gone to hell in the last year. It used to be one of the top Android sites. Now it’s like Geocities Ben Exactly. It’d gotten worse and worse, but the straw that broke the camel’s back for me was a listicle of the top “adult-themed” apps on Google Play. That was published in December, according to a quick Google, and that’s when I had enough. I mean, if that’s your thing, that’s fine, but the mere presence of the headline started causing AdWords spots to start showing me that stuff in the web browser. Stabby McKnifington ha ha. I had the same exact thing when it was “How to view Porn in your VR unit” But I was just sick of the constant Pokemon click bait articles and the straw was the ads that basically made the site unreadable. Ben Yeah they were really Pokemon Go Central for a while there. foster_esther I was paid 104000 dollars last 12 month period by doing an on-line job furthermore I was able to do it by w­orking in my own time f­o­r several hours regularly. I utilized work opportunity I stumbled upon on the internet and also I am delighted that I was capable of to earn such decent money. It’s genuinely newbie-friendly and therefore I’m so blessed that I discovered out regarding it. Go and visit exactly what I do… http://www.cat.org.uk/snip/93439 Corey Kinard I stopped going to AC and AAuth (the worst offender hands down in my opinion) but I have to keep and open channel to AP. They’re usually the first to break news tgat everyone cites and their APK breakdowns are always entertaining. 3 pages is too much for a basic article like this. When I whitelisted then I didn’t think they’d take advantage of it. Elvis Xhelili Any idea how stable may be this build? JP Are they holding out on good major features? This looks like the same small changes that Apple has been doing in iOS for the last few years. clay what major features do you want to see? imo we are in a time where its going to be small updates for the foreseeable future. nothing big left to tackle for the most part Murphy’s Magnet Exactly. Richter Atmosphere Excited about LDAC support. Duffman Too bad most people will need to buy a new phone to get this update… Steve Hendricks Please let those app limits be the silver bullet for battery life. On my GS7, I’m astounded at how on the new ultra low power saving mode it sips battery, even with facebook (yes, I’m one of those) selected as one of my apps. I can get texts, calls, even have access to camera. This is the last area that my iOS friends are able to mock me. Ultra power saving mode is how the battery should normally behave, IMO. Rod They can also mock you on updates. Murphy’s Magnet True, but they are updating to features we’ve had for years so……. Rod Features aside, OS improvements and security fixes are important, too. Dustin Casper Guess I’m waiting for Android P based on this lol…damn. Daniel Thomas i know, right? I waiting until Android can grind my coffee beans, and then brew and pour me a cup of coffee. rmagruder Wild idea. Make it a requirement to get Play Services that your device support sub 10ms audio latency through the mic port. Maybe then we can finally get good audio recording support.

Mike Credelle i am not a developer, i just want to know if certain apps cough-s health-cough could be controlled a little more by the user dontsh00tmesanta Dont need to be a dev to do so im by no means one…just dont install the userdata portion Mike Credelle i’m not installing the first preview release of an OS (potentially full of bugs) to see if i can tweak individual apps. That’s what coming to sites like this is for, to ask people who are willing to do this or have extra phones to test with like the admins do. dontsh00tmesanta Potentially?

Are they opt-in, opt-out or always on? I read through the link, and found this nugget :”To migrate to Android O, the developer replaces the background service with a scheduled job, which is launched periodically, queries the server, then quits.” Sooo… not much different. THIS my friends is why FB DESTROYS your battery life. It is always always ALWAYS ALWAYS running. Always. Changing the “background service” to a “scheduled job,” I DOUBT will stop these apps from killing your battery life. Related: Picture in Picture will ABSOLUTELY ruin your battery life. Rich Dunajewski I ditched the FB app on the phone for this very reason. It’s always running because it’s tracking your every move to collect data on you. Biggest battery savings was when I switched to Swipe, which also lets me use FB Messenger over “web” without needing their cruddy app. Murphy’s Magnet Swipe and Metal FTW it’s me tim-cock.

Name: Subject: Message: Google officially announces Android O, Developer Preview images live now Newsby Jimmy Westenberg2 days ago 42 6765 38 Just one day after the second beta version of Android 7.1.2 Nougat arrived for Pixel and Nexus devices, Google has yet another surprise for us. The company has just announced its next version of Android, and that name, unsurprisingly, is Android O. Of course, this won’t be the final name of the next version of Android, but for now, it’s just Android O. As was the case last year with the first Android N Developer Preview, Google isn’t letting us know everything that will be included with Android O. We’ll learn more and more about the new version of Android in the weeks leading up to Google I/O 2017. But for now, let’s talk about what’s available in this first preview. One of the biggest changes in Android O is background limits, which will help your smartphone save more battery life than ever before. Basically, Google is putting additional automatic limits on what apps can and can’t do in the background, in three areas: implicit broadcasts, background services and location updates. Since these background limits represent a big change in the way Android works, developers should start getting to know them. You can check out the official documentation here and here. Now for a more visually appealing change. Android O introduces notification channels, which are app-defined categories for notification content. These channels let developers give users fine-tuned control over different types of notifications. Users can block or change the behavior of each channel individually, rather than putting the kibosh on a certain app’s notifications altogether. As you can see in the screenshots attached above, Android O also brings new visuals and grouping to these notifications. On the left you’ll see how Android Nougat’s notifications work, and the image on the right shows off Android O’s notifications. O also brings new Autofill APIs that will make setting up new apps and placing transactions easier. Users will be able to select an autofill app, similar to how you can select a keyboard app. The autofill app will store and secure user data, such as addresses, names, passwords, etc. Android O also brings a new feature that was previously only available on Android TV devices: Picture in Picture (PIP) mode. With PIP, users will be able to continue watching a video while navigating around through other applications. This is a super handy feature, and one that should be welcomed by most Android users out there. Adaptive launcher icons are also new in Android O, which can display different shapes across different devices. For example, a launcher icon can be displayed in a circular shape on one device, and be displayed in a square shape on another. Each smartphone maker provides a mask, which the system then uses to render all icons with that shape. The new icons will also be used in shortcuts, the Settings app, sharing dialogs and in the overview screen. This one should make the audiophiles happy – Android O now supports high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs such as LDAC codec. Plus, there’s a new native AAudio API that’s designed specifically for apps that require high-performance, low-latency audio. New Wi-Fi features are coming as well, like Wi-Fi Aware. Basically, apps and nearby devices can discover and communicate over Wi-Fi without an internet access point. Android O also adds better support for keyboard navigation, particularly when it comes to apps on Chrome OS. Google focused on building a more reliable model for “arrow” and “tab” navigation that aids both developers and users. Those are the biggest changes present in Android O, but as you might expect, there’s much more to it than that. You can check out all the other features and improvements at the blog post link below. So, that’s all fine and dandy, but when can you get your hands on Android O? Since this is a very, very early version of O, Google isn’t rolling this one out to devices in the Android Beta Program. You’ll have to manually download and flash the updates if you want an early look at the new version. With that said, images are now available at this link for the Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus Player and Pixel C. Google does say that O will come to the Android Beta Program as we near the final product, though, so there is hope if you’re not keen on flashing any new images to your device.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Android O Developer Preview images with Notification channels, Adaptive icons, PIP and more now available Google has released developer preview images for Android ‘O’, the next major Android release, ahead of Google I/O 2017 in May, just like it did last time for Android N. Google said that the next version of Android will bring new power and performance optimizations and many new ways to extend your apps. Android O brings several new features such as notification channels, PIP, adaptive icons, along with some of the new APIs — autofill, font resources in XML, autosizing TextView, WebView enhancements, and more. Android O is now available for Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel, Pixel XL and Pixel C devices on the Android developer website here. Stable release will be available in Q3 2017. Google said that Android Beta is not currently available for Android O, and it will be inviting consumers to try it out as well, and open up enrollments through Android Beta closer to the final release. New features in Android O Background limits:  Android O puts a big priority on improving a user’s battery life and the device’s interactive performance. Additional automatic limits on what apps can do in the background, in three main areas: implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates. This will help create apps that have minimal impact on a user’s device and battery. Notification channels: Channels let developers give users fine-grained control over different kinds of notifications — users can block or change the behavior of each channel individually, rather than managing all of the app’s notifications together.  Android O also adds new visuals and grouping to notifications that make it easier for users to see what’s going on when they have an incoming message or are glancing at the notification shade. Snoozing: Users can snooze notifications to reappear at a later time. Notifications reappear with the same level of importance they first appeared with. Apps can remove or update a snoozed notification, but updating a snoozed notification does not cause it to reappear. Autofill APIs: Android O adds platform support for autofill. Users can select an autofill app, similar to the way they select a keyboard app. The autofill app stores and secures user data, such as addresses, user names, and even passwords. For apps that want to handle autofill, new APIs are added to implement an Autofill service. PIP for handsets and new windowing features: Picture in Picture (PIP) display is now available on phones and tablets, so users can continue watching a video while they’re answering a chat or hailing a car. Apps can put themselves in PiP mode from the resumed or a pausing state where the system supports it – and you can specify the aspect ratio and a set of custom interactions (such as play/pause). Other new windowing features include a new app overlay window for apps to use instead of system alert window, and multi-display support for launching an activity on a remote display. Font resources in XML: Fonts are now a fully supported resource type in Android O. Apps can now use fonts in XML layouts as well as define font families in XML — declaring the font style and weight along with the font files. Adaptive icons:  Adaptive icons support visual effects, and can display a variety of shapes across different device models. The system also animates interactions with the icons, and them in the launcher, shortcuts, Settings, sharing dialogs, and in the overview screen. Wide-gamut color for apps: Android developers of imaging apps can now take advantage of new devices that have a wide-gamut color capable display. To display wide gamut images, apps will need to enable a flag in their manifest (per activity) and load bitmaps with an embedded wide color profile (AdobeRGB, Pro Photo RGB, DCI-P3, etc.). Connectivity: Support for high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs such as LDAC codec. Wi-Fi Aware,  which is based on the Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN) specification. On devices with the appropriate Wi-Fi Aware hardware, apps and nearby devices can discover and communicate over Wi-Fi without an Internet access point. Companion device pairing: Android O provides APIs that allow you to customize the pairing request dialog when trying to pair with companion devices over Bluetooth, BLE, and Wi-Fi. Keyboard navigation: More reliable, predictable model for “arrow” and “tab” navigation that aids both developers and end users. AAudio API for Pro Audio: AAudio is a new native API that’s designed specifically for apps that require high-performance, low-latency audio. Apps using AAudio read and write data via streams. In the Developer Preview we’re releasing an early version of this new API to get your feedback. WebView enhancements: Multiprocess mode by default and API to let your app handle errors and crashes, for enhanced security and improved app stability. As a further security measure, you can now opt in your app’s WebView objects to verify URLs through Google Safe Browsing. Java 8 Language APIs and runtime optimizations: Android now supports several new Java Language APIs, including the new java.time API. In addition, the Android Runtime is faster than ever before, with improvements of up to 2x on some application benchmarks. Partner platform contributions: Hardware manufacturers and silicon partners have accelerated fixes and enhancements to the Android platform in the O release. Sony has contributed more than 30 feature enhancements, including the LDAC codec, and 250 bug fixes to Android O.

Skip to content Home Subscribe Big Government Big Journalism Big Hollywood National Security Tech Video Sports The Wires Breitbart London Breitbart Jerusalem Breitbart Texas Breitbart California STORE Facebook Twitter RSS SHOP NOW > Google ‘Directly Engaged’ In Clinton Campaign, Says Julian Assange The Associated Press by Lucas Nolan8 Jun 20160 8 Jun, 2016 8 Jun, 2016 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER “[Google] is directly engaged in Hillary Clinton’s campaign” claimed Julian Assange at a Moscow journalism forum on Tuesday.  The Wikileaks founder who is still under investigation by the Swedish government over allegations of sexual assault was speaking via video link to the “New Era of Journalism: Farewell to Mainstream” forum in Moscow when he made the claim that tech giant Google was complicit in the running of Hillary Clinton’s digital campaign. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Specifically, Assange claimed, “The chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, set up a company to run the digital component of Hillary Clinton’s campaign.” Eric Schmidt did in fact create a company in the last quarter of 2015 called The Groundwork whose website is empty except for a single placeholder logo. Breitbart has previously reported on The Groundwork and how it was reportedly developed to install Clinton in the Oval Office. However, whether or not Google itself is a part of Schmidts’ involvement in The Groundwork remains unclear to the public. Assange pointed out that many high up Google employee names appear within Clinton’s leaked email transcripts, a searchable list of which Assange has compiled here. A name that appears with regularity is that of Jared Cohen, the founder of ‘Google Ideas’ – now rebranded as ‘Jigsaw’. Cohen’s team at Google was revealed to be working with Clinton alongside Al Jazeera in attempts to influence regime change in Syria following the publishing of Clinton’s emails by Wikileaks.  “We should understand that Google… is intensely aligned with U.S. exceptionalism… personally at the top aligned with Hillary Clinton’s election campaign and almost certainly once Hillary Clinton becomes president, those people in Google, like Jared Cohen, will be placed into positions around the new Clinton presidency” said Assange, heavily implying that Google and it’s employees could directly benefit from a Clinton presidency. Assange highlighted the alarming control that Google has over its users’ data and the information received and kept by the search engine giant. “Google controls 80 percent of the smartphone market through its control of Android and if you control the device itself – that people use to read – then anything that they connect to through that device you have control over as well.” Outside of the native OS found on Apple’s iPhone, Google’s monopoly on remaining smartphone market may be behind why companies such as Samsung are considering dropping Android in favour of their own OS.  It’s not hard to imagine how any form of manipulation of certain search returns and political polls may greatly benefit a presidential candidate or push a political agenda. If Assange is correct in his assertion that links Google to the Clinton campaign, then the search engine could have a major impact on the Presidential race. Assange also pointed out that Google has had no trouble working with the Obama administration.  “Google has gotten into bed with the Obama administration in a very significant way,” stated Assange. “It is the company that visits the White House more than any other – averaged once per week in the last 4 years.” Follow Lucas Nolan @LucasNolan_ on Twitter Read More Stories About: 2016 Presidential Race, Tech, Google, Hillary Clinton, Julian Assange, WikiLeaks Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

David Pierce Gear Date of Publication: 03.21.17. 03.21.17 Time of Publication: 1:00 pm. 1:00 pm Android O, Google’s Next OS, Is Coming to Save Your Phone’s Battery Android Apple gets all the attention, but Android remains the world’s biggest operating system. You find it everywhere, which means it absolutely must work on devices of every size, shape, and spec. Now that you can use Android apps on ChromeOS, that opens them up to gadgets with trackpads, keyboards, pens, and who knows what else. Android works in your car, on your TV, and on your face. All of which makes being an Android dev complicated, and gives Google a lot to consider as it works on upgrades. Google just released a few tidbits about the next version of Android, which arrives later this year and is known for now as Android O. (Not that I’m speculating, but Android Oreo? Android Oh Henry? Android Orange Slices Because You Should Eat Healthy Now?) No word yet on a roof-raisingly cool new feature like Assistant, but O offers enhancements that appear designed to help developers build apps for the entire Android ecosystem. The crew in Mountain View appears obviously concerned about your phone’s battery life, because Android O will keep apps from sucking down more than their fair share of juice. Android O places specific caps on “implicit broadcasts,” which wake up background apps when you connect to Wi-Fi or take a picture. It also limits what an app can do in the background. If you’ve ever checked your battery settings only to discover an app you haven’t used in three days sapped 34 percent of your power, this is very good news. If you own an entry-level phone with a small battery and poor connectivity, it is even better news. To help curb notification overload, Android O features something Google calls “notification channels” that let developers segment different kinds of notifications—political news vs. sports news, maybe, or text message alerts from your family vs. everyone else—and control them individually. The notification shade also groups notifications by channel, making skimming through them easier. Most of the other new stuff is aimed at making Android better across devices and form factors. Android O standardizes what happens when you press an arrow key on your keyboard, and supports adaptive icons that better match those on whatever screen and layout you’re looking at. It supports third-party calling apps, so you can take all your calls through WhatsApp or Telegram. Picture in Picture now works on phones and tablets, and even lets you launch windows on secondary displays. Apps can access more fonts and a wider color gamut. And, in a move sure to save the sanity of complicated-password-havers everywhere, a new Autofill API lets you use an app to fill in passwords, addresses, and more. Google won’t formally launch Android O until the I/O conference in May. Count on more features to come. Google timed this result mostly to get devs thinking and planning, and perhaps even start tinkering (Google calls it a “canary” release, which is only slightly too ominous). It provides another clear indication that Android is much more than a wildly popular mobile operating system. Google clearly considers it the everything operating system, one capable of powering your phone, your TV, your car, your tablet, your computer, your watch, your lights. Until now, Android has been an excellent phone OS haphazardly tacked onto everything else. Google hopes to make it a single platform that works and looks right, no matter what you’re looking at. It’s getting there, one adaptive icon at a time. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. android google Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News. Share Share Tweet Comment Email Skip Social.

This one is codenamed “O,” and your guess is as good as mine as to what dessert the final version will be named after. It isn’t yet available for regular users to try out. Although developers can begin testing it right away, it’s best for most people to let things stabilize a bit more before they try it out. Developers can download it today. Google isn’t yet telling us everything that’s coming in O, but the marquee feature is meant to address a perennial smartphone problem that has seen equally perennial attempts at fixing it: battery life. For O, Google is continuing its trend toward aggressively managing what apps can do in the background (as iOS has long done) to ensure that runaway processes don’t destroy your battery. As Android VP of engineering, Dave Burke, puts it: “We've put additional automatic limits on what apps can do in the background, in three main areas: implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates.” Android multitasking will work more like iOS It’s possible that these “automatic limits” could wreak some havoc on existing apps that assume a more liberal stance toward what they’re allowed to do in the background, so developers will want to check up on how it works with their particular apps. Improvements to battery life is a hard thing to judge — especially with early versions of software. So we won’t know whether Google’s strategy here will be effective on most phones for quite some time. Easier to judge: changes in the notification system in Android. It seems like notifications get tweaked with every iteration of smartphone software, but Android’s approach has generally been better than the competition’s. For O, the big change is that apps can “group” their notifications into categories called “channels.” Image: Google Image: Google That’s pretty vague, but what it sounds like is that you’ll be able to set what kind of notifications you want from each app from within Android’s main notification settings pane. So if an app offers “high-priority alerts” and “marketing,” you can turn them off directly in Android’s settings rather than digging through the app’s interface. And speaking of “vague,” Burke also says O has “new visuals and grouping to notifications that make it easier for users to see what's going on when they have an incoming message or are glancing at the notification shade.” We’ll need a bit more clarity before we can know exactly what this all means — or if it’s just random new options for developers that will get used rarely. For something as essential as notifications, it behooves Google not to mess around with the interface too much, unless there’s something genuinely great here. Here’s one great addition we just found in Google’s developer documents: you can snooze notifications so they appear at a later time, just like you do with email. That’s pretty great. Image: Google Battery and notifications are the biggest changes announced today, but there’s a grab bag of other stuff which may appeal to you. For example, Google is aiming to improve sound quality with wireless headphones with “high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs,” as well as Sony’s LDAC codec. Google is also letting app developers create “adaptive icons,” which will change their look and shape depending on what home screen theme the user has opted for. That’s either a sign that theming is going to be a bigger deal than it used to be on Android, or it’s a sign that all those Android icon packs are getting popular but are still too confusing to set up for most users. Let’s go with both. GIF: Google GIF: Google Here are a few more additions that hang together thematically, related to how stuff gets displayed or navigated on the screen: A genuine picture-in-picture mode for videos A new pop-up window that apps can use instead of the system alert window (actually that sounds terrible) “Multi-display support for launching an activity on a remote display,” which could refer to something like a PowerPoint presentation mode or a Continuum-style Android-on-the-desktop mode. Either way it sounds weird. New ways to support keyboard navigation, including especially arrow and tab button navigation Take that grouping together, and you begin to see signs that Google is pretty serious about making Android work better on Chromebooks. Of course, the current version of Android Nougat is still not available on Chrome OS. I’ve been told that the plan is not to allow Android on Chrome OS to stay a generation behind, but that after it exits beta this spring, it will be kept at parity with the current phone release. However it shakes out, it seems clear to me that Chrome OS with Android apps is Google’s strategy for big screens going forward. If there’s another Google-made flagship Android tablet, I’ll be mildly surprised. Lastly, there’s a mix of stuff that’s clearly filling out cases developers have asked for to ensure their apps feel either more professional or less of a hassle to use (or both): Autofill APIs, which will make it easier for password managers to register themselves as the official autofill app for punching in your oft-entered yet still-sensitive information into other apps Support for fonts as full Android resources, so they can be used and defined more simply in XML layouts. “Wide-gamut color for apps,” so that they can take full advantage of the stupid-good screens on flagship phones A “telecom framework” so third-party VOIP apps can act like first-class phone apps as far as the OS is concerned WebView (the thing that lets apps use the Chrome rendering engine to display web content) is going to work a little more smoothly because apps will have “multiprocess mode” enabled by default and handle crashes themselves. They can also use Google’s Safe Browsing verification to ensure users aren’t caught on phishing sites. New Java stuff, including “Java 8 APIs and runtime optimizations” and “the new java.time API.” Google also claims the “Android Runtime,” the code behind the code that runs your apps, will be “faster than ever before, with improvements of up to 2x on some application benchmarks.” Something called “Network Aware Networking,” which should allow Android devices to communicate directly with each other over Wi-Fi, even if the network isn’t connected to the internet Developers will be able to test Android O in a desktop emulator or on one of the following devices: Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C. If you want to try it, you will have to manually download and flash it yourself, rather than sign up for an over-the-air update. That’s for the best, probably: last year the first few developer previews were very much not the sort of thing you’d want to use on your primary phone, and chances are good the same is true this time around. I asked if there would be a beta this year and Google’s not saying yet — but last year it waited until Google I/O in May to release a truly public beta that made it easy for regular people to try it. Perhaps the same will happen again this year — we’ll be at Google I/O May 17th–19th to let you know if it does.

In a post on the Android Developer Blog today, Google pulled back the curtain on some of Android O’s new features and enhancements, and from the looks of it, it’s a jam-packed release.  In the past, Google has released the first developer preview of the latest Android version following its I/O keynote, and Google notes the change, saying it has been “pushing hard on improving our engineering processes so we can share our work earlier and more openly with our partners.” In the post, Google spotlights a number of new features, several of which were only recently leaked. It warns that there is “still plenty of stabilization and performance work ahead of us,” but developers can download and install the developer’s preview beginning today. O happy day: While this definitely isn’t the full list of features planned for Android O, there is a lot here that should make long-time Android fans extremely happy. Google is likely saving some main consumer features for its big conference, but even the list of enhancements here, especially background limits and the new windowing features, will have a profound effect on how we use our phones. And giving developers extra time to get their apps up to speed before the public release is great news, too. Battery saver First and foremost, Google is putting continued emphasis on improving battery life and performance, this time around focusing on the access apps have while running in the background. There are three main areas that Google has targeted for automatic limits: implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates. For users, that means apps won’t be able to drain your battery when you’re not using them anymore, and Google notes that it is a “significant change in Android, so we want every developer to get familiar with them.” It’s not entirely clear whether Google will allow users control over which apps have background permissions or limit them altogether, but either way it should help our phones last a little longer. Google Notification channels give you more control over what apps can send you. Another new feature is something Google is calling notification channels, new app-defined categories for notification content. With Channels, users will have more granular control over notifications, and it won’t be an all-or-nothing toggle for apps anymore: “Channels let developers give users fine-grained control over different kinds of notifications—users can block or change the behavior of each channel individually, rather than managing all of the app’s notifications together.” Window dressing Also new in Android O is Picture in Picture, but it’s not just for video. While users will be able to continue watching videos in a small window while they use another app, the feature, which is available for handsets and tablets, will also let apps put themselves in PiP mode “from the resumed or a pausing state where the system supports it.” Developers will be able to specify the aspect ratio and a set of custom buttons and interactions, and it could be one of Android O’s most useful features. There’s also a new overlay window for apps to use instead of the system alert window, as well as multi-display support for launching an activity on a remote screen. Google Android O’s icons are more than just static pictures. Android O’s icons have gotten a boost, too. Developers can now create adaptive icons that change dynamically, similar to the way the Calendar icon automatically changes with the date on the Pixel phones. According to Google, Android can now display icons in different shapes, based on a mask selected by the device, and the system will also animate custom interactions with the icons all across the system. Developers will also be getting new Autofill APIs in Android O, which will make using password managers much easier. Where users previously had to jump back and forth between apps to fill in stored passwords, Android O will let developers build platform support for autofill, just like Smart Lock does in Chrome. Users will be able to select autofill apps similar to the how they switch between keyboards, with secure access to data such as addresses, user names, and passwords. O, that’s not all! There are many more changes under the hood in Android O as well. Fonts will now be a fully supported resource type, so apps will be able to display richer custom fonts. Developers will be able to use fonts in XML layouts as well as define font families, as well as declare the font style and weight along with the font files. Elsewhere, developers will have access to a wide-gamut color for supported displays, high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs, new Wi-Fi and telecommunication features, “a more reliable, predictable model for ‘arrow’ and ‘tab’ navigation,” and a native AAudio API for high-performance, low-latency audio. And Android O will support several new Java Language APIs, including the new java.time API. Finally, Google worked closely with hardware manufacturers and chip partners to target specific issues they had with Nougat, whether in the form of fixes or enhancements. Google specifically calls out Sony, which has contributed “more than 30 feature enhancements and 250 bug fixes” to the next version of Android. Perhaps this signals a way for Google to ensure future Android updates gets into the hands of all users, but either way, it’s great to see Google and OEMs working closer together. The developer preview of Android O is not part of the over-the-air beta program, so developers will need manually download the factory image and flash the ROM to their devices. Google is also promising to open it up to the main beta program as development continues, and will be doing “a deep dive on all things Android” at I/O in May.

Judge Says Google Must Do More To Disclose That It Intercepts, Scans Emails From Non-Gmail Users Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Judge Says Google Must Do More To Disclose That It Intercepts, Scans Emails From Non-Gmail Users March 21, 2017 12:44 pm EDT By Chris Morran@themorrancave do better gmail google lawsuits privacy Google recently tried to settle a class-action lawsuit with non-Gmail users who sued because their emails to Gmail users were being intercepted and scanned for the purposes of providing targeted advertising to the recipient. However, that settlement has been rejected by the judge in the case, who says it doesn’t go far enough in requiring proper disclosures from Google about this invasive practice. This particular lawsuit [PDF] was filed in 2015 by a San Francisco man who alleged that Google violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act by “intercepting, reading, and analyzing the content of private email messages” without permission. The plaintiff is not a Gmail user and says he has no other Google accounts, so he contends there is no way he could have given Google permission to access the content of the emails he sends to people with Gmail accounts. After Google’s motion to dismiss the case was largely denied [PDF] by the court in Sept. 2016, a settlement deal was reached. That proposed settlement [PDF] includes a technical change to the point at which Google can scan a Gmail user’s email. Rather than intercept and analyze these messages in transit, Google says it will wait “until a Gmail user can retrieve the email in his or her mailbox.” It’s a minor point, but one that the lawyers contend will put the practice in compliance with California and federal laws. Since the message is no longer being “intercepted,” they maintain that no statutes are being violated, as Gmail users have given their consent to this sort of scanning. Since Google is not discontinuing the practice of scanning and analyzing emails — even from outside email providers — the deal also includes a plan to notify consumers about this practice. It’s this disclosure that the judge found lacking. “The notice does not clearly disclose that Google intercepts, scans, and analyzes the content of emails sent by non-Gmail users to Gmail users for the purpose of creating user profiles of the Gmail users to create targeted advertising for the Gmail user,” explains Judge Lucy Koh in her rejection [PDF] of the proposed settlement. “It does not disclose that Google will scan the email of non-Gmail users while the emails are in transit for the ‘dual purpose’ of creating user profiles and targeted advertising and for detecting spam and malware.” Judge Koh also points out that, while the lawyers for both sides might agree that Google’s tweaks to its email-scanning practice now comply with federal and California statutes, the lawyers don’t actually back that assertion up with any argument or legal precedent. The judge similarly takes issue with the lawyers’ contention that this settlement should be approved because it’s similar to deals reach in other cases involving intrusive email scanning. “Every case and every settlement are different,” counters Koh, noting that one deal cited as precedent — a previous case involving Yahoo’s screening of users’ emails — included disclosures that were more robust than what Google has proposed. What’s more, explains Koh, the previous similar settlements cited by the lawyers only came about after going through the discovery process, allowing for a more thorough assessment of possible risk to consumers. Comparatively, no one has been deposed in this Gmail lawsuit and all documents cited in the dispute were turned up in previous litigation. Judge Koh says it is “particularly questionable” for the plaintiffs to reach a settlement deal using discovery material that is anywhere from three to six years old, especially since Google has only pledged to maintain the agreed-upon technical change for another three years. It’s now up to the parties in the lawsuit to hash out a new settlement that will meet the court’s standards.

Ron Amadeo - Mar 21, 2017 5:00 pm UTC Enlarge / The new Android O logo. Google reader comments 119 Share this story Almost exactly a year after the Android N Developer Preview launched, Google is unleashing a developer preview of the next major version of Android, "Android O." We haven't tried it yet (images should be dropping any minute now), and the heavy developer documentation is still on lockdown, but we do have a big list of new features to go over. Further ReadingAndroid 7.0 Nougat review—Do more on your gigantic smartphoneThis first developer preview is apparently not going to be super stable. Google's blog post notes that "it's early days, there are more features coming, and there's still plenty of stabilization and performance work ahead of us. But it's booting :)." Because of the early status, this first version of Android O won't be rolling out to the Android Beta program, which offers handy in-place OTA upgrades. Instead Google will be kicking it old school with images for the Nexus 5X, 6P, Player, and the Pixel, Pixel XL, and Pixel C. There's a Wear 2.0 version of Android O, but it's only available via the emulator. There's also a new version of the SDK, Android Studio 2.4, for developers interested in trying out the new APIs. Also remember there are two main parts to Android: the open source "AOSP" part and the closed-source "Google" part. Today we're only hearing about the open source parts, in contrast to day one of the Android N Developer Preview, where we only heard about AOSP features like split screen, redesigned notifications, and improved power savings. When it grew into the fully realized version of Nougat on the Google Pixel, we got headlining "Google" features like the Google Assistant. As usual Google says, "Over the course of the next several months, we'll be releasing updated developer previews, and we'll be doing a deep dive on all things Android at Google I/O in May." Now let's dive into some features! Background processing lockdown Implicit broadcasts wake up a ton of apps at once, which slows down your phone. The proposed "vision" at I/O: shut down implicit broadcasts and make every app use the Job Scheduler. Background services won't run unless you use the Job Scheduler, but foreground services (things that spawn an ongoing notification) will still be fine. At I/O the roadmap said this would kick in for a "future release." It seems that future release is Android O. Google's blog post says Android O "puts a big priority on improving a user's battery life and the device's interactive performance." Google plans to do this by adding "automatic limits" to what apps can do in the background in "three main areas: implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates." "Implicit broadcasts" are device-wide announcements that any app can listen to. In older versions of Android, these were things like a "connectivity change" from LTE to Wi-Fi or a "new picture" alert. Any app can sign up to receive these broadcasts and could wake up the second they happened, which is not a great idea for performance. For instance, when you take a new picture, Google Photos immediately starts up in the background and uploads the picture, and so can Dropbox. A picture editing app can also start up and add it to its photo index. Take a second picture, and all these apps are filling up your RAM and slowing down the phone. We don't have the documentation yet, but Google warned app developers at I/O 2016 that a background-processing lockdown was coming. Google identified apps' aggressive use of implicit broadcasts as a big reason for battery drain and sluggish performance, and it even shut down the "connection change" and "new picture" alerts in Android 7.0 Nougat. The recommended replacement for these background jobs was "Job Scheduler," an API introduced in Android 5.0 Lollipop. Job Scheduler is a "lazier" way to do background processing. Apps sign up for a background job, which would happen at some point in the future. Job Scheduler batches up background processing requests into one big slice of "background processing time," which preferably happens when the phone is idle, or better yet, plugged in. Job Scheduler is like a traffic cop for background processing, resulting in a phone that wakes up less, sleeps more, and saves more battery. During its background processing talk at I/O, Google showed off a "vision" for how background processing would work in a "future release" of Android. All implicit broadcasts were shut off, and apps would have to totally rely on Job Scheduler. Doing this to everything would break a lot of apps, so the proposed change would happen only for apps that "target" the new release. "Targeting" a release of Android means an app is aware of Android features up to that release and would be signing up for the new APIs and background restrictions. We'll have to dive into the documentation once it goes up, but it seems like that "future release" Google talked about at I/O is Android O. Adaptive icons Pixel devices use circular icons, Samsung devices use a squircle, and numerous Chinese companies try to emulate Apple's rounded rectangle icons, so what's a third-party app developer to do? The new "Adaptive icons" feature will let developers pick a background image, which each individual Android skin can then cut out to fit the system design. The idea is to have your unique icon in the center of a variable shape, with a background image that can be cut several different ways. This new type of icon will work pretty much everywhere you see an icon—on the launcher, shortcuts, settings sharing dialogs, and the overview screen—and system animation will be correctly applied to the variable shape. Picture-in-picture on phones and tablets One of the goals in Android 7.0 Nougat was to standardize a lot of the windowing shenanigans OEMs had been pulling off in their Android skins. The development of a resizable app framework led to split-screen mode on phones and tablets, picture-in-picture mode on TVs, and a multiwindow mode that hasn't been used on any Google device but is there for OEMs like Samsung that want to implement it. Multiwindow mode and split screen are not necessarily enough for phones and tablets, though. A lot of OEMs and app developers try to implement a phone picture-in-picture mode or a floating video window with all sorts of hacks. Now in Android O, picture-in-picture on phones is something that will be officially supported. Apps will be able to spawn a floating video feed with custom commands like "Play" and "Pause." It would be great if this worked for YouTube, and hopefully Google won't make it part of the "YouTube Red" subscription service. Better keyboard navigation Enlarge Ron Amadeo If the Pixel C is to be believed, the future of Android tablets involves being productivity-focused keyboard machines. The problem is Android has pretty terrible hardware keyboard support, and Google plans to make that a bit better in Android O. Google says it is "focused on building a more reliable, predictable model for "arrow" and "tab" navigation." Better tabbing will be a welcome improvement, but the Pixel C with Android 7.0 still has a ton of keyboarding issues beyond just navigation. Android is designed around a software keyboard, and when you take that away and replace it with a hardware one, a lot of issues pop up. You would expect to be able to open up an app and start typing on your hardware keyboard, but no app really does "default typing focus" correctly, because that would make a software keyboard pop up on most devices. So you always have to do an extra tap on the input box you want. Maybe now you'll be able to tab over to a box, but that's still clunkier than a real keyboard-and-mouse OS like Windows, MacOS, or Linux. The software keyboard also has auto correct, and many apps (like Gmail) rely on it for spell check. Use a hardware keyboard and suddenly a lot of apps have no spell check at all. Better wireless audio Sony says LDAC has 3x the bandwidth of regular Bluetooth audio. Sony I hope phones never get rid of the headphone jack. But if they do, (or even if they don't) it would be nice to have something better than the crusty old Bluetooth A2DP protocol wireless headphones are stuck with today. To help with this, Android O is packing support for some higher-quality wireless audio options. Sony has donated its proprietary LDAC codec—a higher-bandwidth, higher-quality alternative to regular Bluetooth—to AOSP, allowing any OEM to implement LDAC on a device for free. Building a set of compatible headphones will most likely still require paying a licensing fee to Sony, but the consumer electronics giant is probably hoping that becomes a more appealing idea to headphone manufacturers once every new Android phone has LDAC onboard. Right now you will only find LDAC headphones from Sony. Sony actually got a special shout out from Google in the blog post: "Sony Mobile has contributed more than 30 feature enhancements and 250 bug fixes to Android O." This isn't the first time Sony has dropped big chunks of code into AOSP; the company is also responsible for Android's resource-overlay framework, which powers most of the OEM theme stores you see out there. There's also a plug-in architecture in Android O for "high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs," so if an OEM prefers something like Qualcomm's AptX (another proprietary higher-bandwidth/higher-quality audio standard) they can pay a licensing fee and more easily drop it into Android. Tons of other features Android O's list of features goes on and on. Autofill APIs will allow users to select a designated autofill app, "similar to the way they select a keyboard app." This should make password managers work a lot better, without the need for janky copy/paste solutions or hacks to the keyboard framework. Notification channels are "app-defined categories for notification content." This will be a way for apps to provide a bunch of notification "channels" that the user can manage. Most developers build this from scratch today. Gmail lets you pick what labels you want notifications from, and a Twitter app lets you decide if you want notifications for retweets, likes, and/or new posts. This will be a more platform-standard way to provide different notification types, putting the "channels" in the regular OS notification settings, rather than buried somewhere in the app. Wide-gamut color support for apps will allow imaging apps on devices with wide-gamut color displays to open wide-gamut images with the right color profile. This isn't HDR, which offers more (and less) brightness, but wide-color, which offers more colors. Font resources in XML will make fonts a "fully supported resource type" in Android O, allowing developers to add a custom font to an app just as easily as they add images or text. With great power comes great responsibility, developers. Please don't use crazy fonts! AAudio API for Pro Audio is yet another swing at low-latency audio on Android. Google says that this new API is "specifically for apps that require high-performance, low-latency audio," and today it's releasing an "early version" to get feedback from developers. Low audio latency is crucial for music-creation apps—you can't play a virtual piano if every key touch has a delay—but there is no silver bullet. Audio latency is something created by the entire stack, the SoC, display, drivers, and OS. So even if Google gets everything right, it will only work on devices specifically designed to minimize latency. WebView multiprocessing is now on by default. WebView is basically an embeddable browser window for apps, and in Android N it became part of the Chrome APK and switched to a "beta" multithreaded version. Now it's the default. Developers will get WebView crash handling in Android O, too. ART Optimizations: Google says the Android Runtime (ART) is "faster than ever before, with improvements of up to 2x on some application benchmarks." ART is the engine that powers Java apps on Android, so an improvement to ART can automatically make nearly every app better. Google is also promising new Java APIs, like Java.time. That's about it for Google's blog post, but this is just part one of our look at Android O. With the documentation and software coming out right now, we'll have a ton more content in the next day or so.

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images The controversy over ads appearing next to extremist content on YouTube has been a largely British affair - but now it's making waves at Google's Mountain View HQ. A new blog by Google's Chief Business Officer promises more safeguards for advertisers. But I've seen for myself just how hard it seems to be for Google to police its platform. Philipp Schindler, who runs the Google advertising business, the profit engine fuelling the entire search empire, repeats the apology to advertisers made yesterday by his colleague Matt Brittin. He says he knows that what has happened is "unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us", and he says a change in policies has already begun. Starting today, he writes, Google is taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. This includes removing ads from videos containing that sort of material but also taking what he calls a "hard look" at what sort of content should be allowed on YouTube at all. 'More control' Mr Schindler also details a number of ways that advertisers will be given more control and transparency over where their ads are placed and promises that Google will be "hiring significant numbers of people and developing new tools powered by our latest advancements in AI and machine learning to increase our capacity to review questionable content for advertising". What isn't clear is whether any of those people will be actively setting out to find this questionable content - yesterday Matt Brittin ducked questions about that at the Advertising Week conference. My experience looking for extremist videos on YouTube this morning shows it isn't too difficult to find them. I discovered a video of a speech given by National Action, a right-wing extremist group banned by the Home Secretary under anti-terrorism legislation late last year. The video had been posted three months ago, but shortly after I'd tweeted about its presence on the site it was removed - you will now find a message saying "This content is not available on this country domain." Image copyright Youtube Image caption Advertising appearing on an anti-Semitic video. A little later I returned to the YouTube channel of the person who'd uploaded the National Action video. Most seemed to be about Hitler, Nazism and its supporters, and while none of these videos looked to be illegal, I can't see advertisers wanting to be associated with them. One video starts with an interview with Milo Yiannopoulos about the prevalence of Jews in banking and the media and then moves to a Hitler speech overlaid with archive and captions of a clearly anti-Semitic nature. But what caught my eye was an advert on the video page - for the Advertising Week Europe conference. So, irony of ironies - the event where Google promised to deal with the issue of brands' ads appearing on content not "aligned with their values" is being advertised next to a video promoting a hateful anti-Semitic message. It looks as though Philipp Schindler and his team have quite a job on their hands if they are to win back the trust of advertisers.

SMX West keynote: Google talks about ranking, more in Google Assistant Google's Jason Douglas shares what marketers and developers need to know about Actions on Google. Matt McGee on March 21, 2017 at 11:39 am More Good morning from day one of SMX West 2017! We’re in San Jose, Calif., where the opening keynote conversation is set to begin at 9 a.m. PT. Jason Douglas, PM Director for Actions on Google, will be talking about Google Assistant with Search Engine Land’s Chris Sherman and Greg Sterling. Douglas will be talking about the developer ecosystem that’s growing around Google Assistant, and specifically about “Actions” — Google’s term for tools and features that let brands, marketers, developers and others interact with users through Google Assistant. Think of Actions kinda like apps for a smartphone or tablet. The keynote conversation is set to begin at the top of the hour, and we’ll be live-blogging right here once it gets started. So come back then, or just stay tuned, and feel free to refresh the page for the latest from SMX West! Okay, we’re set to go. I’ll be using JD for Jason Douglas, CS for Chris Sherman and GS for Greg Sterling. (Cross your fingers that I can keep up with three people talking on stage!) I’ll also try to sprinkle in some tweets along the way. Jason is going to start with a brief presentation before the conversation begins. He reminds the audience about Google’s mission to organize the world’s information. He says Google thinks we’re at an inflection point now in how information is accessed. Douglas talks about how Google was born in the era of organizing web content, accessible via a simple text box — users could type what they were looking for and get blue links to web pages and documents. Technology doesn’t stand still, he says — computing has changed. We have computers in our pockets, and we use them for doing more than looking for information. We order movie tickets and food. Our cars and TVs are computers. Computers are everywhere. The cost is complexity. Should I have to install a new app just to change my light bulb? That doesn’t make sense. We need a tool to tame this. Enter the Google Assistant. It’s a conversational experience between you and Google to help you get things done in your world. Whatever you need help with, you should be able to ask the Assistant. You should be able to use natural language. We believe that conversation is the simplest and most universal way of getting things done. But it’s not just about understanding words. It’s about context. The Assistant should know something about you to understand you — your situation, your location, your need, so it can understand you as efficiently as possible. This is exciting because it feels like it’s the right time for this — the technology is just now making this possible. Speech recognition and machine learning are important developments. Maps, the Knowledge Graph, structured data — all these are helpful in understanding how to get things done. Assistant: Context and Memory is important. "when is my next appointment", "how long will it take to bike there", "which route", etc. #smx — Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) March 21, 2017 Assistant began on Google Allo, then Google Home and Pixel — it’s in cars, too. Anywhere people need help, Google Assistant should be there. This is why we think it’s important to invest in a robust developer platform. That’s where Actions on Google comes in. This is what I work on. We think this can be the next big ecosystem in the tradition of Search and Google Play. Jason Douglas of @Google: "The platform for Google Assistant may become the next big ecosystem for Google, like YouTube, GPlay, etc." #SMX — QuanticMind (@TheQuanticMind) March 21, 2017 Three focuses for Actions on Google: Connect with users wherever the Google Assistant is available. Help users get things done with your service. Innovate with the conversational interface. 1. Connect with users. We’ve launched a simple directory for users to discover services and marketers to promote their service. Actions can also be found by name and by intent. 2. Help users get things done. We should understand their intent. If a user asks for a recipe, we can bring in the right Action to help. Identity and payments — making them as easy and natural as possible. Google Actions can assist a customer through the whole life cycle of a transaction #smx pic.twitter.com/5ygYpPo8Ft — Mark Traphagen (@marktraphagen) March 21, 2017 3. Innovation — conversation is very different from other mediums. We’re trying to share the best practices that we’ve learned about using conversation as a medium. And with that, the presentation is over and Chris Sherman and Greg Sterling are taking the stage. CS: What would you do to encourage this audience to think about and take advantage of Actions? JD: I’d start with the developer site. Think about the design. GS: I was interested to hear you say that third-party services aren’t things that need to be installed. Mentions how you have to install apps on Amazon Echo. JD: Yes, anything that’s been registered with the platform is available to users. Mentions the Personal Chef example from his conversation. GS: In mobile, there’s the challenge of app discovery. App stores, social media, search. What do you envision for Google Home — for Actions, how do envision discovery in the future? JD: Actions will eventually be available across devices and platforms, not just on Home. So that’s more potential distribution. Voice is best for discovery, but there are challenges — presenting lots of choices is difficult on voice. In terms of being discovered, the most important thing will be to provide something useful for users. We are providing some hooks to be able to market a service. GS: Is there an Actions directory? JD: It’s buried inside the app, but we’ll make it more prominent over time. GS: asks question about search and Assistant. JD: I think of them as somewhat different. Search is part of what Assistant is about, but it’s also about cooking timers and knowing your calendar and stuff that’s personal to you, things you want to get done. We do see a user journey where search can lead into something transactional and helpful, like asking about a movie and then buying a ticket to see it. Jason Douglas says it's "Important to think about what a brand's Persona should be and how to talk to it" #smx #GoogleAssistant — Tracy Pfiffner (@TracyPfiffner) March 21, 2017 Search is about helping you find anything out in the world. The assistant is more about your own world & helping you within it. #Google #SMX — Search Engine Land (@sengineland) March 21, 2017 CS: How do you deal with services and choosing which one to surface for a user? Is a search index even the way to think about things anymore? JD: It’s very different from how a web document is ranked. Ultimately, I think it’s going to be about what is the easiest way to help the user get things done — we’re still figuring that out. What is involved in the ranking on #GoogleAssistant ranking? #smx #keynote it seems @Google is still figuring them out — Farzin Espahani (@FarzinOja) March 21, 2017 CS: You mentioned identity in your talk, which raises the obvious question about privacy. JD: We take privacy extremely seriously. A product like the Assistant isn’t going to work without trust. When it comes to sharing information, there’s always consent. We want to give users control over all of this. GS: What does Google’s research reveal about user preference for how they receive information via voice? JD: There’s been an emphasis, especially on mobile, on moving toward providing answers. That succinct summary is often the best thing for users. (missed question) GS: Will I able to tell Assistant what my preferred services are — I prefer TripAdvisor for travel queries, for example. JD: That’s one way. We’re trying to decide now how sticky those preferences should be. In some cases, you can set some preferences in the app. We’re trying to learn as we go. For shopping, is it convenience or best price that matters most. There are a lot of new ranking and quality challenges. @jdouglas: a great deal of complexity in providing voice search answers. Is it location, relevance, price? Still finding synthesis #SMX — Tony Verre (@TonyVerre) March 21, 2017 Some of these services are pretty high stakes. It can be money, or health, or home repair … it’s a big deal if you get a bad result. We’re exploring how to manage quality there so users can continue to trust Assistant. Audience questions… Q: How do you envision ads being incorporated into the Assistant ecosystem? JD: It’s early on. We’re trying to learn what the best opportunities and user experience is. It won’t be successful as a developer platform if developers can’t be successful as businesses. We’re still trying to figure this out. Ads in Google Assistant: Early on& figuring things out. Focused on user experience, some of that will indicate opportunities @jdouglas #smx — Jennifer Slegg (@jenstar) March 21, 2017 Q: How does Assistant deal with slang? JD: I’m not the best person to answer this, but we’ve made a lot of big investments around language recognition and machine learning. Q: How do you see Assistant fitting into a B2B landscape? JD: I think Google has a history of starting with the consumer side and bringing it to B2B later. There was a demo at the Cloud conference recently showing some possibilities. I’m focused on the consumer side. Q: How do you decide between proximity and quality on what to recommend? JD: I think the signals are different between a web search and voice search. Ads I said earlier, we’re still working on figuring out the best signals for users. And with that, the keynote conversation is over! Thanks for tuning in.

With its nearly two billion monthly users, the social network could make a big dent in traditional TV and help usher in a major shift towards social TV, Wharton experts say. The social network’s latest video push is partly due to a need to find more ad spaces. In its latest earnings call, Facebook says growth in the second half of 2017 will slow due to a peaking ad load, or how many ads are served up to users. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is also tipping his hat to a fast-growing trend: Digital video viewing is exploding. According to Cisco Systems, video accounted for 60% of mobile data traffic in 2016 and should rise to 78% by 2021. The Interactive Advertising Bureau says ad spending on U.S. mobile video rose 178% in the first half of 2016 from a year ago, comprising more than 40% of the $3.9 billion total online video market. “Social media is moving from text to pictures to video, so Facebook is following its consumers,” says Wharton marketing professor Jonah Berger. Facebook’s video efforts include the recent launch of Facebook Live, which is a live-stream service similar to Twitter’s Periscope. The social network also created an app for Apple TV and other set-top boxes so people can watch its videos on a TV screen. It debuted 360-degree videos and reportedly is planning to add episodic shows from Hollywood — or produce its own original content — up to 30 minutes long. The company has hired Ricky Van Veen, co-founder of video site CollegeHumor, as creative chief, and also MTV executive Mina Lefevre to develop original TV shows. “Although Facebook has not historically been a media company, it makes sense that they want to [prevent] their massive user base from moving to other online sites that have scripted show offerings. Therefore, they are capitalizing on a very ‘hot’ area right now — online scripted shows,” says Shawndra Hill, senior fellow at the Wharton Customer Analytics Initiative. “The democratization of content, production and consumption has already begun.”–Shawndra Hill “It could possibly be a perfect marriage between a large, engaged user base, new and exciting content, and perhaps most importantly, an already healthy advertising ecosystem that users are very familiar with,” Hill adds. “Even more interestingly, Facebook has a way to reach millennials, a group of viewers that companies find hard to reach by traditional advertising.” Wharton marketing professor Pinar Yildirim further points out that the lines are already blurring between social networks and media companies. “Both are ultimately about content creation — whether by users or professionals — and consumption,” she says. Folks now are using social media and watching TV concurrently. “Combining the two, or allowing individuals to also interact over networks while consuming content, is eliminating one friction.” Indeed, “the world is moving in the direction of consuming more media content online. As people spend an increasing proportion of their day using online services for scripted content, it will be even more difficult to grasp consumer attention via linear TV,” Hill says. “Attention will be fragmented by online services.” Sponsored Content: But social TV needs good content to thrive. To encourage creators, Facebook took a page from YouTube and agreed to share ad revenues. It will keep 45% of the pot, according to The Wall Street Journal. However, in a departure from industry practice, Facebook has banned pre-rolls, or ads that play in front of the content, in favor of those that play in the middle of the video for a better user experience. Facebook also is paying some celebrities and media firms to create Live videos. “Videos are a good way to elicit engagement. For example, they draw more comments than photos,” says Kartik Hosanagar, Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions who has written a research paper on Facebook. However, “one challenge for Facebook has been that its users have slowed down in terms of the amount of content and updates they now post on the social network. Also, Facebook has been looking for ways to diversify its business. In light of these two observations, the decision to go into video starts to make sense.” The Race for Ad Dollars Facebook and Google already attract the most online advertising dollars. With the video push, Facebook and Google’s YouTube “may replicate their mobile advertising dominance,” according to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence. To be sure, there are plenty of other video contenders. “Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Yahoo and Twitter all aim to compete for new video ad dollars,” the report said. Also in the running are Hulu and Amazon. Thus far, Netflix is avoiding commercials. “People just want to see what their high school buddies are doing — and making it a standalone entertainment service might not work.”–Peter Fader “All of these services will aim to crowd out one another. For the consumer, however, it will be great to have fresh new content that is both similar to traditional TV via existing TV network partnerships, and innovative [services] by introducing solutions like virtual reality, where viewers themselves can be ‘part’ of shows,” Hill says. “I foresee a lot of innovation and evolution in this space before we can say for sure what is most interesting to viewers. In any case, the barriers are low right now for people to switch around and watch all solutions (from Hulu to YouTube to Facebook). However, this might not always be the case, as content providers think through pricing for their solutions.” YouTube is making changes to be more competitive. It will do away with 30-second ads that cannot be skipped starting in 2018 in favor of other unskippable formats, like six- and 20-second ads. Netflix is looking into creating versions of its content that look better on small screens. Facebook has launched an ad campaign — reportedly the biggest in its history — encouraging marketers to create video clips that would display well on smartphones. “The key is to design the content to fit the medium,” Berger says. “Understand how consumers are using these mediums and what they are looking for, and build content that matches” the format. Adds Katherine Milkman, Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions: “My research suggests that if the goal is to create viral content, then making sure the content elicits an emotional response is key. The types of emotions that make your heart race … are more useful for creating a viral response than emotions that dampen excitement, [such as] sadness. Making it useful, surprising and interesting is also important.” Hill points out that these ads are useful to Facebook advertisers because they “open the door to do more precise one-to-one marketing. From an advertiser’s perspective, the most exciting aspect of these services is that viewers can be reached both inside their living room and just about anywhere else — on the subway or a plane, for instance,” Hill says. “In addition, these services will know exactly who is watching and for how long, since viewership will be linked to an individual-level user ID.” “Will it be successful? It’s anyone’s guess. Consumers have enough options for video today.”–Kartik Hosanagar Hill adds that since people are already online, “advertisers can provide calls to action that land viewers on the relevant web pages to get information or make a purchase — or even better, the calls to action can be voice-activated to simply say ‘purchase’ in the future to reduce the likelihood that people turn away from shows. Once online media solutions have reached the point where they are replacing linear TV in significant numbers, TV and ad measurement the way we know it now will be dead.” Facebook Premium? Wharton marketing professor Peter Fader says Facebook ought to consider a premium service that includes videos and other content and services accessible only to paying members. “Look at Amazon Prime and how they leveraged it in so many different directions” including bundling digital video, two-day shipping, e-book rentals and other perks, he points out. “Who can deny the success of that? [Facebook needs] to be looking in that direction.” It should learn from the missteps of struggling YouTube Red, the video site’s premium service that is free of ads, carries original content developed by YouTube and allows offline playback. “It’s just not clear to me how different the [subscriber] experience is,” Fader says. “With Amazon, it had free shipping, etc. Maybe [YouTube Red’s proposition] just wasn’t enough.” YouTube Red costs $10 a month or $120 a year, higher than Amazon Prime’s $99 yearly cost. But will people want to watch TV on Facebook? Perhaps “people just want to see what their high school buddies are doing — and making it a standalone entertainment service might not work,” Fader says. “But on the other hand, it now has such a share of mind [and] it is such a huge platform that it makes sense for the advertiser to go there.” He points out that Facebook has already evolved during its 10-year history and it could become a multifaceted platform one day. One thing is clear: There is a definite shift away from traditional TV. “I think we’ll move away from thinking of scripted shows as TV,” Hill says. It will all just be content. “We will soon enter a world where we call content connected media and it will be watched over the internet. The democratization of content, production and consumption has already begun. There will continue to be many players in this space initially, but we will eventually converge to a few large players, I think.” Will Facebook be one of those remaining players in video? “Will it be successful? It is anyone’s guess. Consumers have enough options for video today. For social video, there is YouTube. For premium content, we have Hulu and Netflix,” Hosanagar says. “So it’s unclear what niche Facebook can occupy in that market. Unless Facebook identifies a clear niche … it’s not clear it will have mass market success.” Supports K@W's Technology Content Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "How Facebook’s Big Bet on Video Could Change TV."

The preview includes an updated SDK with system images for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, and the official Android Emulator, and there’s even an emulator for testing Android Wear 2.0 on Android O. In the past, Google has unveiled the next Android version and released the accompanying developer preview at its I/O developer conference. That changed last year with the release of the first Android N developer preview in March 2016, along with the Android Beta Program, which lets you get early Android builds via over-their-air updates on Nexus devices. This year, Android O is getting previewed early like Nougat was, but the first preview isn’t being made available via Android Beta. Google is making this preview available solely by manual download and flash to emphasize it is for developers only and not intended for daily or consumer use. Other than that, the same rules apply. This is an early look at the next version of Android, which is being referred to as Android O until Google picks a name starting with that letter. The goal is to let developers play with the build early, test their apps, and give their feedback before more details are shared at I/O 2017, scheduled for May 17 to May 19. Today’s preview includes the following APIs and features (but you can expect much more; this is just the first preview, after all): Background limits: Building on Nougat’s battery life improvements, Android O has additional automatic limits on what apps can do in the background (implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates). These changes will make it easier to create apps that have minimal impact on a user’s device and battery. Notification channels: New app-defined categories for notification content that let developers give users fine-grained control over different kinds of notifications — users can block or change the behavior of each channel individually (pictured above), rather than managing all the app’s notifications together. There are also new notification visuals and groupings. Autofill APIs: Users can select an autofill app like how they select a keyboard app. The autofill app stores and secures user data, such as addresses, user names, and even passwords. Picture in Picture (PIP): Users can continue watching a video while they’re answering a chat or hailing a car. Apps can put themselves in this mode from the resumed or a pausing state where the system supports it; developers can specify the aspect ratio and a set of custom interactions (such as play/pause). Other new windowing features include a new app overlay window for apps to use instead of system alert window, and multi-display support for launching an activity on a remote display. Font resources in XML: Fonts are now a fully supported resource type. Apps can use fonts in XML layouts as well as define font families in XML by declaring the font style and weight along with the font files. Adaptive icons: Developers can now create adaptive icons that the system displays in different shapes, based on a mask selected by the device. The system also animates interactions with the icons and shows them in the launcher, shortcuts, Settings, sharing dialogs, and in the overview screen. Wide-gamut color for apps: Imaging app developers can take advantage of devices that have a wide-gamut color capable display. To display wide gamut images, apps will need to enable a flag in their manifest (per activity) and load bitmaps with an embedded wide color profile (AdobeRGB, Pro Photo RGB, DCI-P3, etc.). Connectivity: High-quality Bluetooth audio codecs are now supported, and Sony has made their LDAC codec available. New Wi-Fi features like Neighborhood Aware Networking (NAN), based on the Wi-Fi Aware specification, are also included so that devices with the appropriate hardware, apps, and nearby devices can discover and communicate over Wi-Fi without an Internet access point. The Telecom framework introduces expanded support for calling apps to better interoperate with one another and with carrier-made calls. The ConnectionService APIs have been expanded to support calling apps which want to inform Telecom of their calls but do not want to rely on the system Phone app to display the call. Keyboard navigation: A more reliable and predictable model for “arrow” and “tab” navigation that aids both developers and end users. AAudio API for Pro Audio: A new native API designed specifically for apps that require high-performance, low-latency audio. Apps using AAudio read and write data via streams. WebView enhancements: The multiprocess mode introduced in Nougat has been enabled by default and there is now an API to let apps handle errors and crashes. Developers can opt in their app’s WebView objects to verify URLs through Google Safe Browsing. Java 8 APIs and runtime optimizations: Android now supports several new Java Language APIs, including the new java.time API. The Android Runtime is also faster than ever before, with improvements of up to 2x on some application benchmarks. Partner platform contributions: Hardware manufacturers and silicon partners have accelerated fixes and enhancements. In particular, Sony Mobile has contributed more than 30 feature enhancements and 250 bug fixes to Android O. Google is asking developers to make their app compatible with Android O so that their users can expect a seamless transition when they upgrade. Also worth checking out is the alpha release of the alpha version of the 26.0.0 support library. After you try the first preview, give feedback.

Can Samsung's Bixby Smash Alexa? By Sascha Segan March 20, 2017 09:00am EST 10 Comments Samsung bought the creators of Siri and wants to tie together your home electronics with voice. With Google and Amazon already far ahead, Samsung is racing the clock. SEOUL—In the battle of the virtual assistants, Amazon has friends and Google has search. Samsung has your TV and washing machine. Samsung's Bixby AI system, coming on the Galaxy S8 phone which launches on March 29, starts out as voice commands for your phone. But its end goal is to tie together all of your home electronics—Samsung or not—with natural-language voice interfaces. The question is whether Samsung can spin its plans up quickly enough to chase Amazon and Google, or whether Bixby will languish on phones as the next S Voice. We spoke with Samsung Mobile's CTO, Injong Rhee, at Samsung headquarters in Korea. Rhee, whose leonine curls make him look like a 1980's pop star on a reunion tour for screaming moms, has a big, long-term vision for Bixby, which is fully supported by Samsung mobile chief DJ Koh. Bixby isn't named after the TV actor best known for playing Bruce Banner in the Incredible Hulk. Samsung just came up with a bunch of names that sounded good, and "Bixby was the No. 1 choice among the millennials," Rhee said. Coincidentally, the Bixby Bridge by Big Sur is a California landmark, so the name "has the connotation of bridging machine and human." It also helps that the "X" in the middle of Bixby makes it easy for computers to understand the word, and that it jibes with another Samsung product, Knox. Bixby defaults to a female voice, and initially works in English and Korean; US Spanish will follow, then other languages. It may also have a male voice option, but that wasn't clear. Speak to Me, Bones Initially, Bixby is a voice interface for the built-in features on phones. It also does some computer-vision tricks, translating languages and identifying places in photos shot with your phone. But the full idea is an "intelligent user interface" to let you control all the features of home electronics. "Right now our focus is on device interface and application controls," Rhee said. For internet-based queries, the next Galaxy phone will presumably also have the Google Assistant, but there was some back-and-forth about whether Bixby would be able to hand off web queries to Google Assistant in the future. It sounds like Samsung's working on it. "It starts off with smartphones, but anywhere that has an internet connection and a microphone, Bixby can be used. It can be in any devices we produce: appliances, TVs, refrigerators, washing machines," Rhee said. Before you wonder about washing machines, think about the complicated dials are on today's machines. Then think about just standing in front of it and commanding it to "wash a large load of lights on hot and tell me five minutes before it's done." "I always go to my washing machine and say, 'Hmm, what do I do?' That's a limit of the interface," Rhee said. Samsung envisions Bixby as working across networks of devices, probably linked through Samsung's SmartThings Hub (above). LG is trying to make a similar vision happen with Amazon's Alexa and its own SmartThinq hub. That way, you can say, "'What's the email message I just received, and can you show it on my TV?' That capability might not be on the TV, but it may be in your smartphone, and you're doing it with the TV remote control," Rhee said. Press the Button In an era when we're getting nervous about always-listening devices, Samsung has a slightly retro solution: a button. By default, Bixby won't listen until you press the button. A Bixby button could be a fingerprint sensor on the front of a washing machine, verifying a user's identity and waking up the voice interface. Or it could be on a remote control, the way it is with Amazon's voice-activated Fire TV. "How can you make sure [the user] has control of the data? That's why the button is so important. We're not going to listen to the user unless the user does something with the hardware button," Rhee says. "Our plan is to have that button almost everywhere, including our appliances." Samsung's possible great leap forward here—if it works—is in applying true, natural language voice interfaces to local commands on electronics. Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and their ilk still think like computers, looking for specific trigger words and say "I don't understand you" if they can't parse a sentence. Bixby is supposed to react in a more human manner, Rhee said. "We know it's really cognitively challenging for people to understand exact commands," he said. So you could say, "show me a picture that I took in Paris. Turn that picture around. Share it with Michael," and Bixby would get as far as it can. If it can't figure out who Michael is, it'll show you a list of possible Michaels and transition to a more traditional touch-screen interface. "For a fairly convoluted or complicated task, a user has the freedom of speaking it in any manner and stopping in any place," he said. Samsung recently bought Viv Labs, an AI firm started by the creators of Siri, with natural language processing chops and an open third-party application platform. But the first version of Bixby won't integrate Viv's technology, Rhee said. Now we get to Samsung's greatest danger. Version 1.0 Troubles Bixby needs to take some inspiration from its non-namesake, because to battle Amazon's wonder woman, it's going to need to hulk out—fast. While Amazon's Alexa has many third party "Skills," and both Google Assistant and Siri have a seemingly endless array of knowledge cached from the internet, Bixby must be tied into specific applications and devices. And Bixby's initial feature set, while fine for a 1.0, is definitely a 1.0. While the full details haven't been released yet, I'm concerned that the first Galaxy S8 owners will feel it's too much like the long-unloved S Voice at start, and that assessment will stick in people's minds. Therein lies the danger. Viv's natural language technology? Coming. Third-party app support? It's coming. Support for internet-based search queries, or smoothly handing off to Google Assistant for search queries? Coming. Those promises are all well and good, but Samsung is starting in third or fourth place, and can't afford to delay differentiating features. Rhee wants Bixby to become a broad standard, on the back of Samsung's market dominance in phones. Samsung reps say that with the new leadership of Rhee and mobile CEO DJ Koh (who's been in the role for about a year), the company is supporting its services much better than it used to. Against the older story of Samsung's failed Milk Music service and struggling Gear third-party apps platform, they put Samsung's newer, successful Knox security system. Bixby is of the new era, they say. Related Alexa Lives in Your iPhone Now Alexa Lives in Your iPhone Now Samsung's position is inherently difficult. No Android manufacturer in a Google Play-supporting country (in other words, not China) has developed services that have really driven sales. It's telling that the four big voice interface companies—Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft—all control their own OS platforms. While that's true of Samsung's appliances, on phones it has to deal with the push-and-pull of being dependent on Google for its software. "There's a revolution in interface technologies, and the operating system becomes less relevant as time goes on," Rhee argued. That said, if Samsung opens this up big, and fast, it may have a chance. "I don't see it as so difficult to have it on other devices, even competitors. That's a future we have to think about, it's not completely out of the question," he said. "It personally makes sense to me."

A new feature on Google Maps allows users to record the location of their vehicle by tapping the blue location dot on the map screen and putting a "P" icon in its place to work as a signpost. For now, it's available only on Android phones, reports Mashable. While requiring manual input, the feature improves upon an old Google Now feature that used phone sensors to guess where you parked. As TechCrunch explains, Google Now couldn't always differentiate between the spot you parked your car and the stop where you got out of a taxi or bus. But Google isn't quite ahead of the curve here. This update comes a year after Apple Maps introduced its Parked Location feature, which automatically marks a car's location when an iPhone is disconnected from Bluetooth or CarPlay. Like Apple Maps, Google Maps allows users to add notes and photos, which help you to remember the level and row of your spot in a parking garage, for example. And while it logs only one parking location at a time—a potential issue if you park your car at an airport, then pick up a rental at your destination, per Android Police—Google users can also record time limits when they park in a metered space. The app displays the time remaining, then sends you an alert when it's about to run out.

Marks & Spencer , the BBC and the UK Government were among the organisations to suspend their advertising on Google-owned YouTube after it emerged ads had in some cases appeared on videos posted to the site by extremist groups. The technology giant apologised and insisted it would review its advertising policies and systems, which the firm's chief business officer Philipp Schindler has now said is already triggering changes.

"This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. "This change will enable us to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites. "We'll also tighten safeguards to ensure that ads show up only against legitimate creators in our YouTube Partner Program - as opposed to those who impersonate other channels or violate our community guidelines." The BBC was one of the organisations affected (Photo: PA) The internet giant was criticised by the Home Affairs Select Committee for not doing enough to combat the spread of hate-filled videos on the site, with committee chairwoman and Labour MP Yvette Cooper telling the firm it can afford to do "far more, far faster" to battle such content. Mr Schindler said Google would also make its advertising system "safer" for brands by giving them more control. "We're changing the default settings for ads so that they show on content that meets a higher level of brand safety and excludes potentially objectionable content that advertisers may prefer not to advertise against. "In addition, we'll introduce new controls to make it easier for brands to exclude higher risk content and fine-tune where they want their ads to appear."

"In cases where advertisers find their ads were served where they shouldn't have been, we plan to offer a new escalation path to make it easier for them to raise issues," he said. "In addition, we'll soon be able to resolve these cases in less than a few hours. "In the end, there's nothing more important to Google than the trust we've built amongst our users, advertisers, creators and publishers. "Brand safety is an ongoing commitment for us, and we'll continue to listen to your feedback."

In the coming months, owners of the Google Home smart speaker will be able to ask Google Assistant — the AI system embedded in Google's devices — to find the closest store with a particular item in stock. Example: "'OK Google, where can I find a brown pair of men's Top-Siders, size 11, nearby?'" said Jonathan Alferness, vice president of product at Google. "The Assistant will answer with how many stores have the item and how far away they are," he said. Participating retailers include Saks Fifth Avenue, Bed Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, PetSmart and Sephora. The new feature is powered by local inventory feeds sent by retailers that buy ads on Google, he said. In the past year, local shopping queries have increased 45 percent and the search giant has doubled the number of retailers that send local inventory feeds, said Alferness. Google announced the new features at the Shoptalk e-commerce conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday afternoon. Alphabet's Google is battling it out with Amazon to deliver goods and services to consumers at home. Google was late to the market with its smart speaker, which it started selling in the U.S. in November 2016, more than a year after Amazon's Echo became widely available in the U.S. The Echo could be a "mega-hit" and deliver $10 billion in revenue by 2020, according to RBC Capital Markets. But with this new feature, Google is offering users something the e-commerce giant doesn't — a way to find merchandise at your local store and try before you buy. Google also announced that it will soon let consumers tell its Assistant to create a shopping list and place items in a virtual cart that will sync across multiple devices. "This cart will give shoppers the ability to buy multiple items from multiple merchants all in one transaction through the Assistant," said Alferness. "For retailers, this means larger basket sizes and better margins." It's all part of Google's long-term strategy to develop products and services that use artificial intelligence to make it easier for people to interact with computers and complete everyday tasks, he said. That, in turn, will feed into Google's ad-based business model. "The better that we can satisfy users' needs, the better off we'll be," said Alferness. "The more you are going to want to use the Assistant, the more you will use our services as well."

It is used to protect against DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, where a website or online system is overwhelmed by traffic from multiple sources, with the aim of making the site inaccessible. Google’s 2 Step Verification and the Password Alert Chrome extension is also included. Password Alert warns users if they are entering their Google passwords in a non-Google page form, a common tactic used in Phishing attacks. “We try to be very transparent about what the criteria are for signing up for Shield,” Jigsaw’s Dan Keyserling told Wired. “We view DDoS attacks generally as sort of a bug in the internet — a tactic that shouldn’t be available to anybody.” “By making it easier for organizations to defend themselves against these threats, journalists can publish freely and citizens can access the stories, the debates, and the policies when it’s most important to a nation — during a country’s elections — so that everyone can get the full story,” Jigsaw said. Jigsaw’s president is Jared Cohen, a former State Department staffer who worked as an advisor to Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton.

Show More Well, it was bound to happen. Over the past several months, smartphone manufacturers have been hungering for a new hook -- a new way to make mobile devices seem fresh, exciting, and wallet-worthy at a point when last year's models still seem perfectly fine to most people. It's a cycle we've seen in AndroidLand plenty of times before. In the early days, each new iteration of a phone was faster than the last. More cores, more gigahertz -- more digits, damn it! Then came the display resolution phase. Higher resolution, more pixels, crisper, clearer, even more pixels! We saw a similar thing with camera quality for a while. Then the superlatives spread to thinness (seriously, how many times have we seen the "thinnest phone ever made"?) -- and lately, they've been zoning in on the non-problem of bezels and screen-to-body ratio. Like I said, there's always something. So it should probably come as no surprise, then, that the latest concept device-makers seem intent on driving into the ground is artificial intelligence. A.I. is rapidly becoming the consumer-tech buzzword du jour -- and already, it's basically been stripped of any real meaning. The reason? Everything imaginable is being branded as "artificial intelligence" right now -- but in actuality, most of the stuff falls somewhere between a repackaging of something old and a parroting of something better. That doesn't much matter, though -- because boy, oh boy, does it make for good marketing. The Android A.I. overload The latest high-profile example just landed on our virtual doorsteps: This week, Samsung revealed plans for Bixby, an A.I.-powered assistant it's planning to bake into its upcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone (and yes, "Bixby" is really what they're calling it). Per the company's press release: It will simplify user education with new voice interfaces and will make using your phone even more seamless and intuitive. Oh. Okay, then. If you'll allow me to do a little gobbledygook-to-English translation, what Samsung's trying to say is that Bixby will let you get around your phone by speaking. Within supported apps and processes (and that's a key point, because out of the box, Bixby will support only "a subset of preinstalled applications"), Bixby will let you complete "almost any task the application is capable of performing" by using your voice. Based on what Samsung's saying, it appears Bixby will be more focused on that sort of behavior -- acting as a voice command system for typically touch-oriented actions -- as opposed to trying to be a full-fledged "assistant" in the style of Siri or Google Assistant. Maybe I'm drastically underestimating how transformative such a system might be, but I can essentially see that covering two types of tasks: 1. Things you can already easily do with Google's own native voice command system You know, like this -- again, from Samsung's Bixby press release: For example, instead of taking multiple steps to make a call -- turning on and unlocking the phone, looking for the phone application, clicking on the contact bar to search for the person that you’re trying to call and pressing the phone icon to start dialing -- you will be able to do all these steps with one push of the Bixby button and a simple command. In other words, another way to say "OK Google, call Mom" -- except with the requirement of a physical button press before you speak. Classic Samsung. (Think S Voice, S Translator, the Samsung music players, Samsung app store, web browser, "hubs," and so on.) This sort of scenario does little more than create unnecessary redundancy and confusion, as we've discussed ad nauseam with these sorts of situations in the past. 2. Things for which the value of having a voice command is questionable Part of what's supposed to set Bixby apart is the fact that -- again, for the limited range of supported apps -- it'll let you perform practically any function you could accomplish via touch by using your voice instead. As Philip Berne, a Samsung marketing manager, explained it on Twitter: Bixby is not Alexa, or Siri. It's an interface. It's meant to [do] everything you could possibly do by touch, but with voice. My question there is: Why? There's the obvious accessibility angle -- and that's an area that's extremely valid and overdue for progress. (Google has been working on its own Voice Access hands-free system for similar purposes, but it's been in beta for almost a year and isn't the simplest interface to use.) That doesn't seem to be the angle Samsung's going for with this, though. And when you set aside that possibility and look at Bixby as a general consumer feature, I'm just not sure when using your voice to get around an app would be genuinely compelling in any broad sense. If you're walking or driving, you (hopefully) aren't looking at your screen and performing intricate actions. So fringe use-cases aside, when are you going to be looking at an app on your phone but finding it easier or more effective to speak an action aloud rather than simply tapping the command on the screen in front of you? Again, remember: Most actions where that would make obvious sense -- like controlling music playback or performing navigation-related tasks, for instance -- fall under our first category of things you can already do with Android's existing voice command system. (One possibility: The answer may actually be "rarely" to "never" but that Samsung hopes it can convince you to change your mind -- because Bixby could be a killer new way to get you to stay within the Samsung ecosystem of products. The company says it plans to put Bixby into all of its appliances eventually -- air conditioners, TVs, you name it -- and to evolve it "from a smartphone interface to an interface for your life." In other words, it wants Bixby to be a common thread that ties numerous Samsung products together and gives you a reason to stay committed to that family for a wide range of future purchases.) Buzz, buzz buzz, buzz buzz buzz buzz Ultimately, when hearing about "revolutionary" new forms of artificial intelligence for smartphones, we have to ask the same question I posed about specs in 2013: So what? Sure, your new phone's got this-or-that A.I.-powered something -- but so what? What does that actually mean for my life? What makes this phone, this system, this made-for-advertising feature valuable in real-world terms? I'm using Samsung as an example because it's the latest contender to throw its hat into the A.I.-everything ring, but it's far from the only player in the current buzzword-brandishing game. HTC has its own new A.I.-branded system of questionable value, and LG's been baking the same sort of overhyped crap into its devices for years now. Heck, even Google Assistant -- legitimately useful as it can be -- is mostly just a repackaging and expansion of a few long-familiar services. To be sure, there is some genuinely impressive and futuristic progress being made in the field of artificial intelligence. Having yet another overlapping way to tell your phone to turn off its Wi-Fi, however, isn't it -- no more so than having a display with "even more pixels" or a phone that was "20% thinner" meant anything of great significance in the past.

Name: Subject: Message: Add Facebook and Twitter authentication to your apps, using Firebase and Fabric Android Developmentby Jessica Thornsby2 days ago 277 7 User authentication can be a powerful addition to your Android app. Once you can identify the individual people who are using your app, you can customize your app’s content, potentially delivering an experience that feels as though it was designed with a specific user in mind. But authentication isn’t just a way of delivering a more compelling, highly-personalized user experience. Depending on the kind of app you’re creating, the ability to identify your users may be required for your app to function at all – good luck developing a chat, email or social media app if you have absolutely no way of telling who anyone is! Traditionally, authentication has required the user to complete a registration form, usually creating a username and password in the process. However, with the rise of social networks there’s now a much quicker and easier way of getting users signed into your app: using an account they’ve already created with an external authentication provider, such as Facebook or Twitter. In this tutorial, I’m going to show you how to replace the time-consuming and frustrating user registration form, with a simple ‘Sign in with Facebook’ or ‘Sign in with Twitter’ button, using Firebase Authentication and the Fabric platform. Introducing Firebase Authentication User authentication has the potential to greatly improve the user experience, but implementing this functionality has traditionally required you to setup your own servers and design a custom authentication system. This authentication system must be capable of verifying the user’s credentials and storing them securely, but it also needs to handle all the miscellaneous tasks that surround authentication, such as managing password reset requests. Even after you’ve got everything up and running, the hard work is far from over as your system and servers will require ongoing maintenance and updates if they’re going to continue running smoothly. To help you add authentication to your app without having to implement your own servers and systems, in this tutorial we’re going to be using Firebase Authentication, a backend-as-service (BaaS) platform that effectively provides servers and an authentication system out-of-the-box, leaving you free to focus on what really matters: providing a great experience once your users have signed in. The other major benefit of using Firebase Authentication, is that it’s designed to play nicely with other Firebase services, so once you’ve implemented Authentication you’ll be in an ideal position to use additional Firebase services. In particular, Firebase Cloud Storage can help you store and deliver user-generated content, and you can use Firebase Realtime Database Rules to control the information your authenticated users have access to, as well as the actions they can perform, for example if you’re developing an email app then you can use Database Rules to prevent users from reading emails that aren’t addressed to them. Why should I care about user authentication? Firebase Authentication may remove a lot of the complexity that’s traditionally surrounded user authentication, but adding authentication to your app is still a multi-step process. To help you decide whether giving users the ability to log into your app with their existing Twitter or Facebook credentials really is worth the time and effort, let’s take an in-depth look at some of the ways in which authentication can improve the user experience. 1. It’s the only way you can personalize the user experience Once you’ve identified a user, you can potentially customize every part of your app in order to provide a better experience for that specific user. For example, you might filter your app’s content based on the user’s location or the pages they’ve liked on Facebook, or you might move their most frequently-used actions to the top of your application’s menus. Even something as simple as importing the user’s profile picture can add to the overall user experience. As a general rule, the more information you have access to, the more closely you can tailor the user experience. This is where external authentication providers have a huge advantage: if the user signs in via a social network then your app will have access to much more information, compared to if the user signed in with their email address. For example, if a user signs in with Facebook then your app will potentially have access to information ranging from their date of birth, to their location, work history, friends list, and all the pages they’ve liked, which is a huge amount of information to work with. 2. It’s far easier than filling in a registration form Performing any lengthy or complex interactions on the smaller screen of a smartphone or tablet is a frustrating experience, particularly since we tend to use our mobile devices on the go. With his in mind, your users probably aren’t going to be thrilled by the prospect of completing a lengthy registration form before they can even start using your app. Authenticating your users via an external provider like Facebook or Twitter allows you to replace the frustrating and time-consuming registration form with a quick and easy, one-tap ‘Sign in with Twitter/Facebook’ button. Plus, allowing the user to log in with their existing credentials means that your app isn’t adding to the long list of passwords they’re probably already struggling to remember on a day-to-day basis. 3. It gives you the chance to re-engage users who’ve uninstalled your app Once you’ve authenticated a user, you typically have a way of communicating with that user outside of the application context. This may not seem like a big deal when you can just communicate with a user inside your application via things like dialogs and notifications, but it becomes invaluable if that user ever decides to uninstall your app. Since you still have a way of communicating with them, there’s still a chance that you can re-engage them, for example if you have access to the email address associated with a user’s Facebook account, then you might decide to send them an email when you next update your app, just to make sure they’re fully aware of all the great new features they’re missing out on. 4. It’s an important part of providing a seamless user experience, across devices and potentially across platforms Hopefully your users will enjoy your app so much that they’ll install it across all their devices, and user authentication is an essential part of preparing for this best-case scenario. Allowing users to sign in means that your app will be able to identify a user regardless of the device they’re currently using. Since all the authentication methods supported by Firebase are cross-platform, even if you release your app across multiple operating systems then your app have no problems recognizing an individual, regardless of the device they’re currently using. Being able to identify the user based on their login credentials is also crucial if that user ever has to re-install your app. Maybe something goes wrong with the user’s device and they wind up losing all their data, or maybe it’s a happier scenario and they’ve just purchased a new smartphone – whatever the details, they just have to download your app, sign in with their Facebook or Twitter account, and they can pick up exactly where they left off. Adding Firebase Authentication to your Android project Regardless of whether you decide to use Twitter or Facebook authentication, whenever a new user signs into your app you’ll want the Firebase Console to receive a notification and create a unique ID for that user. To create this connection between your app and the Firebase Console, you need to create a new Firebase Console project and enter some information about your app, then add the Firebase Authentication library as a project dependency. You’ll need to perform this setup regardless of the external provider you’re authenticating with: Sign up for a free Firebase account. Log into your Firebase Console. Click the ‘Create New Project’ button. Give your project a name, then click ‘Create Project.’ Select ‘Add Firebase to your Android App.’ Enter your project’s package name. At this point, the Firebase Console dialog will ask you to enter your project’s debug signing certificate (SHA-1). To get this certificate, open your project in Android Studio and then: Select Android Studio’s ‘Gradle’ tab (where the cursor is positioned in the following screenshot). In the new panel that appears, select your application’s root, followed by ‘Tasks >Android > Signing Report.’ Android Studio’s ‘Run’ window should open automatically, but if it doesn’t then you can open it manually by clicking the ‘Run’ tab. Select the ‘Toggle tasks executions/text mode’ button. The ‘Run’ panel will update to display lots of information about your project – including its SHA-1 fingerprint. Paste this SHA-1 fingerprint into the Firebase Console dialog, then click ‘Add App.’ When prompted, select ‘Download google-services.json.’ Click ‘Continue.’ Switch back to Android Studio and make sure you have the ‘Project’ view selected. Drag the newly-downloaded google-services.json file into your project’s ‘app’ directory. Next, open your project-level build.gradle file and add the Google Services plugin to the buildscript dependencies: buildscript {
   repositories {
     jcenter()
   }
   dependencies {
       classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.2'
       classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0' Open your module-level build.gradle file and add the Google Services plugin to the bottom of this file: apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services' Then, add the Firebase Authentication library as a dependency: dependencies {
   compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
   androidTestCompile('com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:2.2.2', {
       exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'support-annotations'
   })
   compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.2.0'
   testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
   compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:10.2.0'
} When prompted, sync your changes. If you do encounter any errors, then double-check that you’ve added Firebase’s google-services.json file to the correct section of your project (it should appear in your project’s ‘apps’ directory). You should also open the SDK Manager and check that you’re running the latest versions of both Google Play Services and the Google Repository. With this setup out of the way, you’re ready to implement your authentication provider of choice – let’s start with Facebook Login. Authenticate with Facebook In order to successfully implement Facebook Login, you’ll need to complete the following steps: Add the Facebook SDK to your project. Create a Facebook Developer account and register your Android app with this account. Copy the App ID and App Secret from your Facebook Developer account, and paste it into both the Firebase Console and your Android application. Paste the OAuth redirect URI from your Facebook Developer account, into the Firebase Console. This redirect URI is essentially a security mechanism that helps prevent redirect attacks by providing a whitelisted URI that should be used to direct the user back to your app, after they’ve completed the Facebook Login dialog. Generate a key hash that’ll be used to authenticate the interactions that happen between the Facebook application and your own app. Create a ‘Log into Facebook’ button in your Android app, and implement the code that’ll handle login events. Add the Facebook SDK to your project Start by opening your project’s module-level build.gradle file and adding the latest version of the Facebook SDK for Android to the dependencies section: dependencies {
   compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
   androidTestCompile('com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:2.2.2', {
      exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'support-annotations'
   })
   compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.2.0'
   testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
   compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:10.2.0'

   // Add the Facebook SDK
   compile 'com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:4.20.0' Facebook publish their SDK to the Maven Central repository, so you’ll need to configure your project to use mavenCentral(). Open your project-level build.gradle file and add mavenCentral to both repository sections: buildscript {
   repositories {
     jcenter()
     mavenCentral()
   } And then: allprojects {
   repositories {
     jcenter()
     mavenCentral()
   }
} Register with Facebook Developers and get your App ID Next, head over to the Facebook Developers website and create your Developer Account. Once you’re logged in, register your Android project by: Clicking the ‘Create App’ button in the upper-right corner of your Facebook Developer account. Give your project a name, select a category, and then click ‘Create App ID.’ This creates a new page within your Facebook Developer account, dedicated to this particular application. Select ‘Dashboard’ from the left-hand menu. This section of the console contains your App iD, plus the App Secret, which you’ll need to add to the Firebase Console and to your actual Android application. In Android Studio, open your project’s Manifest, create a facebook_app_id string, and set it to the value of your App ID. <string name="facebook_app_id">YOUR-UNIQUE-APP-ID</string> You’ll also need to add the App ID plus the App Secret to your Firebase Console, so make sure you have the correct project open in Firebase Console, and then: Find the ‘Authentication’ card and select its accompanying ‘Get started’ button. Select the ‘Sign-In method’ tab. Select ‘Facebook’ from the list. In the subsequent dialog, drag the slider into the ‘Enable’ position. Copy the App ID and the App Secret from your Facebook Developer account, and paste them into the appropriate fields in the Firebase Console dialog. The Firebase Console dialog also contains an OAuth redirect URI that you need to add to your Facebook Developer account. Make a note of this URI, and then click ‘Save’ to close the Firebase dialog. Generate a Key Hash Facebook uses a key hash to authenticate all the interactions that happen between your app and the Facebook application. When you’re developing your app, you’ll typically generate a hash using your default debug keystore, although when it’s time to release your app you’ll need to update this to a release hash. If you’re a Mac user then you can generate a hash key using the debug keystore, by opening your Terminal and running the following command: keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64 If you’re a Windows user, then you’ll need to launch the Command Prompt and enter the following: keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore %HOMEPATH%\.android\debug.keystore | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl
Base64 When prompted, enter the password (for debug.keystore, this is “android”) and the Terminal or Command Prompt will return a 28 character key hash. Next, flick back to your Facebook Developer account and: Select ‘Add Product’ from the left-hand menu. Find ‘Facebook Login’ and click its accompanying ‘Get Started’ button. Select ‘Android.’ You’ve already completed a lot of the steps in this dialog, so keep clicking ‘Next’ until you reach the ‘Tell us about your project’ box. Enter your project’s package name and default class Activity name, then click ‘Save,’ followed by ‘Continue.’ You’ll then be asked to enter a hash key. Enter the debug hash you just generated, then click ‘Save changes’ and ‘Continue.’ The next few screens contain code snippets that you can add to your app, but there’s one final bit of setup we need to complete before we can start coding: adding the oAuth redirect URI to the Facebook Developer account. Note, if you didn’t jot down this URI value then you can find it in the Firebase Console; select the ‘Sign-In Method’ tab and then give ‘Facebook’ a click to open the dialog containing your URI. To enter your URI into your Facebook Developer account, select ‘Facebook Login’ from the left-hand menu. On the subsequent screen, paste the URI into the ‘Valid OAuth redirect URI’ field box, then click ‘Save changes.’ Designing the Facebook Login experience The easiest way to implement the Facebook Login flow, is to use the LoginButton component that’s included in the Facebook SDK. LoginButton is a custom implementation of Android’s standard Button widget, so you can simply drop this button into your layout resource file, for example: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
   xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
   android:id="@+id/activity_main"
   android:layout_width="match_parent"
   android:layout_height="match_parent"
   android:paddingBottom="@dimen/activity_vertical_margin"
   android:paddingLeft="@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin"
   android:paddingRight="@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin"
   android:paddingTop="@dimen/activity_vertical_margin"
   android:orientation="vertical"
   tools:context="com.jessicathornsby.facebooklogin.MainActivity">

<com.facebook.login.widget.LoginButton
       android:id="@+id/login_button"
       android:layout_width="wrap_content"
       android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
</LinearLayout> When the user presses this button, you’ll need to create a callback manager that’ll handle the results of the login attempt (this will either by onSuccess, onError or onCancel). In the following code, I’m implementing these callbacks, but I’m also printing the user’s ID and Auth Token to Android Studio’s Logcat Monitor, so you can see hard proof that a login attempt has been a success. package com.jessicathornsby.facebooklogin;

import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import com.facebook.login.LoginManager;
import com.facebook.login.LoginResult;
import com.facebook.CallbackManager;
import com.facebook.FacebookCallback;
import com.facebook.FacebookException;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.util.Log;
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
   private CallbackManager callbackManager;
   public static final String TAG = "MainActivity";

   @Override
   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

       // Create a callbackManager//
       setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

       // Initialize your instance of callbackManager//
       callbackManager = CallbackManager.Factory.create();

      // Register your callback//
      LoginManager.getInstance().registerCallback(callbackManager,

      // If the login attempt is successful, then call onSuccess and pass the LoginResult//
      new FacebookCallback<LoginResult>() {
          @Override
          public void onSuccess(LoginResult loginResult) {
              // Print the user’s ID and the Auth Token to Android Studio’s Logcat Monitor//
                  Log.d(TAG, "User ID: " +
                        loginResult.getAccessToken().getUserId() + "\n" +
                        "Auth Token: " + loginResult.getAccessToken().getToken());
          }

          // If the user cancels the login, then call onCancel//
          @Override
          public void onCancel() {
          }

          // If an error occurs, then call onError//
          @Override
          public void onError(FacebookException exception) {
          }
     });
   }

   // Override the onActivityResult method and pass its parameters to the callbackManager//
   @Override
   protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
       callbackManager.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
   }
} Update your Manifest Finally, you’ll need to make the following changes to your Manifest: Request the Internet permission so that your app can connect to Facebook’s servers. Add the application ID string (@string/facebook_app_id) as a meta-data element. Define a FacebookActivity, using com.facebook.FacebookActivity. At this point you may also want to add support for Chrome Custom Tabs. This step is optional, but it can provide a better experience for any users who prefer to access their Facebook account via Chrome, rather than via the Facebook for Android app. With Chrome Custom Tabs in place, whenever your app detects that the Facebook for Android app isn’t installed, it’ll launch the Facebook Login dialog as a Chrome Custom Tab, rather than a WebView. This is important as Chrome Custom Tabs share cookies with Chrome, so if the user is logged into Facebook on Chrome then your app will receive their login credentials from Chrome, and they won’t have to input this information manually. This step is optional, but since it can improve the user experience, I’m also adding it to my Manifest. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
   package="com.jessicathornsby.facebooklogin">

   // Add the Internet permission//
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>

   <application
       android:allowBackup="true"
       android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
       android:label="@string/app_name"
       android:supportsRtl="true"
       android:theme="@style/AppTheme">

        //Reference your App ID string//
        <meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId" android:value="@string/facebook_app_id"/>
        <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
           <intent-filter>
               <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
               <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
           </intent-filter>
        </activity>

       // Add a Facebook Activity//
       <activity android:name="com.facebook.FacebookActivity"
           android:configChanges=
               "keyboard|keyboardHidden|screenLayout|screenSize|orientation"
           android:label="@string/app_name" />

       // Implement support for Chrome Custom Tabs//
       <activity
           android:name="com.facebook.CustomTabActivity"
           android:exported="true">
           <intent-filter>
               <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
               <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
               <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
               <data android:scheme="@string/facebook_app_id" />
          </intent-filter>
       </activity>
   </application>
</manifest> You can download this project (minus the google-services.json file, App ID and App Secret) from GitHub. Authenticate with Twitter In order to implement Twitter Login in your app, you’ll need to complete the following steps: Register your Android app in the Twitter Application Manager. Find your project’s unique Consumer Key and Consumer Secret, and add this information to the Firebase Console and to your Android project. Add Fabric’s Twitter Kit to your Android application. Register your app with the Fabric platform. Implement the Twitter Login flow. Register your app with the Twitter Application Manager Start by heading over to the Twitter Application Manager, log in with your Twitter credentials and click ‘Create New App.’ When prompted, enter the following information about your project: Your application name. This is the title that’ll be included in all your app’s user-facing Twitter authorization dialogs. Description. 10 to 200 character describing your application. Again, this information will be included in all user-facing authorization screens. Website. The homepage associated with your application, which will also be included in your app’s authorization screens. Callback URL. This is the URL where Twitter should redirect the user after they’ve completed the Twitter authentication dialog. Leave this field blank for now. When prompted, read the Developer Agreement, and if you’re happy to proceed then click ‘Create your Twitter Application.’ At this point you’ll be taken to your project’s dedicated Application Management page. Share your API Key and Consumer Key The next step is copying the key from your project’s Application Management page, and sharing this information with the Firebase Console and your Android project. You’ll find your project’s unique Consumer Key (also known as the API Key) and Consumer Secret (also known as the API Secret), by selecting the Application Management’s ‘Keys and Access Tokens’ tab. Add this information to your Android project, by opening your strings.xml file and creating twitter_consumer_key and twitter_consumer_secret strings: <resources>
  <string name="twitter_consumer_key" translatable="false">YOURKEY</string>
  <string name="twitter_consumer_secret" translatable="false">YOURKEY</string>
</resources> Next, head over to the Firebase Console and: Select the project you’re currently working with. Find the ‘Authentication’ card and select its accompanying ‘Get started’ button. Select the ‘Sign-In method’ tab. Choose ‘Twitter’ from the list, and in the subsequent dialog set the slider to the ‘Enable’ position. Copy the ‘API Key’ and the ‘API Secret’ from the Twitter Application Management Console, and paste them into the Firebase Console dialog. The Firebase Console also contains a callback URL that you’ll need to add to your project’s Twitter Application Management page. Copy this URL, and then click ‘Save’ to close the Firebase Console dialog. Flick back to your project’s Twitter Application Management page. Select the ‘Settings’ tab, then paste the URL into the ‘Callback URL’ field and click ‘Update Settings.’ Install Fabric for Android Studio Fabric is a mobile platform that contains various modular kits, including a Twitter Kit that you can use to integrate Twitter functionality into your Android apps. Before you can use this kit, you’ll need to install the Fabric plugin, so sign up for a free Fabric account and then complete the following steps in Android Studio: Select ‘Android Studio’ from the toolbar, followed by ‘Preferences…’ Select ‘Plugins’ from the left-hand menu. Give the ‘Browse Repositories….’ button a click. Find ‘Fabric for Android Studio,’ then click ‘Install.’ Restart Android Studio when prompted. Once Android Studio has restarted, you’ll notice a new ‘Fabric’ button in the toolbar – give this button a click. A new Firebase window will open in your Android Studio window. Select the accompanying ‘Power’ button. Enter the email address and password you used to create your Fabric account, then click the ‘Power’ button again. Select the project you’re currently working with, then click ‘Next.’ At this point, you can choose which kits you want to work with; select ‘Twitter.’ Select the ‘Twitter: Install’ button. Click ‘I already have a Twitter account’ and enter your Twitter username and password. Fabric will then prompt you for a Twitter/API Key and Twitter/Build Secret. You’ll find this information in the Fabric Dashboard. Copy the API Key and Build Secret into Android Studio, then click ‘Next’ to close this dialog. Next, open your project-level build.gradle file and add Fabric’s Maven Repository and the io.fabric.tools:gradle buildscript dependency: buildscript {
   repositories {
       jcenter()
       // Add mavenCentral//
       mavenCentral()
       maven { url 'https://maven.fabric.io/public' }
   }
   dependencies {
       classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.2'
       classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0'
       // Add io.fabric.tools:gradle//
       classpath 'io.fabric.tools:gradle:1.+'
   }
}

allprojects {
   repositories {
       jcenter()
       // Add mavenCentral//
       maven { url 'https://maven.fabric.io/public' }
       mavenCentral()
   }
} You’ll also need to add the io.fabric plugin and the Twitter Core Kit to your module-level build.gradle file: apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

//Add the Fabric plugin//

apply plugin: 'io.fabric'
...
...
...

dependencies {
   compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
   androidTestCompile('com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:2.2.2', {
       exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'support-annotations'
   })
   compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.2.0'
   testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
   compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:10.2.0'

   // Add the Twitter Core Kit//
   compile('com.twitter.sdk.android:twitter:[email protected] ') {
       transitive = true;
   }
} Add your Fabric API Key Fabric assigns you an organization key that you’ll need to add to your project’s Manifest. Head over to the Fabric Dashboard, select your organization and then click the ‘API Key’ text to reveal your key. Open your project’s Manifest and add this key as a meta-data element inside your <application> tag: <meta-data
      android:name="io.fabric.ApiKey"
      android:value="YOUR-API-KEY-HERE" /> While you have the Manifest open, you’ll also need to request the Internet permission so that your app can interact with Twitter’s servers: <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /> Register your application with Fabric Once all of this setup is complete, you’ll need to register your app with the Fabric platform, which requires you to build and run your app. Either attach a physical Android device to your development machine or launch an AVD, and then select ‘Run > Run App’ from the Android Studio toolbar. After a few moments, you should receive an email confirming that a new app has been added to your Fabric account. Open this email and click its ‘View Details’ button, and you’ll be taken to your app’s dedicated page within your Fabric account. When prompted, read through the ‘Twitter Kit Agreement’ and ‘Developer Agreement’ and confirm that you’re happy to proceed by clicking ‘Get Started.’ Crafting the Twitter Login experience Similar to the Facebook SDK, the Twitter Core Kit contains a standard Twitter Login button that you can drop into your layout, so open the layout resource file where you want to start the Twitter Login experience, and add the following: <com.twitter.sdk.android.core.identity.TwitterLoginButton
     android:id="@+id/login_button"
     android:layout_width="wrap_content"
     android:layout_height="wrap_content" /> In the accompanying Activity file, you’ll need to create a callback that handles the results of the user’s login attempts, and then attach this callback to your Twitter Login button. Once the user has successfully signed in with Twitter, you’ll also need to exchange the OAuth access token and OAuth secret for a Firebase credential, which you can use to authenticate with Firebase. Similar to our Facebook app, in the following code I’m also creating a listener (AuthStateListener) that’ll print a message to Android Studio’s Logcat every time the user’s sign-in state changes. package com.jessicathornsby.twitterlogin;

Authentication best practices After you’ve gone to all the effort of implementing user authentication, you’ll want to ensure as many people take advantage of this feature as possible. In this section, I’m going to share a few best practices that’ll increase the odds of your users hitting that ‘Sign In’ button. 1. Clearly communicate the benefits You users should understand the benefits of everything your app asks them to do, but this is particularly important when you’re asking them to hand over personal information such as their Facebook credentials. For the highest conversion rates, you should clearly communicate the benefits of signing into your app, before presenting your users with that ‘Sign In’ button. This could take the form of a promo video demonstrating your app’s features in action, a series of screenshots, or it may even be something as simple as a few bullet points. 2. Give the user a choice Whenever possible you should give your users the option to use your app without signing in, because if a user isn’t keen on the idea of authenticating with Facebook or Twitter, and you don’t give them the option to use your app anonymously, then you’re probably going to lose them. However, if your app allows anonymous users then there’s still a chance that they may change their mind and sign in at a later date. If you do allow anonymous users, then make sure they’re full aware of all the features and content they’re missing out on, as this will make them more likely to take the plunge and sign up at a later data. 3. Make signing in as straightforward as possible As a general rule, the easier the sign in process is, the more users will sign up. We’re already off to a good start by using Facebook and Twitter authentication rather than requiring users to fill in a registration form, but you should still be on the lookout for any opportunities to simplify the login process. For example, if there’s a ‘Registration’ button on your app’s homepage that leads to a ‘Log in with Facebook’ button, then you may want to consider cutting out the middleman and placing that Facebook button directly on your app’s homepage. If the user does authenticate using an external provider, then you should avoid asking them to enter any additional information on top of this authentication, and in particular never ask the user to create an additional username or password specifically for your app. Both of these actions are likely to leave the user wondering what exactly was the point of authenticating with Facebook or Twitter in the first place, and in the worst case scenario they may even suspect that your app has deliberately tricked them into handing over their social network credentials. 4. Limit the permissions you request at login When you use external authentication providers, you may need to request some permissions that are specific to that provider, for example Facebook Login supports over 30 Facebook-specific permissions. However, wherever possible you should avoid making permission requests during authentication, as you don’t want to risk scaring the user off at such a crucial point in the onboarding process. In fact, according to the Facebook Developer docs, apps that request more than four permissions during authentication experience a significant drop in the number of completed logins. 5. Consider including some supporting text Placing text alongside your login buttons can sometimes give uncertain users that little extra push, convincing them to sign into your app. For social logins like Facebook or Twitter, you may want to include some text stressing how easy it is to sign up (“In a hurry? Sign in with your existing Facebook account and you’ll be up and running in seconds”) or take the opportunity to reassure your users that you won’t post anything to their Facebook or Twitter accounts without their permission. 6. Provide a way to log out Although this entire tutorial has been geared towards getting users to sign into your app, feeling trapped isn’t exactly a great user experience, so don’t forget to provide your users with a way of signing out. And even though it’s probably the last thing you want your users to do, you should provide them with a way of permanently deleting their account. 8. Don’t forget to test! You should test your app’s login experience across a range of conditions, including less-than-ideal scenarios such as how your app reacts if a user attempts to sign in with an outdated Facebook password, or if the Internet cuts out halfway through the authentication process. You should also try and get feedback on your app’s onboarding experience, ideally from users who represent your target audience. You can then use their feedback to help improve the login experience. Wrapping up In this article we looked at how to implement Facebook and Twitter login, using Firebase Authentication. When exploring the Firebase Console, you may have noticed that Firebase Authentication supports some methods we haven’t looked at – namely GitHub, Google, and email/password authentication. If you do decide to implement one or more of these methods, then all of the setup (creating a new Firebase project, registering your app with the Firebase Console, and adding the Firebase Authentication library) will be exactly the same, so you’ll be able to use the information at the start of this tutorial to get a head start on adding more sign in methods to your app. Do you plan on adding user authentication to your Android apps?

The announcement and presentation of the award took place at Google's European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland.  Head of the Google Certified Publishing Partner Program, Sean Meng, presented the award directly to Ezoic Founder & CEO, Dwayne Lafleur. "This award is really a reflection of the success that publishers have achieved by partnering with Ezoic technology," said Lafleur. "Our platform is transforming how websites monetize their ad inventory and improve experiences for their users at the same time. More and more publishers join our platform every day and we expect that trend to continue as we continue to share the results that our true machine learning platform provides." The Google Certified Publishing Partner Team used an open competition to decide the winner of the Business Innovation award. The competition looked at the observable business impact of approaches, services, or technologies that partners had supplied to publishers and website owners to help them in their businesses. Ezoic's ad testing application, Ad Tester — which uses real artificial intelligence to optimize ad combinations on the publisher's website — emerged as the competition winner. Ezoic's ad testing application had already been featured in the Google AdSense blog two months prior to the award for helping several publishers significantly increase their ad revenue. Ezoic's new Vice President of Global Partnerships, Ohad Tzur, who joined from Google in November 2016, believes that this is just a sign of things still to come, "The recent accolades and press surrounding Ezoic represent the value our technology provides to publishers. We've formed relationships with industry leaders, large publishers and technology providers, bringing additional value to their businesses in an intelligent and data-driven manner. This is something we're very proud of." Ezoic has consistently been in the news over the past 6 months. Most recently, Ezoic was responsible for launching a publicly available Ad Revenue Index; which easily allows anyone to view ad earning trends for websites across the internet. It continues a trend of behaviors from the organization to make data, tools, and information available to online publishers at no cost. "We think that education and data are foundational elements of success. We make it our business to provide these things to publishers and partners in the most thoughtful and intelligent ways possible. Everyone who works at Ezoic should be proud of this new award and what it signifies for our customers," Lafleur finished. About Ezoic Ezoic is a Google Certified Publishing Partner that specializes in providing smart technology to online publishers designed to personalize user experiences by leveraging machine learning. Their flagship application allows publishers the ability to automatically test and serve individualized ad combinations to website visitors to maximize ad earnings and optimize user experience metrics at the same time (like bounce rate and pageviews per visit).   To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ezoic-ad-testing-application-wins-google-business-innovation-award-300427060.html SOURCE Ezoic Copyright (C) 2017 PR Newswire.

(Photo: AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE San Francisco — Google wants to make it easier for you to find answers and recommendations on smartphones without having to think about what to ask its search engine. Its new feature, called “shortcuts,” will appear as a row of icons below the Google search box. Instead of having to ponder and then speak or type a request, the shortcuts will let you tap the icons to get the latest weather, movie showtimes, sports scores, restaurant recommendations and other common requests. The shortcuts will begin appearing Tuesday in updates to Google’s app for iPhones, Android phones and its mobile website. The Android app will also include various tools such as a currency converter, a language translator and an ATM locator, which you can also summon with a tap. Those tools may eventually make it to the iPhone as well, although Google says it doesn’t know when. Your backup brain The changes are the latest step in Google’s quest to turn its search engine into a secondary brain that anticipates people’s needs and desires. The search engine gleans these insights by analyzing your past requests and, when you allow it, tracking your location, a practice that periodically raises privacy concerns about Google’s power to create digital profiles of its users. Based on the knowledge that Google already has accumulated, its shortcuts feature may already list your favorite sports teams or recommend nearby restaurants serving cuisines you prefer. Shortcuts also show how Google’s search engine has been adapting to its audience, now that smartphones have become the primary way millions of people stay connected to the internet. Going mobile Since more than half of requests for Google’s search engine now come from smartphones, the Mountain View, California, company has adapted its services to smaller screens, touch keyboards and apps instead of websites. Early in that process, Google tweaked its search engine to answer many requests with factual summaries at the top of its results page, a change from simply displaying a list of links to other websites. Voice-recognition technology also allows you to speak your request into a phone instead of typing it. The transition is going well so far. Google’s revenue rose 20 percent last year to $89 billion, propelled by digital ads served up on its search engine, YouTube and Gmail. Although shortcuts won’t initially show ads after you tap them, Google typically sells marketing space if a feature or service becomes popular.
