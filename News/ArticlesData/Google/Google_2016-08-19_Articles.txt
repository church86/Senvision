Tue, 08/16/2016 - 09:45 Google Launches 'Duo', A New Facetime Video Chat Rival Google promised Android 7.0 Nougat would be released during the summer, and a recent leak indicates the new operating system will be available starting Aug. 22. On Friday, tech blog Mobilesyrup shared a leaked document indicating the Canadian carrier Telus will begin rolling out Android Nougat to various smartphones on Monday. Devices include the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X and Blackberry Priv. Typically, Google’s most recent Nexus smartphones are the first to receive new Android updates, so the leak seems valid in that sense. Google revealed the name of its coming OS, previously referred to as Android N, in late June. The tech giant unveiled a Nougat themed lawn statue following a contest where fans voted for the Android N name. Since then, release details for the software have been scarce, outside of developer preview software releases. The final developer’s preview for Android N hit Nexus devices July 18, so enthusiasts are certain the official release is coming soon. However, Google has yet to comment on rollout plans. The 2016 Nexus smartphones accompanying Android Nougat are also expected to debut soon. Rumors indicate HTC will manufacture both a high-end phablet and mid-range slate smartphone for Google. Leaks suggest at least one of the devices may resemble the HTC 10. There is no word on when the smartphones, codenamed Marlin and Sailfish , will be available. However, we can be certain that it won’t be until after Sept. 6, when LG plans to launch the LG V20 . T h e c o m p a n y is already marketing the device as the first smartphone to run Android 7.0 Nougat. This means the LG V20 will be announced, and possibly also released for purchase, before Google’s Nexus devices.

In fact, Google’s move beyond organic growth suggests that the race may be ramping up a notch, particularly when the other competitors in the market include Comcast, AT&T, and a larger Charter Communications. A larger question remains. Will consumers continue to demand, and be willing to pay for, ever faster broadband speeds? Consumer Perception of Current Broadband Speeds One of the challenges in selling faster broadband services is consumers don’t necessarily know what “faster” really means. Historically, most consumers have little idea what broadband speed they have in their home, much less how much speed that they actually need. In recent Parks Associates survey results, 43% of U.S. broadband households are unwilling to guess at their broadband speed, even when provided broad ranges as options. An additional 7% claim to subscribe to gigabit-speed services, a figure that seems high when considering the limited availability of such service offerings. Often, consumers only encounter their broadband speed infrequently, including the time that they choose a broadband package or in instances when they encounter slowdowns or lag in their broadband performance. However, some never note their subscribed broadband speed, particularly those that purchase broadband as part of a larger bundle, did not participate in their household’s selection of a service, or are not tech-savvy enough to perform an online speed test. Among consumer groups, younger consumers, multiscreen video users, and connected device owners are more likely to claim knowledge of their broadband speed than average consumers. In each case, these groups are more likely to experience their broadband service on a regular basis and to have encountered performance problems that would cause them to seek out that information. Balancing Speed and Price Across the US market, operators are aggressively pushing high-speed services, both to cover network investments and to counter competitive offerings. Migrating consumers to these higher speeds involves a three-way dance among the operator, consumers, and competitors. As competitive speeds within a market area increase, operators are faced with a difficult choice—wait for consumers to upgrade to a faster tier (at a higher price) or lift all subscribers in the area to a faster speed at their current price. Waiting for consumers to act allows the operator to enjoy higher revenues but risks churn. Generally, few households downgrade their broadband service. Only 7% of broadband households that claim their current broadband speed is faster than needed plan to downgrade to a less expensive service. This finding implies that most consumers do not perceive the unused speed and throughput as wasteful despite a belief that their speeds are higher than needed. As operators define their messaging and broadband product strategies, they must carefully strike a balance between the speed and prices offered in order to attract new subscribers. Over 50% of consumers indicate that their choice of a new provider was impacted by speed/price considerations. Operators need to continuously re-balance their offerings based on competitive offerings available. At present, faster speeds are resonating with a larger share of consumers than are lower prices in moving consumers to switch providers. While pricing matters, today’s consumers are driven by an increasing reliance on broadband for a variety of communication, functional, and entertainment needs—many of which are throughput intensive. This speed-based churn motivation suggests that current speeds are still not fully addressing consumers’ appetite for more and that demand for increasingly higher speeds will continue. Managing Consumer Expectations Among current broadband households, 50 Mbps appears to be an important inflection point for perception of broadband speed. The percentage of consumers that perceive their broadband speed as slower than needed drops sharply for those that claim to receive a service of 50 Mbps or more. At the same time, the percentage of consumers that perceive their broadband speed as faster than needed more than doubles for households with speeds of over 50 Mbps. Interestingly, surveys show that consumers with very high-speed connections still want faster broadband connections, even when their current speed is well above the average for other broadband households. As homes become accustomed to regular, robust broadband service and in-home Wi-Fi connections, they become increasingly reliant upon easy access and high-speed performance. The availability and quality of broadband quickly achieves the same level of expectations among consumers as the availability and quality of water or electricity—consumers never want to run out or run low. Excess is perceived as a safety net, just in case the consumer might need to use it. These consumers assess the quality of their broadband service by its performance and the operator by the number of connection problems encountered. Rather than being motivated by the benefits of broadband (which they already appreciate), they are motivated by avoidance of problems. By Parks Associates’ estimates, half of US broadband households will be smart homes by 2020. 44% of households who do not already own a smart home device plan to purchase one this year. The groundwork is laid for continued growth in 2016 and beyond by increased access to fixed and mobile broadband, the main catalyst for the connected home and consumer-based IoT. Operators hoping to capitalize on this expanding market will face difficult decisions regarding re-pricing and re-positioning of service tiers, keeping a close eye on consumer expectations, and increasing competition.

Industry > Industry monitor > Telecom More reports on: Apple, Google Apple, Google join hands to strike at Robocallers news 20 August 2016 More than 30 tech leaders including Google parent Alphabet, Apple and telecom service providers have joined hands to crack down on automated phone calls, Reuters reported. The "Robocall Strike Force," a group led by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), held its first hearing on the subject in Washington DC on Friday. Both prerecorded messages from misleading phone numbers and automated text messages. The FCC has roped in companies like Apple, Google's parent Alphabet, AT&T, and Verizon in an effort to end the nuisance of unsolicited calls playing prerecorded messages from advertisers including big corporations. "We know there is a problem. We know how much consumers dislike these calls," said FCC commissioner Mignon L Clyburn. "We know the public is frustrated, because they assumed that after they registered for the 'Do Not Call' list, this would stop. It did not, so now it is time to take some real action." The strike force is expected to submit its report to the FCC by 19th October with "concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions," said AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, who is the chairman of the coalition. These solutions could take the form of Caller ID verification standards capable of blocking spoofed phone numbers, as also a list of numbers from government agencies and banks that telemarketers would not be able to spoof. The strike force would report to the FCC by 19 Ocotober on "concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions," SReuters reported. "This scourge must stop," Wheeler said yesterday calling robocalls the No 1 complaint from consumers. "The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology," FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said. In the past, he has said robocalls continue "due in large part to industry inaction."  search domain-b    go Legal Policy | Copyright © 1999-2016 The Information Company Private Limited.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google announced on Friday that it will stop supporting Chrome apps in 2018. The company said that the apps were originally developed for a younger Web, back when developers didn’t have such advanced tools, like support for offline products or notifications. Things have changed, though, and so have Chrome’s users, so Google is adapting. You probably won’t even miss much. In fact, Google explained that just 1 percent of its users across Windows, Mac and Linux are actually “actively [using] Chrome packaged apps, and most hosted apps are already implemented as regular Web apps.” To start the transition, Google said it’ll clear out all of its Chrome apps from the Web store beginning during the second half of next year. Support will end in 2018. Google says developers should just migrate their current Chrome apps to the web. “As the capabilities of the web continue to grow, we’re excited to see what developers build next,” Google VP of product development Rahul Roy-Chowdhury said. “Alongside other browser vendors, we remain committed to investment in the web and enabling users and developers to benefit from its openness and reach.” Good point. By 2018, we’ll all be nose-deep in Oculus Rift units living in virtual reality anyway.

Apparently, the app is still not available for download via the Play Store or Apple App Store. But still, this doesn’t mean we can’t get our hands on what this Google Allo app is all about. With Google marketing these two apps as the simplest and easiest to use when it comes to handling their respective tasks, be ready for apps that are very “small” when it comes to features. Google Duo has a feature known as Knock Knock. With this feature, users can see the background of the caller even before they answer the call. On the opposite end, Google Allo has the ability to delete messages from a conversation, a feature that is expected to help drive masses towards downloading the app, especially those with concerns about their privacy. The option to delete messages from a given conversation is one of the best things that can happen to an IM. In fact, this feature sits high on the priority list of most users when it comes to choosing which app to use for communication purposes. Considering that Google Hangouts doesn’t offer such a feature, the implementation of the delete function in Google Allo will for sure help grab the attention of not just current users of Hangouts, but also those on other messaging apps. Don’t expect anything strange with this Google Allo implementation. All one will need to do is select a given message they want to delete and get rid of it, but apparently, it is still not possible to do so for multiple messages in a conversation.  Although this feature is only available on the beta version of the app, there are chances that Google will launch the full version with a much more enhanced delete function. Who knows, the app could come with a feature similar to disappearing messages, but probably with a different implementation like with the case of Yahoo Messenger. With Google Allo also dealing with media files, the delete function also incorporates such files. According to Android Police, selecting a media file, for instance, a photo, for deletion purposes will prompt a message asking whether you also want to delete the same photo from your device’s storage. Google Allo should be released very soon now that Google Duo is already out.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Windows-Windows+ iOS-iOS+ BlackBerry-BlackBerry+ Android-Android+ According to the latest data from Statista, Android handsets made up 86.2% of smartphones sold globally during the first half of the year. The previous high water mark, 84.7%, was set in the third quarter of 2015. Sales of iPhone units (12.9%) are in a recent downtrend, but the platform is firmly lodged in second place with Windows Phone and BlackBerry sliding into oblivion. Interestingly, for the second quarter of 2009 it was Symbian that led the way with a 51% share of global sales. BlackBerry was next with 19%, followed by iOS with 13%. 9% of global smartphone sales in that quarter belonged to Windows Mobile and Android brought up the rear at 2% Basically, Apple has held a steady share of sales since, while all other platforms saw its users leave for Android. By the first quarter of 2011, Android sales topped those of Symbian and Google's open source OS never looked back again. During the second quarter of this year, 296.91 million Android phones were shipped globally compared with 44.4 million iPhone models. 1.97 million Windows Phone units were delivered, and 400,000 BlackBerry handsets were in transit. Compare that to the second quarter of 2009 when 20.88 million Symbian phones were shipped. BlackBerry had 7.78 million handsets delivered during those three months. 5.33 million iPhones were in transit followed by 3.83 million Windows Mobile units. Only 760,000 Android handsets were shipped during Q2 of 2009. It's all fascinating stuff, and for those of us who were writing about the industry during this time period, it was obvious that a change was coming. We often refer to the launch of the Motorola DROID in November 2009 as being the catalyst for Android's amazing rise. It was the first phone with Android 2.0. Consider that the quarter before the DROID was released, 760,000 Android phones were shipped. By the the first quarter of 2010, 5.23 million Android handsets were delivered. And with the Nexus One released that quarter, shipments soared to 10.65 million during Q2 of 2010.

And the only reason why iOS isn't number one right now is because Apple was incredibly shortsighted and signed a contract with AT&T making the iPhone exclusive to that carrier until early 2011 allowing the rest of the world to accept the alternative mobile OS, Android. posted on 21 Aug 2016, 13:58 0 in response to #97 in response to #97 Hide Reply 98. kiko007 (Posts: 2987; Member since: 17 Feb 2016) To this day, I still think that decision was stupid on Apple's part.

Yes, Apple is doing well for the share they currently have, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to what they could have had if they hadn't denied the rest of the world the opportunity to buy their product. Instead, they left the door wide open for competition to fill the void. Which in the end, it's a good thing that things went the way they did, at least for a consumer standpoint.

BobbyDigital (Posts: 2026; Member since: 29 May 2014) I believe they went exclusive with At&t because no other carrier thought the iPhone would sell. Verizon flat out denied to even carry the iPhone while T-Mobile and Sprint needed to be convinced it would sell.

If Android and iOS were released at the same time and priced identically, I'm confident in assuming Android would have still dominated the market due to hardware features, OEM options and the ability to customize your experience...most people prefer to stand out from one other and convey their own unique tastes. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 04:13 0 in response to #118 in response to #118 Hide Reply 123. kiko007 (Posts: 2987; Member since: 17 Feb 2016) I don't know about that man....Android used to be pretty iffy most of the time.

Hell, Google didn't even do that much to Android before shipping it to the masses. They just bought it.....threw a ribbon on a turd (it's a lot better now than it used to be.....trust me) and called it an operating system.

Elaborate..... because nothing I said was false by any stretch of the imagination. Google (who licenses Android for free) gave it to OEMs with the intention if creating mini-ecosystems while maintaing a much larger one. OEMs, took the opportunity to combat Apple with similar offerings, but different software features to compensate for lackluster performance. It is a symbiotic relationship for the most part. The only OEM with the gumption to create it's own OS is Samsung, and Tizen isn't doing too hot these days. The rest are nothing more than forks, offering different UI components while maintaining Google's portfolio. posted on 21 Aug 2016, 12:26 5 in response to #75 in response to #75 Hide Reply 92. tedkord (Posts: 12120; Member since: 17 Jun 2009) Mainly the part about Google not doing much to Android before shipping it, "putting a ribbon on a turd."

Don't get distracted by Alphabet's Other Bets segment. It still derives 99% of its sales from advertising, and that's by no means a bad thing. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Aug 20, 2016 at 7:06PM In case you hadn't realized, life isn't bad for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOG) shareholders. In the roughly 12 months since its surprise corporate reorganization, Alphabet shares have handily outperformed its benchmark index, the tech-weighted Nasdaq Composite. GOOG data by YCharts. Moreover, Alphabet and/or Google shares have utterly trounced the market since their 2004 IPO, gaining roughly 1,330% compared to about a 200% gain from the Nasdaq. So how does Alphabet do it? What's the secret sauce behind its astounding financial success? As it turns out, the answer is fairly straightforward. Advertisements: Alphabet's financial fuel For those with only a passing familiarity, Alphabet's financial performance relies almost entirely on advertising, which comes exclusively from its Google operating subsidiary. As you can see below, advertising accounted for over 99% of Alphabet's revenue in 2015. Here's the company's revenue composition over the past three years.   2013 2014 2015 Other Bets segment  $12  $327  $448 Google segment  $55,507  $65,674  $74,541 Alphabet total revenue  $55,519  $66,001  $74,989 Google as a percentage of Alphabet revenue 100% 99.5% 99.4% Source: Alphabet Investor Relations. This might come as something of a surprise to the casual observer, particularly given the outsized attention that Alphabet receives for its splashy, but currently uneconomical, Other Bets segment. With regards to its forward-looking ambitions, Alphabet has become an incredibly diverse company. In addition to its profit center, Google search business, Alphabet also controls the world's most popular operating system Android, online video juggernaut YouTube, ultra-fast internet service Google Fiber, smart home-appliance maker Nest, an autonomous driving-car project, and a litany of additional projects. At least in part due to the media's proclivity toward the new and exciting, Alphabet's futuristic projects garner far more attention than they contribute financially to the company, though many of its projects admittedly carry ample long-term financial potential. However, in the here and now, Alphabet funds itself and its bold bets on the future of technology through plain old advertising, which, as it turns out, still offers investors plenty of future upside. More room to run Alphabet has a market capitalization exceeding a half-trillion dollars, so it may be fair to wonder how much farther online advertising alone can propel the company's stock. Fortunately, it appears quite a bit. According to researcher eMarketer, digital market spending in the U.S. alone is expected to increase from roughly $69 billion this year to over $105 billion by 2020. Image Source: Alphabet. In another sign of its increasing dominance, digital advertising will overtake TV advertising, long the gold standard of the marketing world, to become the most utilized advertising channel in the U.S. as soon as next year. With Alphabet holding over 50% market share in this space, expect the company to continue to benefit from this long-term secular growth story. As a result of its position at the epicenter of the digital-marketing industry, Alphabet appears well positioned as one of the first tech companies to eclipse a $1 trillion valuation. At the same time, though, it bears noting that the company's size likely means that Alphabet isn't necessarily the growth stock it once was. As we've seen with other mega-cap tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Berkshire Hathaway, size can be its own impediment for driving future returns, though these companies' business models crucially differ from Alphabet's, and Alphabet has certainly been proactive in investing for future growth. Much as it is today, Alphabet figures to remain dependent on advertising well into at least the medium term. However, as discussed above, that should prove more a benefit than a detriment to the company as its overall market continues to expand for years to come.

Hold On... We May Actually Be In For A THIRD Oracle/Google API Copyright Trial from the you-wouldn't-reimplement-an-api dept Yikes. A month ago, we wrote about how Oracle was asking Judge Alsup to agree to another new trial in the Oracle v. Google API copyright case. I joked that they basically had no chance, and Judge Alsup had already rejected their attempts to overturn the jury ruling. But... I may have spoken too soon. In a hearing on the matter earlier this week, Oracle insisted that there needed to be a new trial because Google had withheld information on plans to offer Android on Chromebooks -- something that Google announced at this year's Google IO which happened (awkward!) while the trial was going on. And this morning, Alsup issued an order telling both sides to provide sworn statements about this. For Google, it's why it had not updated its discovery responses to include the plans for Android on Chromebooks, and for Oracle, whether it, too, had neglected to update its discovery responses (and specifically calls out a misrepresentation by Oracle): By THURSDAY AUGUST 25, AT NOON, Christa Anderson, counsel for Google, shall submit a sworn statement explaining why the discovery responses referenced in Court yesterday were not updated, including the full extent to which counsel knew Google’s intention to launch a full version of Marshmallow, including the Google Play Store, for Chrome OS. By the same date and time, Annette Hurst, counsel for Oracle, shall submit a sworn statement setting forth, after full inquiry, the full extent to which Oracle neglected to update its discovery responses by reason, in whole or in part, of one or more rulings by the judge. The same statement shall explain why counsel repeatedly represented that the Jones v. Aero/chem decision required an “evidentiary hearing” when that decision, as it turns out, made no mention of an “evidentiary hearing” and instead remanded because no “hearing” or other consideration at all had been given to the issue of discovery conduct by the district judge. This does not mean that there absolutely will be a third trial, but it's at least more of a possibility than most observers thought possible. I honestly don't see how Android on Chromebook really matters for the fair use analysis. Oracle argues that since most of the talk on the market impact was limited to phones and tablets, that may have impacted the jury, but that's kind of laughable. The reality is that Oracle just wants another crack at a decision it disagrees with. Of course, all of this is really a stupid side show. The real underlying problem was the Federal Circuit's decision that APIs were covered by copyright, despite almost no one actually thinking that's true. The whole fair use trial was an awkward mess, mainly because all of the arguments weren't so much about "fair use" but about whether or not anyone actually considered APIs to be covered by copyright. Going through another such trial would just be a mess. But the other area where a new case may come about is that Judge Alsup made clear that Oracle was also free to bring new cases on new uses of Android to see if they were also fair use, meaning that any time Google does anything new with Android, it may face a new fair use trial. They wouldn't need to do this if the CAFC had just recognized that APIs are not covered by copyright, but it didn't and here we are in a big heaping mess.

[ reply to this | link to this | view in thread ] royleith (profile), Aug 20th, 2016 @ 1:46am Oracle Gave Google A License for Java SE The point of this case is that Java SE is licensed for 'General Purpose Desktop Computers', but not for mobile phones. Sun wanted Java to be implemented on as many general purpose computer platforms as possible and roped in many organisations, including Apache, to make this happen. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html (Note: the original Sun licence in force during Google's development of Android did not refer to tablets and was much more loosely phrased. Oracle 'tightened it up' after the start of the case. Google never used Sun's binary code, but used the Sun licensed Apache code. The Sun license must apply to the API as well as any Sun binary code otherwise the licence is useless for Sun's desktop plans.) Oracle were incensed that their plans for a money-making, Java-based, mobile phone OS were stymied by Android. That is why there was all the discussion about mobile phones and tablets in the case because that's the basis of the complaint. Google Chrome is a general purpose computer. It has a full Java SE licence. It can also use the open source Java JDK licensed by Sun. If Oracle are going to sue every Unix/Linux based general purpose computer OS that implements or uses Java SE, then that is the end of Java.

They have been know to watch for announcements of IT improvement projects that increase the number of cores and virtual systems which all need a separate license for their products. Even better, IMO, are the ones regarding trying to get out of a contract with Oracle. Those efforts are much like this trail.

Define your site main menu javascript:void(0) The javascript:void(0) error is fairly unique, in that it  is one of the few computer-based errors that can be encountered by users of any operating system. The error is thrown on web browsers with the end-user surfs to websites that are not fully compatible with the version of Internet browser being used or have a javascript-related error. If you encounter the error while surfing to various Internet web pages, there are a number of common fixes that can be applied in order to solve the issue. What is Javascript? Javascript is an interpreted programming language that has been embedded in web browsers for a number of years. It is formally defined in the ECMAScript language standard and primarily is deployed in web browsers.  The language allows client-side scripts to be embedded within webpages to help the end-user interact with websites, control the browser, dynamically alter content, and is very common in game and desktop application development. The language is type-safe, dynamic is was significantly influenced by the C programming language. There are a number of naming conventions copied from the Java programming language; however, that is where the similarity with Java stops. Modern Javascript is based on the Scheme and Self programming languages and support object orientated, functional, and imperative programming styles in implementation. Use of the language has grown to include desktop widgets, PDF documents, and site-specific browsers today. There have also been a number of Javascript frameworks released which feature faster performance that have aided in the popularity of the script on the server-side for Internet applications. Due to the increased popularity of the language, the number of locations that an end-user can run into the javascript:void(0) error has significantly increased over the past decade. Common Causes of the Javascript:void(0) Error The common causes of the  javascript:void(0) error include anti-popup software, Internet proxies, javascript being disabled, and a web browser upgrade being required. Conflicts with Anti-Popup Software Although commonly embedded within web browsers and other computer security software today, there are still a number of consumers who download and use anti-popup software. These applications are created in order to eliminate the pop-up windows that launch on visiting some websites. Although pop-up blockers prove beneficial to many end-users, they can cause issues on websites one is trying to view. This results from many of the pop-up blocking technologies  on the market achieving their desired effect by shutting down the Javascript embedded on the targeted webpage. A secondary effect to blocking the pop-up is that the javascript:void(0) error can be thrown if the desired webpage relies on Javascript to work properly. A short-term solution is to turn off your pop-up blocking program. Then, if you want to keep using the application you need to validate the configuration settings for the application. Many of the popular pop-up blocking programs will provide options that allow Javascript to run on the targeted website so you don’t remove all functionality while also avoiding the javascript:void(0) error. Badly Written Javascript Another common cause of the javascript:void(0) error message is incompatible Javascript. This error is more common in legacy code than in that produced today; however, it typically arises from web page authors who do not check their script for compatibility with the various web browsers on the market. If this is the case for the error received on a page surfed to, then an end-user has two options: 1 – Try another web browser when viewing the page, or 2 – Ask the web page author to fix the issue. Unfortunately many page authors will be slow to respond…if they do at all. As a result, the most-proven solution in this case is to use the web browser that the page is designed to support if you are able to install it on your computer. Problems with Internet Proxies Internet proxy servers function as an intermediary between end-users and websites. Since they help create a layer of anonymity between end-users and website, they are highly popular. Unfortunately, they can also interfere with the loading of Javascript on websites an end-user is surfing. Of course, the easiest way to avoid the issue is to just not use a proxy. For many individuals; however, this is either 1 – not possible, or 2 – not preferred. As a result, if you are getting the Javascript:void(0) error while using a proxy, one should locate a different proxy server and attempt the same task. If the error persists, then attempt to find a proxy server which uses a different script than the one you are trying to use. Javascript is Disabled in your Web Browser One of the predominant causes of the javascript:void(0) error is Javascript being disabled in the web browser. This cause is common across web browsers and operating systems. The primary fix is to turn-on Javascript or “enable” it in the web browser. On some computers, you may have to restart the browser or the computer for the change to take effect. The Web Browser Requires Upgrade Many savvy computer users live in fear of upgrading Internet Explorer or other web  browsers due to the software’s past history with not providing “graceful” upgrades to the software.  Besides helping ensure your computer is protected against the latest online security threats, ensuring one’s web browser is upgraded will help minimize the frequency the javascript:void(0) error is encountered. How to Upgrade an Internet Browser Upgrading Internet Explorer Many end-users will not necessarily know if their computer has the most current version of Internet Explorer installed or not. Depending on the frequency that Windows Updates is configured to run on the machine, the web browser may not be the most current version or build available. Step 1 – Ensure you are logged in to your computer with an account that has administrator permissions. Step 2 – Open Internet Explorer by double clicking the program icon located on your computer’s desktop. Step 3 – Select the “Help” menu tab located in the task bar located in the upper, left-hand corner of Internet Explorer. Step 4 – Select the “About Internet Explorer” menu option to display the version and build of the web browser installed on the computer. Note the information that is displayed. Step 5 – Visit the Internet Explorer download page provided by Microsoft. If the version listed on the web page is newer than installed on your computer, click the “Get Internet Explorer XX” link. *Note: XX will be a specific version number of the web browser. Step 6 – De-select the “make Bing and MSN defaults” check box before downloading the upgraded version of Internet Explorer if you do not want to change your computer’s default search engine. Step 7 – Double-click the Internet Explorer installation file once the download completes. If you do not want to make IE the default web browser on your computer, de-select the appropriate menu options when stepping through the installation wizard. Step 8 – Restart your computer after the installation process concludes to complete the upgrade of IE on your computer. How to Install Google Chrome? In the event that Internet Explorer is not fully supporting the website that is throwing the Javascript:void(0) error, Google Chrome is a popular alternative to use in IE’s place. The browser supports several operating systems to include Microsoft Windows, Linux, and OS X. Install Chrome on Microsoft Windows Step 1 – Download the Google Chrome installation file to your computer. If prompted, select the “Save” or the “Run” menu option. Step 2 – If the installation file was saved onto your computer, double-click the file after the download is completed. Chrome will automatically import the browsing history and settings from the computer’s default web browser. Step 3 – If your computer is running Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7, a browser (Chrome) window will launch once setup is complete. On the first launch of the web browser, there will be an option displayed to change the computer’s default search engine if desired. Step 4 – On computers that have Windows 8 installed, there will be a welcome dialogue that is displayed. Choose the “Next” menu button to select the default browser for your computer. If Chrome is selected, it will then display as a Windows 8 app on the computer’s “Start” screen. Install Google Chrome on Linux Google Chrome supports installation on most Linux builds. The recommended method to install the browser is to install Chrome via the native package management system. It can also be copied to a local user directory and executed without administrator permissions. Step 1 – Download the Google Chrome installer file to the computer. Step 2 – Select the “Ok” menu button to open the installation package. Step 3 – Choose the “Install Package” menu option to start installing the program. Step 4 – Google Chrome will launch once the program is setup. The first launch of the program will display information to let the default search engine for the computer to be changed if desired. It will also enable Google search directly from the address bar of the browser. Step 5 – To subsequently open the web browser, choose the “Applications,” “Internet,” and “Google Chrome” menu options. These steps will add the Chrome repository to the Linux package manager to enable updates to the browser. Install Google Chrome on Mac OS X Step 1 – Download the Google Chrome installation file for Mac OS X. Step 2 – Open or launch the file labeled, “Chrome.dmg” after the download is complete. Step 3 – In the subsequently displayed dialogue window, drag the Chrome icon to the Mac OS X “Applications” folder. This action will install Google Chrome for all user accounts on the computer. The browser history and home page settings will be automatically imported from the default we browser on the computer. Step 4 – Launch the Chrome web browser after installation concludes. The Mac OS X “Finder” will request confirmation to open the application from the Web. Select the “Open” menu option to continue with the installation. Step 5 –Choose the “Change” menu option on the Chrome display if you desire to change the default search engine for your computer. Step 6 – Un-mount the Google Chrome disk image on the computer’s desktop by dragging the icon to the “Eject” program icon in the computer’s Dock. Ensure the disk image and not the application icon is drug to the dock. How to Install or Upgrade Mozilla Firefox? Mozilla Firefox is another popular web browser that supports use on multiple operating systems. The browser can be used as an alternative to Internet Explorer or function as an end-user’s primary browser to help avoid or fix the javascript:void(0) error. Once Firefox is installed, it will automatically check for updates to the program. Step 1 – Login to your computer with an account that has administrator permissions. Step 2 – Open your computer’s Internet web browser and visit the Mozilla.com website. Step 3 – Select the “Download Firefox Free” menu option and save the file to your computer. Step 4 – Double-click the installation file once it has completed download to your computer. Step 5 – Accept the default menu prompts displayed by the Mozilla Setup Wizard to proceed through the program installation. Step 6 – Click the “Finish” menu button when setup of the program is complete. Step 7 – Restart your computer. After the computer restarts, launch Mozilla Firefox by double-clicking the program icon located on the machines’ desktop. How to Enable Javascript on Web Browsers? Most Internet browsers provide a mechanism for the end-user to turn Javascript on or off. A common cause of the javascript:void(0) error is the computer’s web browser not having Javascript enabled. Enabling Javascript on Mozilla Firefox Step 1 – Open the Mozilla Firefox browser on the target computer. Step 2 – Select the “Firefox” menu button and choose the “Options” menu choice. Step 3 – Choose the “Content” panel in the “Options” window. Step 4 – Select the “Enable Javascript” menu option to allow client-side Javascript to execute on the target computer.

I cannot follow what I cannot find?  Karl I see an extra window, which I cannot remove, smack dab in the middle, covering up the information I think you mean to convey. How the hell do I get rid of that extra window. Plus, adds keep popping up. I feel like I am in an arcade and the drugs are not helping. This site is too busy to be a help. Rose I have no idea how I’m supposed to ask MyYearbook to fix it since you have to login to talk to the site administrators, I’m trying to press the “Sign in with Facebook” and I can’t login otherwise cuz it only lets you login with Facebook after you sign up with facebook   🙁 JAY JAVA VOID O PROBLEM JAY Thank God I found you! This was driving me NUTS.

Sylvia Haik I get the error message Javascript (0) Void only when I access certain sites that appear to have been recently modified. Guest It’s not an error message… It’s a method to says to the script do nothing. Simple. Source: professional Developer sammeh Thanks for the article. I really do appreciate the fact that you took the time to provide useful information on javascript:void(0) within common browsers that are used today. Thanks for the consideration. Guest BOOOOOYA CodeMonkey3119 If you are writing web applications, the best way to avoid the popup blocker and therefore the void error is to not us browser popups. You can make simulated popups using a combo of css, html, and javascript. For example, WebRocketX is a good example of a framework that relies heavily on this technique. However, it’s not that hard to roll your own solution. You can even make popups upon popups indefinitely like this.

By Team DigitTeam Digit Published Date 19 - Aug - 2016 | Last Updated 19 - Aug - 2016 Tweet   Moto G Plus, 4th Gen (Black, 32 GB) 14999 For a long time, Motorola has behaved as the grizzled veteran of the smartphone industry. It’s quietly launched phone after phone, never really caring to comment on what its opposition is up to. Until now. The new, Lenovo-operated Motorola, seems more aggressive. The company’s US Twitter account has flat out accused Samsung of copying its feature. It’s true, Motorola’s Always On feature came before Samsung’s, and it’s still much better. However, if anyone should get credit for such a feature, it should be Nokia. Remember the Glance screen?   In what galaxy is it okay to steal competitor phones’ cool features? #TheOriginalAlwaysOnDisplay#motozdroidpic.twitter.com/T75byy5bIx — Moto US (@Moto_USA) August 18, 2016   Motorola improved on Nokia’s feature, but Samsung sadly didn’t, settling for an Always On display that’s basically a gimmick. That said, this isn’t the first time an OEM has been “inspired” by something someone else did. Here’s a quick look. Apple  Yes, Apple fans, the Cupertino-based giant is just as guilty as anyone else. Over its past few iterations, iOS has basically been a demonstration of Apple losing its edge with innovation. Here’s how. Live Photos Nokia did this first, with something the company called Living Images, for its Lumia devices. Apple waxed eloquent about how innovative Live Photos were, but the credit really goes to Nokia and Microsoft. Nokia's Living Images (Credit: Windows Blog) Split Screen Split Screen view was introduced by Apple quite recently, but long time smartphone and tablet would give the credit for this one to Samsung. The company brought this to tablets much before Apple. A 12.9 inch iPad and the Apple Pencil The Pen is mightier than the sword, but is the Pencil mightier than the Pen? Apple’s Pencil is just as good as Microsoft’s Surface Pen, but will anyone ever give the credit for this to Apple? Actually, the true credit for smartphone styluses goes to Samsung and its S-Pen. Apple's iPad Pro (L) vs Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 (R) (Credit: Windows Central) Speaking of the Pencil, Apple’s 12.9 inch iPad Pro was a huge nod to Microsoft. The company basically accepted that the Surface was a tablet better suited to replacing the laptop. The Surface remains better, too. Siri Proactive and Apple’s Keyboard shortcuts From Microsoft to Google. Siri has forever been behind Google Now. The only thing Apple’s voice assistant can really boast of, is the fact that it’s a better conversationalist than Google Now. Siri Proactive, announced recently, is basically everything Google Now already has, and the voice recognition itself remains to be seen. While we’re on Siri. Remember the Spotlight Search page that Apple added to the left of the home screen is another effort at providing Google Now. Interestingly, there is little use for the page on an iPhone. Further, the new keyboard shortcuts from Apple, which allow quick insertion of emoticons, pictures etc. have been part of Android keyboard forever. Night Shift Apple’s newest poster boy, Night Shift, is a feature the company has no business taking credit for. It has been available on Android devices for ages, hasn’t it? Lenovo  Lenovo hasn’t been the worst offender, but one of its recent devices perhaps flatters the hell out of Apple. Yes, the Sisley S90 is what we’re talking about. The picture below says a thousand words. Lenovo Sisley S90 (L), Apple iPhone 6 (R) Huawei In many ways, Huawei is the new Samsung. The Chinese telecom giant has quickly made its mark on the smartphone market, and with some impressive devices. It’s not without some inspiration, though. Spotlight Search and Control Center If you’ve ever used a phone running Huawei’s EMUI, you would have seen the Spotlight search like feature. You simply swipe down on any home screen, just like you do on Apple devices. Also, swiping up on the lock screen brings up a menu that looks dangerously like Apple’s Control Center.   Huawei's take on Spotlight Search (L) and Control Center (R) Huawei’s Force Touch Technically, Huawei’s Force Touch-powered phone came to market before Apple’s, but can we really give Huawei the credit for this one? We think not. Not that Force Touch is very useful any way. Xiaomi  There’s a reason Xiaomi doesn’t enter the US market today, and a lot of that has to do with the ‘inspiration’ the company has drawn from Apple. The list can seem never ending here. Mi Message iMessage, Mi Message, what’s the difference really? It’s all about creating an ecosystem of users, a community that uses your phones and other devices. MiUI India first saw MiUI with the Xiaomi Mi 3. MiUI 5 on that device, though, wasn’t as iOS-like. Things changed with MiUI 6, which was almost a replica of iOS at the time, and things haven’t changed much since. Xiaomi has been innovating on its own as well, though. Xiaomi's MiUI 6 launch photos Xiaomi Mi4 launch If you followed the Mi 4 launch, you would remember the image shown below. 'Nuff said! Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun pays tribute to the late Steve Jobs almost every time he takes the stage. Samsung The inspiration game in smartphones was perhaps started by Samsung. The company was in multiple legal battles with Apple, and did pay the company a ton of money for “copying” its designs. The damage was done, though, and no one really cares what Samsung did at one time, especially considering how it leads the market today. Even more recent than the Always On display is Samsung's Iris Scanner for the Note 7. Microsoft added this exact same thing with Windows Hello just a few months ago. The incidents mentioned here are just some instances when such inspiration was drawn. Google's Pixel C tablet has the same story as the iPad Pro, and there are many other instances as well. Let us know if you can add to this list. Team Digit  teamdigit@digit.in All of us are better than one of us.

The feature is in the developer stage, but here's how you can put it into action.  ( François Beaufort | Google+ ) Advertisement Wouldn't things be a lot simpler if we did not have to recollect complicated alphanumeric passwords and could simply unlock our device's screen by merely keying in a few random numbers instead? Google hears you! That's right, the company is working on an experimental feature that allows you to unlock your device's screen by simply inputting a PIN code like you do with your debit or credit card. This PIN must simply be keyed in to the Chrome OS, negating the need for one to type complex passwords. This is no rumor and the news comes straight from the horse's mouth: a Google employee who shared the exciting information in a Google+ post. On Friday, Aug. 19, François Beaufort, who is with Google France, revealed that the experimental feature is being tested as part of the latest developer update for Chrome OS. Beaufort also shared the process on how users could deploy the functionality into their system. For those wondering how to go about unlocking their device's screen with a PIN on Chrome OS, here's a step-by-step guide to help you out. Step 1: Enable the following flag: chrome://flags/#quick-unlock-pin Step 2: Next, restart Chrome. Step 3: Once started, navigate to the settings page for Chrome Material Design. This is required so that you can set up the PIN for the Lock Screen. Step 4: Navigate to the new "Screen Lock" section. Set up the numeric PIN you have chosen for the Lock Screen. Step 5: Make a mental note of your PIN and then press Search button + L simultaneously to lock the screen. Step 6: Key in the PIN, and watch yourself unlock the Chrome OS with a code rather than a password! The experimental functionality is bound to find favor with users of touch devices as it is quite handy. Moreover, inputting a PIN instead of an alphanumeric password is a lot simpler. This is possibly far more secure than deploying an Android phone for the Smart Lock option as Engadget points out. The move is being lauded by Chrome OS fans, but as a user rightly pointed out the PIN functionality could be more expansive. "This is a good move in the right direction. However I think that this pin lock feature should be expanded to also include passwords. So the password is not linked to the Google account but a separate password just for the device," commented the user. Since the feature is still being tested, perhaps Google will enhance it further before the final version is pushed out. Users can also look forward to Quick Unlock settings landing on the regular settings page for Chrome in the near future as revealed by Beaufort. Those keen on more can check the source code out at this link. TAG Chrome OS, PIN code, Passwords © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

Brad Ideas Crazy ideas, inventions and essays from Brad Templeton. Computers, Robocars, Civil Rights, Photography and more. Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Uber buys Otto, folks leave Google, Ford goes big, Tesla dumps MobilEye Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-08-18 15:18. Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own. MobilEye A few weeks ago, MobilEye issued a press release that they would not be supplying the next generation of their EyeQ chips to Tesla. The EyeQ4 is a great deal more sophisticated than the EyeQ3 that Telsa uses, and Tesla even uses an older version with a more limited set of features — including, most famously, the inability to detect things like cross traffic. Since MobilEye announced it, it seems like it was their decision (You don’t usually issue a press release to say you have been dumped by a smaller customer.) It caused their stock to take a quick big hit (Disclaimer, I own a small amount) on the day of the announcement, but it recovered reasonably well. Tesla’s stock was not affected. Tesla folks have always claimed that they only made minimal use of ME’s functionality, and that the real special sauce was theirs. ME folks have claimed the opposite. This break-up will settle that question, and presumably Tesla has been working on alternatives for a while as they don’t seem to be in much panic about it. Tesla has made announcements of plans for their new hardware and those plans look very similar to the EyeQ4, so they must have had their own parallel research underway. » brad's blog Question Submitted by Bill D (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 16:41. Brad, Any thoughts about the MIT / DARPA announcement they might be able to design lidars on a chip to be priced at around $10 each Does that seem feasible to you? Significant? http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mit-li... » reply Solid state Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-08-19 00:24. This project is attempting to do a solid state LIDAR, which is also the goal of Quanergy. Quanergy is much further along, and others hope to do the same thing. The $10 price point is when you are making many millions of the chip, and yes, anything that can go on one chip in those quantities can get a cost that low, though usually you add a few other things beyond the chip. Whether it is this, or Quanergy, or other companies working on it, low cost LIDAR is definitely coming, and will be used on all robocars, I predict, even Tesla (though Elon has sworn otherwise.) Or at least it will until there is some remarkable breakthrough in computer vision. Which is not impossible, but not here yet. I expect the cheap lidars are sooner. But if you have cheap lidar and cheap camera you use both, of course, at least for the first decade. » reply Current cost of lidar Submitted by Bo Nordlin (not verified) on Fri, 2016-08-19 03:13. Brad, I highly appreciate your writing. What are the current cost of lidars in an autonomous vehicle, and what has been the typical yearly price reduction so far? » reply Current cost Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:09. There is no standard LIDAR. Velodyne makes several products ranging from $8,000 to $75,000. Valeo sells a simple 4 plane designed by Ibeo for $250 but it’s not really suitable for self-driving. Quanergy has a $1,000 8 laser unit being tested by some automakers. There are a few other research ones out there. Many companies have this in development, they only just figured it out a while ago. It is reasonable to expect that suitable LIDARs will be under $250, perhaps far under, but you may need more than one. » reply Quanergy et al chip based LiDAR RANGE Submitted by Rutt Bridges (not verified) on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:59. Brad, While I have seen multiple stories about chip-based LiDAR (mostly re: Quanergy), the one thing I haven't see is a spec on range. While the cost-effectiveness of these units could be a real breakthrough for driverless vehicles, if the range is under 100 feet their application will be quite limited. Have you seen or heard any quotes on range? » reply Range Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-08-22 03:25. Range for LIDARs is more a function of their light frequency and eye safety rules. You can’t emit so much power that it would be dangerous to the eye. At that maximum power, you can go about 100m on a dark object and still be seen coming back (against the sun.) You can go further on brighter objects, and most objects are brighter, but you have to focus on that minimum range. » reply More sensitive lidar Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:33. Brad, there's an Israeli company working on more sensitive lidar sensors with a better range. » reply That is true Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:40.

Apple just bought Turi (nee Dato, nee GraphLab). In doing so they acquired the GraphLab Create and Turi Distributed platforms, nice toolkits that accelerate common Machine Learning tasks. However, those don't seem to fit with Apple's product portfolio at all. However they also acquired 50+ data scientists, most with PhDs. To me it looks like perhaps it's an acqui-hire, so they can use those resources on their internal ML projects (cough-self-driving-car-cough). Disclaimer: I'm an evangelist for Turi (i.e. a run a users' group for them, for which I get no cash compensation but do get the occasional perk like a conference ticket). However, I have no special knowledge about their business internals and this is speculation on my part. » reply Tesla & maps Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sat, 2016-08-20 11:22. Hi, have you heard any news on tesla negotiating with a global mapmaker?

Hi Brad Given the pace at which taxi firms are trying to develop autonomous cars and autonomous car developers are increasingly foreseeing a car-on-demand model for the SDC operations, it remains to be seen how car owners/operators will prevent people from misusing the cars - Misusing meaning everything from pure vandalism and dirtying the car to outright car jacking/ using as a self-guided ballistic missile? Would you know if these firms have something in mind to prevent such incidents? » reply Rental cars Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-12 11:12. Are these issues different from the issues with rental cars (Hertz) or carshare (Zipcar)? If they don’t have a wheel, you can’t use them as a missile (unless you physically alter the car, which again you can do with any rental car.) » reply You are right! Autonomous Submitted by Bejoy John (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-16 02:45. You are right! Autonomous cars as missiles seem to be less of a threat. But when it comes to rental cars or car share, at the end of the day, the guy who takes it out has to face the owner of the car when handing it back. That leaves them kind of "obliged" to take care of the car in their custody, which is what prevents people from vandalizing the vehicle. Even a contract to take care of the car is useless if the car owner isn't around to track vandalism and take defaulters to task. Compare that to public toilets where no one is watching you use it and you don't have to face the owner(the govt., public utility cos). So people do not care so much and just use and leave it as they feel. Even facing another user doesn't seem to have the same effect as facing the owner. I see an analog in current business models of autonomous cars - nobody is watching you use it and the car just goes to the next guy who wants to use it. That made me wonder if such consumer behavior is already factored in (but maybe not announced) by autonomous car companies or is it that measures to counter such behavior need to be developed. » reply I have a number of articles on this topic Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-09-16 10:36. Mostly related to the privacy problems because taxi owners will indeed want cameras to stop damage (mostly accidental) to cars as well as people leaving their stuff in them. My current model is as you leave (to stop the meter running) you flip the lever on the camera’s cover, it takes a photo after you are out, and compares it to the photo before you got in, and if there’s a difference, it is examined. In most cases it’s, “You left your bag in the car” but sometimes it’s “You spilled your drink or puked” and the car goes to the car wash and you get the bill. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

It was among the top communications app from tech giant Google. Perhaps, the upcoming Google Allo and Duo can be the best replacement for Hangout on Air. Since things has been changing, and that trend should also be on a mainstream communication tool. Google Hangouts has played a great role in enterprise app for consumers. Basically, Google knows that it’s the time for discontinuing the Hangouts on Air, and get users to YouTube Live, a more immersive and visualizing channel. This journey opens up a new direction for the next Duo and Allo to be in as well. The official confirm on the moving of Google+ to YouTube Live has been publicly announced to be on September 12. It is said that the Hangouts on Air feature is being redirected to YouTube Live, but other features of Showcase, Applause, and Q&A are staying. Notice that users might have to use Google Slides when they need the Q&A section. The company also promised that all of the user contents on Google Hangouts on Air won’t be removed. Users can still find the same content in Activity Log on YouTube Live under the read-only file. Setting up new YouTube Live account process also made easy by following pre-defined steps from Google. So, there is nothing to worry about it then. Google Hangouts on Air not only as simple as messaging app with voice and video calling, it serves consumers as the business tool in those years of operation. For now the next coming Google messaging and communication apps of Allo and Duo will take the roles of messaging and video calling. This could be so far the best expectations from those apps. Google Duo is already launched and users can have it downloaded from Google PlayStore for Android or Apple Store for an iOS version. Thus, this app will have new feature of voice calling to be added. Another time we should add this new app into the list of popular free messaging apps with IMs such as Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Tags: GoogleGoogle hangoutsHangouts On AirYouTube Live Anna Fan Anytime I am not here on AmazinessNet, then you can find me writing in Vietnamese language about tips and tricks to learn real English at HocTiengAnh24H Next story Upcoming Moto Z Play Leaks its White Variant Previous story 4 Android-based Nokia Smartphones Coming In Q4, 2016 You may also like... 0 Weekend Reading: Google Weekly 28 (Oct 3 – Oct 9) 9 Oct, 2016 2 Google Enables The VR View Of Videos And Photos 31 Mar, 2016 2 Google Hangouts for Android Update Version 13.0 Has Custom Chrome Tab 25 Sep, 2016 Follow: Find us on Facebook Find us on Facebook Subscribe to Blog via Email Get Instant News from Amaziness Subscribe Us!

In an early look at the beta version of Google Allo by Android Police, there are quite some good revelations coming out. While it has been discovered that Allo will come with the ability to delete individual messages from a conversation, unlike Hangouts which only allows deleting the entire conversation, there are also an interesting collection of stickers. The use of animated characters has grown along with the growth of messaging apps. Many IMs today come with a collection of inbuilt stickers and apparently, Google Allo has its own packs that look extremely weird, but you’ll definitely enjoy using them. Have you ever thought of sending your pal a sticker of a bull squeezing his nipples or even a condom? Well, this is your day as the upcoming Google Allo has about everything you can ever want. You will come across the likes of Cool Beans and Julio the Bull, just to name but a few stickers, all of which can be used to spice up conversations. These are nothing close to the list of emojis found in Google Hangouts. Since Google Allo is still in the testing stages, these sticker packs are only available on the unfinished version. With this in mind, changes can take place before the official version is released. But it would be unique to have such kind of weird stickers on Allo. It is also possible that some of these stickers may be dropped along the way. Google will be hoping that Allo takes off at least in the same manner as Google Duo did when it was released a few days ago. Apparently, the app is already ahead of Pokémon Go when it comes to the number of downloads in the Google Play Store and it is only bettered by the veteran Facebook Messenger, which is also its closest rival in the video calling business.

Google Allo might feature some ‘controversial’ stickers! TECHNOLOGY 0 0 267 Google announced two new products in May– allo and Duo. The search engine giant expounded that Google allo would be an aI-supported mobile messaging platform while Duo would focus on video calling. at that time, many people thought Google had decided to kill its all-in-one communication app-Hangouts. Just a few days ago, Google released its video calling app Duo which already became the number 1 free app in the Play Store. However, during this year’s Google I/O, the company also announced a new messaging application, allo. allo is expected to be released soon, as information on the app continues to surface online. The latest shows that the application will be coming with a feature that allows users to delete messages from their chat history. Users will be able to select the message and simply delete it from the chat. Google launched their much awaited video calling app, the Google Duo last week. The app had been anticipated for a long while, and was indeed worth the wait. While Google made video calling as simple as it could get with Duo, the markets now await allo. Google had announced two apps back during the Google I/O 2016 – allo and Duo. Just one day before Duo came out, the company had changed the icons of both the apps. Google allo too, is soon expected to release. Recent screenshots leaked via android Police add to the intrigue of this app. These leaked screenshots indicate that Google allo might feature some ‘controversial’ stickers. The screenshots feature images of stickers, which are sexually suggestive in nature. Google’s latest app will come with three pre-installed sticker packs and more can be installed later. Based on the information obtained from the reports, there are 24 sticker packs available. There are a number of controversial stickers in Google allo such as one with the text ‘Send Pics’. This one, when looked closely gives a vibe that the sender is asking for nude pictures. another picture showcases ‘rubber up’, its not hard to guess what its indicating. While these newly introduced stickers on Google allo are indeed funny to some extent, the fact is they are for a slightly more mature audience. However there is a chance Google may pull them down before the app finally releases in the Play Store.

Google is aiming at a direct war with WhatsApp with the arrival of this app. The company announced Allo and Duo messengers during the Google I/O 2016 event. Back then, it was announced that these apps will ‘soon’ release. However, now that Duo is out, Google has really impressed us with their simplicity. The company is soon expected to release their next app, Allo. Based on information obtained via Android Police, it has come to light, that users can delete messages from their chat in Allo. While this seems like a very basic feature which most messengers allow the users to do. The fact is, that Google did not allow this in the past. Be it Google Hangouts or the much beloved Google Talk. The users had no options on deleting an individual message from their conversation. The users did have an option of deleting the entire conversation, but not a single message. This was a something which bothered a number of users. In the present scenario it is considered a very basic feature and many messengers including WhatsApp support it. However, one must keep in mind, that the deleted messages are deleted only from the sender’s device. They still exist on the the receiver’s device. Some apps like Telegram and even Instagram do offer this ability though. As of now there is no option to select multiple messages and delete them together, but it is likely to appear in the final build. Users are also prompted with messages of deleting media from just the chat or entirely from the phone. In addition to this, Google Allo has also been in the news over some of their ‘controversial’ stickers which are sexually suggestive in nature. There is no release date that has been speculated, but it is expected in the coming few weeks.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Google Has Planned To End Support For Chrome Apps On Mac, Windows And Linux By Ali Salman Posted Aug 20, 2016 70Shares Share Tweet Submit Google’s hosted chrome applications run on Google’s browsers through a single manifested file and are generally limited by webpage security restrictions. However, the company’s packaged applications are those which offer similar functionality and have been designed to work on desktops. The latter has the ability to interact with local storage of the machine. Today, Google has announced that it will kill Chrome apps for Macs, Windows and Linux in 2018. Chrome Apps Support To Be Ended On Mac, Windows And Linux Starting Later This Year Google to phase out Chrome apps on desktops means that users will no longer be able to run Chrome apps on any platform except for Chrome OS. Google’s plans start later this year as Chrome apps will only be available to Chrome OS users. Current installed apps will not be affected by this and can still be updated. Moving forward at sometime in the year 2017, the Chrome Web Store will no longer display Chrome apps at any of the above mentioned operating systems. Finally, in 2018, you will not be able to load any of them on Macs, Windows and Linux. As astounding as the deal sounds, the company states that not a huge portion of people are actively using Chrome apps. So generally speaking, not many people will be affected by the change. If you’re worried about Chrome extensions and themes, stay put because they would not be affected. For a while there were certain experiences the web couldn’t provide, such as working offline, sending notifications, and connecting to hardware. We launched Chrome apps three years ago to bridge this gap. Since then, we’ve worked with the web standards community to enable an increasing number of these use cases on the web. Developers can use powerful new APIs such as service worker and web push to build robust Progressive Web Apps that work across multiple browsers Advertisement Nonetheless, one might always question what Google is up to and what future plans does it have for Chrome OS. The company’s justifications leads it to make a real place and need for Chrome apps rather than making them available to the open web. Making Chrome apps available on the web has its own set of limitations like connecting a hardware device or working offline. Google has most certainly patched some of the loopholes and more improvements are on the way. Google Could Be Prepping Two Smartwatches, As Told By These Renders It definitely makes sense for Google to make its apps recognized as a separate entity rather than being in an always-available scenario. This is it for now, folks. Do you think Google is heading towards the right direction by ending its Chrome apps support for Macs, Windows and Linux? Share your thoughts with us in the comments.

In fact, the company is happy to sink its projects if they’re failing to perform, despite how popular they appear to be. Packaged Chrome apps are next on Google’s hitlist, with the announcement yesterday that they’ll be phased out over the next 12-24 months. First, the good news. Apps on Chrome OS will continue to be supported — it’s only the desktop platforms of Windows, Mac and Linux that will be affected. Also, they won’t be dropped immediately. As is common with Google’s other shelved initiatives, the deconstruction will take place over the course of a few years: Starting in late 2016, newly-published Chrome apps will only be available to users on Chrome OS. Existing Chrome apps will remain accessible on all platforms, and developers can continue to update them. In the second half of 2017, the Chrome Web Store will no longer show Chrome apps on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but will continue to surface extensions and themes. In early 2018, users on these platforms will no longer be able to load Chrome apps. From Google’s perspective, axing desktop Chrome apps isn’t coming out of the blue; the company has the stats to back up its decision: As we continue our efforts to simplify Chrome, we believe it’s time to begin the evolution away from the Chrome apps platform. There are two types of Chrome apps: packaged apps and hosted apps. Today, approximately 1% of users on Windows, Mac and Linux actively use Chrome packaged apps, and most hosted apps are already implemented as regular web apps. We will be removing support for packaged and hosted apps from Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Linux over the next two years. I’d like to think it’s also motivated by Google’s new work in the operating system space, but honestly, there’s no point in pouring time into something that services a measly one per cent of users.

Not only is it a departure from what Google has long been invested in doing with Hangouts, but it’s also trying to catch up in one swift release with competing messaging apps that have been around the block for many years and have had time to perfect their approach. So it seems logical that the Allo team got some “inspiration” from other messaging services.

No? Apparently not that many people are, which is why Google will be killing them off for both Mac and Windows in the next few years. Chrome apps are basically apps that run within Google’s Chrome web browser, and some look and act like stand-alone apps. There are a number of apps available, including the likes of Hangouts, Google Keep, an so on. Chrome needs to be running and open in order for these apps to work, even if they seem like standard apps. Related: Google Chrome’s “VR Shell” would let you view any website in virtual reality Google’s decision comes as part of an effort to make Chrome a little simpler. For example, Google removed the app launcher, which allowed users to access Chrome apps, from Chrome in the past few months. Before that, in December 2015, Google removed the notification center from Chrome. Of course, this decision doesn’t mean that Google will get rid of apps on Chrome OS — those will stick around, at least for now. The apps won’t disappear immediately. Google has a plan to get rid of the apps over the next two years. Here’s the timeline for Google Chrome apps: End of 2016: Apps that are newly published won’t be available to Chrome users on Windows, Mac, or Linux. Those apps will only appear for Chrome OS users. Late 2017: Chrome Web Store won’t show Chrome apps for Windows, Mac, or Linux. Early 2018: Chrome apps will stop working on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Google will also give the Chrome Web Store a makeover to emphasis themes and extensions instead of Chrome apps. There are a few reasons the move makes sense. Not only did few people use Chrome apps, but web apps themselves have been getting more popular, too, essentially eliminating the need for apps that run within the Chrome web browser. That’s partly why the process is taking so long — according to a report from VentureBeat, Google wants to ensure that much of the functionality found in Chrome apps is available through web apps first.

As we have the last couple of months now, today we’ll be showing you another 5 Android apps that you should definitely give a shot… Google Duo After its announcement at Google I/O, Google finally released Duo this month. Duo is a 1-on-1 video chat app with a single focus: simplicity. Duo accomplishes that goal by stripping away a lot of the things most video calling apps have but don’t necessarily need. This all starts with the setup. Rather than using a Google account, Duo uses your phone number to sign in and organizes contacts based on their phone numbers. Duo is a one-to-one video calling app for everyone – designed to be simple, reliable and fun so you never miss a moment. Once you’ve set up, Duo launches with the front facing camera turned on, a quick option to start a new call or call a recent contact. From opening the app to getting in a call, you might make 3-5 taps in total, and that’s awesome. Another area where Duo shines is in reliability. Not only does the app adapt to your network speeds, but it will do just about anything to keep a call going. Whether you switch from Wi-Fi to data, or if you’re just in an area with really bad coverage, Duo is going to do everything it can to keep the call connected. Duo also features “Knock Knock” which allows you to easily see who is calling with a live feed of the caller before the call even begins. It only works for those in your address book and can be turned off, but it really does make Duo stand out a bit from the crowd of other services out there today. The app is still in its infancy, so much-needed features such as multi-device support, group calls, and even audio calls aren’t here just yet, although some of those are on the way. Duo is completely free to use and works cross-platform on both Android and iOS. Prisma One of the primary uses we have for our smartphones is photography. With new flagships and even budget devices now packing amazing camera sensors, the quality of the quick snaps we take just keeps getting better. There have been dozens of apps over the years to edit and improve the shots taken with our phones, but one of the more interesting options lately is Prisma. After making its debut on iOS last month, Prisma later made its way to Android with the same core focus: turning average pictures into art. As I mentioned, apps have done this before, so what sets Prisma apart? Rather than relying on your smartphone, Prisma actually uses cloud-computing to analyze your photo, identify objects within it, and then recreate that photo with one of several different “filters” that are available. Prisma transforms your photos into artworks using the styles of famous artists: Munk, Picasso as well as world famous ornaments and patterns. A unique combination of neural networks and artificial intelligence helps you turn memorable moments into timeless art. Depending on the photo you use, Prisma can create some truly stunning shots. If you enjoy smartphone photography, it’s an app I’d definitely recommend checking out. You can pick it up over on Google Play for free.  Weather Mate Another great app we’re featuring this month is Weather Mate. This detailed weather app gives users quick and easy access to just about every detail of the day’s forecast that they may want to know. You can easily see the current weather conditions for your area with added details such as humidity, wind speeds, and the barometric pressure at a glance. Scrolling down you’ll find both extended and hourly forecasts and even more weather details toward the bottom. The app has a very clean and easy interface based on Xiaomi’s Android UI, and I have to say that I quite like it. One of my favorite aspects of this app is its homescreen widget. Where most detailed weather widgets look very cluttered and, well, ugly, this one does not. The transparent background goes well with most wallpapers and it provides a ton of information at a glance. I’d almost say that Weather Mate is worth downloading solely for this widget, but either way it’s completely free on Google Play with no in-app purchases. Iconstructor One of the best aspects of Android is customization. In this very series we’ve highlighted a handful of great customization apps, but Iconstructor takes things to a new level. This app allows anyone who has a bit of patience to create their own custom icon packs in just a matter of minutes. These icons pack are of course based on a set of templates, but using the various options in the app you can make some great looking icons pretty easily. You can even incorporate icon packs that you’ve previously purchased to enhance your design. One word of caution though, don’t use this app to rip off hard working icon pack designers — just have some fun for yourself. Make your own icons! Export individual icons or generate icon packs to be automatically applied to your launcher of choice. Control the color, shape, shadows, icon pack and more of the icons! Add multiple layers to make more complex styles or add an outline for a simple, minimal icon pack. Iconstructor is available for free on Google Play, however to get the full experience you’ll want to pick up the $2.49 pro version. InsWall Keeping with the theme of customization, let’s finish off the month with a wallpaper app. InsWall is free app full of great, photography-based wallpapers. As a fan of these kinds of wallpapers on my setup, I really enjoyed looking through the various options found within InsWall. Along with all the awesome wallpapers, InsWall also features a clean, Material Design inspired UI and no in-app purchases. You can of course support the developers if you choose to do so, but it isn’t a requirement to get everything out of the app. Experience the world of customization with over 175 beautiful wallpapers. Make your creativity fly and enjoy the broad content of InsWall. InsWall is available now on Google Play for free. If you’re not a fan of these photography style wallpapers, I’d also recommend checking out Backdrops, also free on Google Play. Have suggestions for what apps we should feature next month?

Google Capital is a separate entity from Google Fiber, and it specializes in later-stage investments. This deal appears to be more about combining two regional overbuilders into a top 10 US cable company that should put the heat on incumbent MSOs. And it’s also further evidence of private equity’s interest in smaller operators. Private equity firm TPG will pay Abry Partners $2.25bln—$1.6bln for RCN and $650mln for Grande—and combine the providers. However, both will continue to operate under their respective names, which already have established clout in the marketplace. There also won’t be a big change in management, with TPG partnering with Patriot Media, which currently manages both RCN and Grande. Patriot is headed by Steve Simmons and Jim Holanda. Abry bought Grande in 2009 when it also owned Atlantic Broadband, whose existing management team added management of Grande. When Abry bought RCN a year later for $1.2bln, Patriot was brought in to manage the overbuilder. Atlantic Broadband was sold to Cogeco in 2012, opening the door for Patriot to take over management of Grande in 2013. While Abry could have combined the two like TPG is doing, given the different geographies (RCN has subs in NY, DC and Boston, while Grande’s customer base is in TX) and uncertainty in the M&A space, it probably made sense to keep them separate to preserve their options. The deal is expected to close in 1Q17. It would be wise to pay close attention to TPG’s statement on the purchase, which focuses on HSD. “The way that content is distributed and consumed has evolved significantly in ways that create an overwhelming demand for affordable, high-speed cable networks. There is an unprecedented amount of diverse, creative content being produced that is extremely bandwidth intensive,” David Trujillo, partner at TPG, said in a statement. “High-speed data has become, and will remain, the essential connection for both consumers and businesses. Both RCN and Grande are proven leaders in providing fast, affordable, and reliable data services.” Grande is at the top of Netflix’s ISP speed index for July, with RCN also ranking above several large incumbents. And just last week, RCN was named PC Magazine’s Readers’ Choice for best ISP for the 2nd year in a row. The added financial support of TPG given the overbuilders’ offerings could help to accelerate OTT launches by incumbents. RCN offers both Hulu and Netflix content as a channel through its DVR powered by TiVo. TPG was advised on the transaction by PJT Partners, UBS, Cleary Gottlieb, and Deloitte. Abry, Patriot Media, RCN, and Grande were advised by C redit Suisse, Kirkland & Ellis, Locke Lord and PwC. share this article previous storyFox Executive Shuffle next storyBack to School with Low-Cost Broadband Join The Discussion Featured Stories <   > Featured Stories Screenster Sling Does Black Friday Distribution DirecTV Now Regulation Retrans Rhumba Programming Most Powerful Women 2016 Distribution Comcast Usage Plan Distribution 50 for VCTA Related Stories Distribution 5 Questions: ZoneTV’s Jeff Weber… Distribution Sling Does Black Friday Distribution Fox on DirecTV Now The Latest Distribution Washington Update: FCC Transition Team… Distribution 5 Questions: ZoneTV’s Jeff Weber… Distribution Washington Action: House OKs Bill… Distribution NBA + Discovery = Math… Distribution Comings & Goings Distribution Wisdom at Cablefax’s Most Powerful… Distribution Lost & Found Distribution FCC Meeting: Wheeler Addresses Deleted… Distribution Now What?

Date: 2016-08-21Author: kopitiambot (Source: kotaku.com) Not pictured: Me One of the biggest scandals to hit the 2016 Google Doodle Fruit Games was the realization that I can’t ride a tricycle. But it’s far from the only one. My career as a Fruitlympian is over. The 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio are coming to a close, after two weeks of the world’s best athletes showing the rest of us that we’re plebs, as well as delicious scandals. And during that time, the Google Doodle folks hosted their latest time wasters: The 2016 Doodle Fruit Games—simple mobile app games, which have shown me that my reaction times are that of a pleb, as well as giving a peek into a weird fruit dystopia. Or something… My account of the seven available events are as follows: Event 1: The Strawberry Sprint Game Was A Death Trap Disguised As Fun In this event, Google overestimated my left and right screen tapping abilities. Scattered on the ground were speed up pads—I was supposed to touch those, I think. Google also thought I needed a little incentive by allowing a watermelon into the competition. One of the other fruits got squashed by it because I cut him off. Harsh. That was my first clue that the Fruit Games were not all they seemed. I ran the races at least two more times, and every time I finished in second place. At least I never got squashed by that terror, the Watermelon. Hunger Game Fans, I have a question: what usually happens to runner-ups? Best Score: 25.6 secs Event 2: Pineapple Tennis Ended In Tears And Straight Up Murder Now here is a game I was actually decent at. Timed taps volleyed the tennis ball back and forth between my opponents and me. I slaughtered them—and then stood on the bodies of my competitors. Oh. Well, that smarmy Dragon Fruit deserved it, anyway. No regrets. Best score: 33 Event 3: Grape Hurdles Sent Me To The Hospital I didn’t like this one. Not. one. bit. Hurdle jumping isn’t as easy as touching the screen and swiping your finger! Oh…well, according to this Google game, it is. I got two stars out of three, and many buzzer sounds every time I barreled through the hurdles. Whatever. Best score: 28 Event 4: Lemon Pool Shenanigans Questioned Everything In The World There was something very wrong with this “pool”. Ice cubes, rubber duckies, and crossbones obstacles were all up in the water. Tilting the phone to avoid them wasn’t so bad. Hitting the ice was a terrible ordeal, but I suppose the pool situation could have been worse. Best score: 67m Event 5: Blueberry Golf Wasn’t At All Like Golf (Not That I Would Actually Know) This event required skillfully tilting the phone to quickly move the blueberry “golf ball” into three sections of a golf course. It’s a bit like those wooden puzzle games where you tilt it to move the tiny silver balls into holes. I was not so skillful. Perhaps more disturbing is that the golfer is an orange. That blueberry needs to stand up for itself. Best score: 65s Event 6: All The Years of Going Apple Picking and Kicking Them, Finally Paid Off This was another event of fruit on fruit violence, as it’s your job as an apple to toss grapes repeatedly into a net. It’s so fun though, that who cares really? Aiming and flicking fingers across the touchscreen is how this event is played, and I did wonderfully. At least I felt I did. A winner is me. Best score: 21 Event 7: Coconut BMX Can Crawl Into A Hole And Die Ugh. This game. The one with the tricycle riding coconut. No matter how many tricks I tried to apply, I never got more than one star in this event. Maybe it was the squeaky tricycle chain that distracted me, as a reminder of that time I almost got killed by a dog when I was riding my own tricycle as a child. Yeah. Let’s go with that excuse for my incompetence at pressing the touchscreen and my poorly timed releases. Best score: 1686 And now for a display of my collective shame, for your viewing pleasure: Can’t wait to see how I fail in 2020. All images via screencap.

However, as the open web grew and matured, the need for these apps diminished, and now Google will soon be killing them off entirely.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google has announced that it will gradually phase out support for Chrome web apps on Windows, Mac and Linux - a move that comes as the company struggles to find a new niche after the apps, which offered unique functions that the open web couldn't provide at the time the apps were conceived, have become mainstream. "For a while there were certain experiences the web couldn't provide, such as working offline, sending notifications and connecting to hardware," the company said as part of its justification for the decision. Around 2013, Google introduced Chrome web apps in order to address a lingering problem that Chrome OS was a victim of: a lack of apps. At the time, this was actually the greatest weakness of the Chrome OS. Chromebooks were already rather successful because of their low cost and how easy they were to manage, and they have since gone on to find high adoption rates in corporate and educational settings. Google sought to fix Chrome's final problem by allowing developers to create web apps that functioned similarly to traditional stand-alone apps. The appeal was that these apps would be universal, and did not require any extra effort from developers to make them compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux computers, since users on those platforms could simply access the apps through the Chrome browser. The end result? Users got apps that simulated smaller apps in their own dedicated window, offering a range of apps such as Google Keep, Hangouts and Wunderlist on non-Chrome OS computers. While a solid idea, unfortunately, it didn't entirely pan out. Why? They aren't really needed anymore. In a blog post, Google stated that there are two types of Chrome apps: packaged apps and hosted apps. Currently, roughly 1 percent of users on Windows, Mac and Linux actively use Chrome-packaged apps. Meanwhile, most hosted apps are already implemented as regular web apps. As a result, the tech company will focus on improving Chrome and gradually phase out the apps on every other system over the next few years, before killing it off entirely. By the end of 2016, any new Chrome apps that are published will only be available to Chrome OS users, though existing apps can continue to be updated. By mid-2017, Windows, Mac and Linux users won't be able to see Chrome apps in the Chrome Web Store. And in early 2018, Chrome apps won't function on those platforms anymore. The company said that Chrome apps will continue to be supported and maintained on Chrome OS "for the foreseeable future," but considering that the Play Store is coming to Chrome OS and Chrome apps are being killed off on every other platform, that future doesn't look like it will be a particularly long one.

Google announced yesterday plans to slowly phase out Chrome apps on all platforms by early 2018. Good news is all the apps will continue to be supported on the company’s own platform, Chrome OS. The move appears to be to force users, who have pledged loyalty to Windows, Mac, or Linux, to join its platform. According to the company’s plans, starting later this year, users on other platforms will not be able to download new Chrome apps. Existing apps, however, will remain available and updated on all platforms, which include Windows, Mac, and Linux. Then, sometime in 2017, the company’s Web Store will stop displaying them on all other platforms. By early 2018, the search engine giant plans to completely kill the support of the apps on other platforms. Chrome apps are web-based applications that run on Google’s main browser. The main purpose for the company offering apps on other platforms was due to certain experiences the web platform could not offer, such as working offline. According to the company, these loopholes have been patched. "Developers who can’t fully move their apps to the web can help us prioritize new APIs to help fill the gaps left by Chrome apps." There are two types of Chrome apps. Hosted apps are installed on the company’s web platform, while Packaged Apps are traditional apps you find on Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store. The phase-out has given developers a year-and-a-half to migrate their apps to Chrome’s platform. Additionally, the company is also providing developers tools to help with the migration. The news of Google killing support of its apps on other platforms isn’t really unexpected. In December 2015, it was reported that the company had removed its notification center from its browser. In July of the same year, the Chrome app launcher was removed from the browsers on all other platforms. It seems the company had initially planned to make apps harder to access and then direct the users toward its own operating system. Several tech experts believe that forcing developers to migrate their apps from top operating systems might cause them to lose interest in creating apps for Chromes OS. Perhaps to counter that, Google recently announced plans to add support of Android apps on Chrome computers.

Thus, by 2018, users of the said platforms will not be able to load any of the Chrome apps that are still available for them to access at present. Silently dropping the bombshell on its Chromium blog on Friday, Google explained that the removal of the Chrome apps will be gradual, such that existing Chrome apps will continue to work on the platforms by the end of this year, while new apps will only be available to Chrome OS users. By 2017, Chrome apps will no longer appear on the Chrome Web Store on the three platforms, and by 2018, users of the three platforms will not be able to load the apps.  Though this may come as a surprise to Mac, Windows and Linux users who utilize Chrome apps, this will not be shocking to many since Google has explained that the reason behind this move is actually the poor reception of the apps among Mac, Windows and Linux users. To be exact, only one percent of users of the three platforms actively use Chrome’s packaged apps or its fully functional applications.  Related Stories Is Google Replacing Chrome OS, Android With Fuchsia? However, Google is not just removing packaged apps. Hosted apps or applications that are accessible through the web are also affected by this move. Because of this, developers can only work on Chrome apps for Chrome OS in the near future. Google even encouraged developers in the blog post to start migrating their Chrome apps to the web.  Scrapping Chrome apps for other platforms is a bit risky, since PC World sees this as a threat that could discourage developers from building apps for the Chrome OS. The only consolation on the developers' part is that Google announced months prior that Android apps will soon be compatible with Chrome OS computers, and this could encourage Chrome apps developers to also try their hand at making Android apps and perhaps focus on this in the near future.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

The five Android N developer previews gave us a great look at future Android 7.0 Nougat features. Of course, developer previews quite often contain features that don’t make it to the final release and there’s plenty more stuff that Google might have added since the last developer preview. Based on the various previews, public statements and credible leaks, we have compiled most of the Android 7.0 features you can expect to see in the next Android version. Quick Settings toggle behavior fixed The familiar toggle on/off action for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in the Quick Settings was removed. In its place, tapping the toggles launched the menu screen for each setting. This, naturally, infuriated Android users everywhere to such a frightening degree that Google fix it. Cat-catching Easter Egg This is the most fun thing. The Android N Easter Egg is a peculiar cat-catching game based on pre-Pokémon GO-era cat-catching game Neko Atsume (Neko meaning “cat” in Japanese). The premise is simple: lay out treats for cats, who will intermittently drop by (in your notifications) for a feed. “Catch” them and share with your friends. App source now shown in App info While the functionality has been laying dormant in Android for a long time, dev preview 5 now surfaces the source information for apps. This means that when you tap App Info for a particular app, the OS will display whether it was installed via the Play Store or side-loaded/sourced from a third-party site like Amazon. The feature is likely just there to help technicians or developers diagnose potentially problematic apps sourced from outside Google Play. New Google Camera with customizable volume button actions The new Google Camera 4.1 comes pre-loaded on Android N dev preview 5 and it adds a couple of nice new features. First up, csutomizable volume key actions. This means you can tell the Android OS what you want volume up and down to do while in Google Camera. Choose from zoom, shutter and volume for now. The three on-screen settings – timer, HDR and flash – now show their options in a full-width view. When accessing previously taken photos, the Google Photos icon has been replaced with an “All Photos” label in the top right hand corner and you can now double tap to zoom in instantly. The three on-screen settings – timer, HDR and flash – now show their options in a full-width view. When accessing previously taken photos, the Google Photos icon has been replaced with an “All Photos” label in the top right hand corner and you can now double tap to zoom in instantly. You can no longer display manual exposure settings. This year, rather than wait until Google I/O 2016, Google decided to release the first Android N developer preview on March 9, two full months earlier than expected. The Android N preview went live for the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 9 (Wi-Fi and LTE), Nexus Player and Pixel C on the Android Developers site. New Quick Settings options for developers This one is likely to vanish before the final Android 7.0 build rolls out, but for now, there are two new options in the Edit menu of the Quick Settings. “Show layout bounds” and “Profile GPU rendering” both now appear as optional tiles. VR mode options now appear in Display Settings The setting is now showing up in the Display settings in dev preview 5. At the bottom there is now a setting called “When device is in VR mode” with options for “use low motion blur settings” and “do nothing”. A teardown will soon reveal further VR mode integration. Camera twist gesture added If you’re a fan of the funky wrist twist gesture to launch the camera in certain Motorola devices, you’ll be pleased to know the same function was added to the final Nougat feature. Custom Pointer and other final APIs The fourth Dev Preview contains the final Android 7.0 APIs and SDK. One of those final APIs is the Custom Pointer API, which will be utilized by devs to get their apps ready for keyboard and mouse control, essential for Android apps on Chrome OS. API 24 is the new target for developers and they are now able to publish apps supporting API 24 to Google Play in the alpha, beta and production release channels. Android Auto navigation is broken This is hardly a feature, but it has cropped up enough on the Android bug tracker to warrant the attention of the Android team. Remember, Android N is a developer release, so things occasionally get broken. You can rest assured it will be working again by the time your devices get the official Android 7.0 update though. The 2016 Nexus devices For sure Sailfish and Marlin/the Nexus 6P (2016) and Nexus 5X (2016) – or whatever they will be called this year – will be arriving on the same date as Nougat but it seems unlikely considering the lack of concrete leaks. It’s more likely that the 2016 Nexuses, both of which will be made by HTC, will come a little later than Nougat, but probably still earlier than in previous years. We might see this year’s Nexuses earlier in September rather than the end of the month if the progressively earlier announcement dates are anything to go by. There has been a steady stream of pre-release leaks regarding Android Nougat and the new Nexuses. Some of the leaks you may have seen recently will likely be Nexus-only features and not be common to all devices running Android Nougat. Google has already spoken about offering special software features only on the Nexuses in what we can only imagine is Google’s idea of actually “promoting” its device line. Some of those features include navigation control via fingerprint scanner gestures, new Google Assistant features.   TAGS Android Android N Google Mobile Industry Operating Systems Editor RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Emirates and Google to promote reading in Arabic Google Assistant aims to upstage Siri and Alexa Global Mobile Trends Report: Industry Shift to Asia, Rise of the Mobile Internet Meet Google Duo, a simple 1-to-1 video calling app Go bananas for the 2016 Doodle Fruit Games How to get the Windows 10 Anniversary Update Launch of Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund – Call for Applications from Start-Ups New additions to the Android TV and Google Cast family Is your Android smartphone malware infected to net a $300,000 monthly paycheck As expected, Android apps on Chromebook launch with bugs Apple shows off iOS 10 and MacOS Sierra; Siri, Apple Maps, and Apple Music revamped The Android Update: the N-Release, Virtual Reality, Android Studio 2.2 and more 1 COMMENT Joseph August 31, 2016 at 12:44 pm Any update on the release date??

There’s now a third option: a simple personal identification number. In a recent Google + post, Google developer François Beaufort outlined how to use the feature: All you have to do is enable the flag chrome://flags/#quick-unlock-pin, restart Chrome, and go to Chrome Material Design settings page for now to set up your Lock Screen PIN in the new "Screen Lock" section. When it's done, lock your screen with + L and enjoy the new unlock experience! He noted that the feature is still experimental, but that it should make things slightly easier for users. According to OMG! Chrome, the feature is part of the latest Canary Build for the operating system, and it will allow users to input a four-digit PIN rather than their entire Google account password. This is only used for the lock screen and won’t replace the initial login to start up your computer. If you have a long, complicated password, this would make it easier to get back to work.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Glass fans, including author Mike Elgan, thought Google Glass would change the world. And it looks like it will. More like this Finally: Smart glasses that don't look dumb Google Glass mysteries revealed! Why I'm still excited about Google Glass Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware The single most innovative wearable of all time has to be Google Glass. Yeah, I said it. And it's true. If you read the tech blogs, you'd be forgiven for believing that Google Glass is a failed product, dead and gone. But in fact, the opposite is true. The Google Glass Explorer program succeeded wildly. Google is feverishly working on new kinds of Google Glass products, and the innovation around Google Glass never stopped. Wait, what was Google Glass again? On April 15, 2013, Google launched its Explorer program for Google Glass. It was a kind of unique beta program set up not only to test the product but also to find out what people might do with it. The smart glasses cost $1,500. (Some, including me, believed that the high price was in part to keep away casual, nonserious users. High cost was a feature, not a bug.) For most of the Explorer program, Google Glass was available by invitation only. While Google Glass was slammed for being unpopular, Google had, in fact, worked hard to keep the number of users small. Google Glass runs on an operating system called Glass OS, and most of the components inside are similar or identical to smartphone parts. Glass has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of flash storage, plus a camera, a microphone, an accelerometer, a gyroscope and an ambient light sensor. But Google Glass also has unique parts, like a 640-×-360-pixel prism projector that beams the screen into the wearer's right eye. A touchpad on the right side enables gesture control, and you can take 5-megapixel pictures by winking. It also captures video. On Jan. 15, 2015, Google announced that it would end the Explorer program and move the Glass operation from the Google X lab into a product development group. This transition from research beta to product development was falsely reported as a "failure." (Greenlighting a research program as a full-blown product line does not suggest failure. And a product that has not shipped yet cannot be called a failure.) Google is even still actively providing free tech support to Google Glass users. Google! Providing tech support! In fact, Google Glass is one of the most exciting pre-products in the history of technology. Even the discontinued test version is the foundation of multiple revolutions in science and industry. The actual Google Glass products will probably dominate the future of wearables. Forget the tech press's false narrative around Google Glass. Here's what's happening with one of the most revolutionary products ever. What people are using Google Glass for right now Airplane and aerospace giant Boeing is using Google Glass to help the people who make airplanes. Glass solved a problem that Boeing had for years, which is how to streamline the connection of aircraft wire harnesses, a process that normally required massive amounts of paperwork. Now, airplane assembly workers get needed information hands-free using Glass's voice-activation feature while they use their hands to do the actual construction. Boeing is also looking into the use of Google Glass on the International Space Station. Doctors and surgeons of all kinds are using Google Glass to record procedures, access medical information hands-free and consult with specialists. Glass is so popular in the medical community that a San Francisco-based digital health startup called Augmedix is offering a Glass-based medical note-taking service for use while examining a patient. The company claims that hundreds of doctors are using the service. Stanford University is reportedly conducting groundbreaking research into helping people with autism read others' emotions using Google Glass. Called the Autism Glass Project, the study is testing a special Google Glass app with children ranging in age from 6 to 17. The app uses facial recognition software to identify the emotions expressed on other people's faces, and then tells the test subject what emotion is being expressed. The idea is to use the Glassware (Google Glass software) to train people with autism so that over time they can identify emotions on their own, without Glass. Study participants also learned to look at people's faces more often and make more eye contact. In England, researchers at Newcastle University have been studying multiple ways in which Google Glass might help sufferers of Parkinson's disease cope better, from improving their walking to helping them understand when they're not speaking loudly enough. Google Glass is being used in one of the world's most successful efforts to stop rhinoceros poaching. The people involved in the project, which is taking place in Chitwan National Park in Nepal, are using a combination of dogs, drones and Google Glass as part of a comprehensive effort to stop poachers and study rhinos. These are just a few of the ways even the beta version of Google Glass is being used to change the world. Just wait until Google Glass actually ships! What we know about Google's plans for the future of Google Glass Google is working on a Glass Enterprise Edition for business and industrial use. The Enterprise Edition is similar to the Explorer edition from the beta program, but the eyewear has hinges, so the Glass hardware can be folded like regular glasses. It also has a different kind of connector that has been compared to Apple's MagSafe technology. It also has a prism unit that presumably shows a larger screen than the beta version. A prototype of the Explorer edition even showed up on eBay earlier this year. It was being sold by a San Francisco pawn shop. It's a no-brainer that companies will use Google Glass and other smart eyewear technologies -- even some Glass critics acknowledge that. But Glass is also coming to the consumer market. A couple of years ago, Google and Italian glasses giant Luxottica announced a partnership to develop Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses using Google Glass technology. When the first commercial Google Glass headsets ship, we can expect sunglasses from these companies as well. (Neither Google nor Luxottica immediately replied to my request for details on the current state of the partnership.) Patents don't always reveal what types of products companies will actually ship, but Google's many Glass patents suggest ideas and directions. Last week, a new patent emerged showing a future version of Google Glass with some new features. One is the option to use standard rechargeable or disposable batteries -- AAA, AA or 9-volt. This would be valuable for people using Glass far away from electrical outlets, or without the time to charge between uses. The battery options sound to me like a stopgap to solve the problem of Glass's short battery life until better battery technology can be developed. The same patent also shows a redesigned headset that may be more comfortable to wear. This is only the latest of many Google Glass patents that have emerged since the Explorer program. How Google Glass has influenced technology With its Glass initiative, Google pioneered and popularized the use of smart glasses, and the effort is now having an impact in other markets. The U.S. women's track cyclists won a silver medal at the Rio Olympics. One of their advantages was Google Glass-like Solos smart cycling glasses, which they used for training. The special sunglasses feature heads-up displays that provide real-time stats, so the cyclists can track their performances without taking their eyes off the road. Heads-up displays that work similar to the Google Glass version are coming out for all kinds of sports, including skiing and scuba diving. The consumer market will be affected as well. One of the best uses of Google Glass was the camera, which you could activate with a button, a touchpad or a voice command, or by simply winking your eye. A product now being crowdfunded in Japan called the Blincam emulates that feature. The Blincam itself is a camera that clips on the side of a pair of regular glasses or sunglasses. When it detects a blink, it takes a picture, then uploads it to your phone via Bluetooth. The company plans to demo the product for the first time at TechCrunch Disrupt in September and sell it on Amazon and elsewhere next year. I believe the experiential live video trend I talked about recently in this space will drive huge demand for eye-level cameras, including consumer versions of Google Glass as well as copycat products. When the Pokémon Go craze hit last month, I heard a lot of chatter about how great it would be to play Pokémon Go with Google Glass. And so it would. More to the point, Pokémon Go is popularizing and mainstreaming mixed reality. This makes the consumer world safe for Google Glass again. Although Hololens and Magic Leap will no doubt provide a much higher-resolution experience for mixed reality, the arrival of these products in mobile versions at affordable prices is many years in the future. The bottom line is that the Glassholes were right and the naysayers were wrong. Google Glass is already changing the world. And it hasn't even shipped yet.

What are the top 10 most popular search engines? 09 Aug 16 | Author Christopher Ratcliff | Search Search Marketing SEO Stats Tweet You know, apart from the most obvious search engine. And possibly the second most obvious one too. In fact I’ll start again, what are the eight most popular search engines after Google and Bing? The first list below contains the most popular search engines currently available, ordered by most to least popular in the US. The ranking is according to eBiz, it’s in order of estimated unique monthly visitors and is accurate as of August 2016. The second list is a global overview of most popular search engines, according to Net Market Share, which is ranked in order of market share and is again accurate as of August 2016. As opposed to our previous list of search engine alternatives to Google, this list will concentrate purely on informational searches rather than say… Gifs or copyright free images. US 1) Google Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 1.6 billion Alexa Rank: 1 Why should you use it? With 72.48% of the world’s market share of search, as a marketer you don’t really have a choice not to use it for both paid and organic reach. As an every day user, for all of our cynicism and occasionally flippant references to The Circle, you have to admit Google is utterly indispensable in your every day life. For every interference (the constant curtailing of organic results) there are 10 triumphs… Google Maps, Gmail, the terrifying relevance of Knowledge Graph, the killing of payday loan ads, AMP… Where the heck would we all be without the… yes, I’m going to say it… search giant. 2) Bing Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 400 million Alexa Rank: 22 Why should you use it? As I said in earlier in the year in the aforementioned ‘alternatives to Google’ post, there are some great reasons to choose Bing: Bing’s video search is significantly better than Google’s. Bing often gives twice as many autocomplete suggestions than Google does. Bing has a great linkfromdomain:[site name] feature that highlights the best ranked outgoing links from that site, helping you figure out which other sites your chosen site links to the most. 3) Yahoo Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 300 million Alexa Rank: n/a Why should you use it? Well that’s all a but up in the air at the moment, as Verizon has just purchased Yahoo for $4.8 billion dollars and is planning on merging it with AoL. Yahoo will continue to operate independently pending regulatory approval of the deal, which is expected to be completed by early 2017. After this, all of Yahoo’s news, finance and sports platforms will be added to AOL’s media assets, which include The Huffington Post and TechCrunch. 4) Ask Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 245 million Alexa Rank: 31 Why should you use it? Despite Google’s determination to be the ultimate font of all knowledge on its own SERP, Ask is still good for specific question related searches, with results centring on Q&A related matches. And hey, sometimes it’s nice to get help from a butler. 5) Aol Search Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 125 million Alexa Rank: n/a Why should you use it? As mentioned above, the AOL you know and possibly love may become a different beast once Verizon Communications merges it with Yahoo. Let’s remember simpler times… 6) Wow Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 100 million Alexa Rank: 767 Why should you use it? Because it works more like a news site then a search engine, which is handy if you want everything in one place. There is a strong lean towards news and celebrity based articles rather than pure Wikipedia-style information, but the handy links to related social channels and wiki pages are useful. 7) WebCrawler Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 65 million Alexa Rank: 674 Why should you use it? WebCrawler has a far clearer delineation between paid search ads and organic results. It also seems to feature far more natural ’blue links’ than Google. 8) MyWebSearch Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 60 million Alexa Rank: 405 Why should you use it? Uh… don’t. According to the Malware Wikia, MyWebSearch is a spyware and search toolbar program that allows the user to query various popular search engines and comes bundled with an exhausting suite of ‘goodies’ such as such as Smiley Central, Webfetti, Cursor Mania, My Mail Stationary, My Mail Signature, My Mail Stamps, FunBuddyIcons… the fun goes on and on. Most damningly of all though, Malware Wikia reports that despite it not carrying any malware attributes, an independent repair lab has classified the toolbar as a nuisance because of “slowdowns in return for features that are already built into many modern web browsers.” 9) Infospace Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 24 million Alexa Rank: 2,110 Why should you use it? You may be using it already… InfoSpace is a “provider of white label search and monetization solutions” and it also operates its own branded search sites, including the metasearch engine Dogpile, as well as Zoo.com and WebCrawler (as mentioned above.) 10) Info.com Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 13.5 million Alexa Rank: 1,938 Why should you use it? Info.com aggregates results from the indexed web AND social media channels. It monitors real-time social conversations and according to them, it delivers “newsworthy, trending, and popular results before they hit the indexed web.” These streams are classified into structured topics which provides additional context and insight. Bonus: 11) DuckDuckGo Honourable mention to DuckDuckGo, the new kid on the block that doesn’t store your personal information, which has managed to accrue 13 million unique monthly visitors and is currently the 11th most popular search engine in the US. Worldwide Here’s the marketshare worldwide for search engines… 1) Google – 72.48% 2) Bing – 10.39% 3) Yahoo – 7.78% 4) Baidu – 7.14% 5) Ask – 0.22% 6) AOL – 0.15% 7) Excite – 0.01% Christopher Ratcliff is the editor of Search Engine Watch and a writer at ClickZ.

While AMP is not a ranking signal, at least not yet, this announcement is a milestone for the initiative that Google launched earlier this year in an effort to speed the mobile web. The search giant’s desire to make mobile web pages load faster is obvious: slow, clunky pages that don’t provide a good user experience threaten Google’s mobile ad business. AMP, which is an open standard that consists of slimmed-down HTML and JavaScript, aims to make it possible for publishers to more easily create performant mobile experiences. But for all of AMP’s virtues, websites that have adopted AMP may not be benefiting from the introduction of their AMP pages into Google’s organic mobile search results. In fact, they could be seeing less traffic. As Barry Schwartz of Search Engine Roundtable detailed, he’s seen a lower CTR from AMP pages. Glenn Gabe of G-Squared Interactive speculates that lower CTRs for AMP results could be due to the fact that users don’t know what AMP is, making the AMP icon and text that appears alongside AMP results a CTR killer: Looking back the demo and seeing both AMP icons + mobile-friendly tags, I couldn’t help but think that the average user might understand mobile-friendly way more than AMP with a lightning bolt. And if that’s the case, wouldn’t that yield mediocre results for amplified pages in the search results (at least in the short-term)? And couldn’t that possibly lead to even more click through to mobile-friendly pages versus amplified pages? In an effort to test his hypothesis, Gabe created a quick poll that asked respondents if they knew what AMP referred to, and whether they’re be more likely to click on an “AMP” or “mobile-friendly” search result. Not so surprisingly, only three of the 44 people who responded to the poll knew what AMP was, and only two indicated they’d be more likely to click on an “AMP” result compared to 29 who preferred “mobile-friendly.” While a poll of 44 people is far from scientific, Gabe’s logic – that average consumers who aren’t involved with web development and SEO aren’t likely to know what AMP is – seems sound and raises questions about how Google will educate the public about what AMP is and what benefits it offers. The good news is that Google is almost certainly collecting data about its new AMP results and is likely to take action if it notices lower CTRs across the board for these results. In the meantime, early AMP adopters experiencing lower CTRs have a not so pleasant reminder that being an early adopter can sometimes be a double-edged sword.

With Barrett pulling the strings they were strong, fast and ruthless and Australia’s team, loaded with veterans, looked so far off the pace as to need pacemakers. It seems safe to say Michael Cheika’s selections backfired, though he wasn’t helped by a string of injuries to the outside backs, including the luckless Giteau. If that hotel room was bugged by the Australians (which isn’t to say it was, in fact it seems ludicrous) it wasn’t worth it. Thanks for your company and emails tonight. I’m out. Have a good night.

Here’s NZ captain Kieran Read: “We were still finding it tough out there [sounds like a white lie to me] but our performance was outstanding. The boys certainly worked for it.” The execution let them down in the second half, he says, and they’ll look to improve next week. Improve?! Next week?! Yes, the Wallabies head to Wellington next week before playing at Eden Park in October. Stephen Moore now: “Hard to know what to say, I feel for all the fans who came here tonight. We prepared well and trained hard and thought we were ready to play well tonight. We’ve got to keep going and get ready for next week over there. “We need to be positive.

But there are more wings to pull off the fly so they pack a scrum 5m out from Australia’s line. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.56am EDT 07:56 80 min: Is that another try to New Zealand? We’ve gone to the video ref. After what may have been a NZ knock on, Barrett, in midfield, measured a perfect crossfield kick into the arms of Dagg just inside the right touchline. Despite the attention of Phipps he put the ball down for a try. No try, but it wasn’t because of a NZ knock-on. We’ve gone way back for a NZ penalty for an Australian player entering a ruck from the side.

Small mercies. Australia put it through the hands from within the New Zealand 22, short stabby passes that find their way to Phipps on the left wing. He puts his head down low and goes goes goes, burrowing through four tacklers to reach out and score. That’s something. The conversion attempt from wide out is missed. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.47am EDT 07:47 74 min: Read goes to the bin after he’s given a yellow card in his attempts to slow down the play, to prevent the Aussies getting a modicum of pleasure out of this game.

But they win a penalty, at least, and find touch a few metres out from the New Zealand line. Can they score a consolation try? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.44am EDT 07:44 70 min: Just when it seems the All Blacks will score another they turn it over a few metres out from the Aussie line. A temporary reprieve no doubt. Polota-Nua finds his own man from a lineout. When the All Blacks have won five lineouts on Australia’s throw that’s an achievement worth mentioning. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.42am EDT 07:42 68 min: My colleague Dan Lucas reminds me that the All Blacks’ biggest ever winning margin over Australia is 37 points. Unless Australia do something soon that record is about to be broken. Speaking of Australia doing something, they win a lineout! Then Kuridrani spills his lollies as he hit the Black line at pace.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.34am EDT 07:34 63 min: I really don’t think the Wallabies can come back from here. Moore is off, replaced by Polota-Nua. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.32am EDT 07:32 Try! Australia 3-42 (Savea 59) Almost from the restart New Zealand score another! Through the hands the ball flew until Whitelock popped a peach of a pass that led to Barrett finding Savea on the left touchline. He bumped off the cover tackle of Genia to score just inside the corner post. That’s his 40th try in just 44 Tests! Barrett, showing mercy, misses the conversion from the left touchline. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.30am EDT 07:30 Try!

Updated at 7.33am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.28am EDT 07:28 56 min: And the young man’s first touch comes off without a hitch. Can’t say the same for Kuridrani who then drops a pass cold which Fekitoa picks up before striding away towards the line. Foley does well to pull him down just short but the All Blacks recycle the ball, spin it right and find Dan Coles on the overlap... Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.25am EDT 07:25 54 min: After six phases Australia realise they’ve pushed the envelope and Kefu spills the ball just outside the All Blacks’ 22. And that will end Kefu’s night. He’s been replaced by a debutant with a wonderful name, Allan Alaalatoa. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.23am EDT 07:23 53 min: As Australia lose another lineout on their own throw (was it the NZ room bugged or the Aussie room, I forget) I can report Slipper is on for Sio, and Mumm is on for Simmons. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.21am EDT 07:21 52 min: Pocock steals the ball inside the Australia half and Genia box kicks it down field with nobody home. But NZ recover. Of course they do. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.20am EDT 07:20 49 min: Another scrum to Australia, this one 10 m inside NZ territory but Sio turns it over and Cruden is on the tear down field! He kicks it in behind for Savea who is ahead in the race for the ball but it just bounces over the dead ball line before he can touch it down for a try. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.17am EDT 07:17 47 min: Kieran Read charges towards the line but he knocks the ball foward, helped in the knocking on by a reefing arm from Foley. Scrum to Australia 10m out, Genia with a shaved head, and the ball in hand. A few Wallabies have shaved their heads for this one. If you haven’t heard it’s to show solidarity to ex-Wallaby and Brumbies captain Christian Lealiifano who was recently diagnosed with leukemia. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.14am EDT 07:14 44 min: Another Foley kick is clipped by the defence! And it leads to the All Blacks pouring into the Wallabies’ 22 like malicious molasses. Surely that was a forward pass by Dan Coles but it’s not pulled up and a moment later Cruden grubbers —and Dagg cleans up the dregs. Haylett-Petty, who fumbled that kick, does just enough to keep out Dagg who is held up over the line! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.11am EDT 07:11 42 min: The Wallabies force a turn over (good!) then moments later turn it over themselves (bad!). The All Blacks enjoyed 61% possession in that half and so far in the second nothing has changed. Well maybe a percentage or three. Haven’t seen the stats but it feels like 64%. Naholo is off, by the way, replaced by Julian Savea. Horne is off too. That’s three outside backs down and out in one half of football!

From a scrum in their own half the ball was fed to Foley whose attempted kick downfield was charged down by Kaino, rushing at Foley like an angry Pamplona bull. Kaino had time to wait for a nice bounce before striding the final few metres to the line.

Toomua, meantime, on for Giteau, is prostrate, having worn an accidental shoulder from Barrett. He’s heading off for a concussion test. If he’s smart he’ll say he sees three fingers when there are only two before him. The trusty Phil Withall write in to suggest the Wallabies’ concentration could have been better: “Maybe, just maybe, instead of attempting to recreate Watergate the Australians would have been better off focusing on their own game. This could end up worse than anything Kitty Chiller could create.” Matt Toomua lies prone on the turf.

Anu James   August 20, 2016 12:42 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares PV Sindhu with her silver medalReuters It was not 'PV Sindhu ranking' or 'PV Sindhu images' or even 'PV Sindhu age' that figured among the most searched keywords on Google about the Indian badminton player ahead of her matches in the Olympics. According to Google trends, one of the most searched keywords on the search engine for the past week was, and it may not shock you, 'PV Sindhu caste.' The 21-year-old badminton player, who bagged the silver medal at the Rio Olympics on Friday, Aug. 19, sent Indians all over the world into a celebratory tizzy. She is the first Indian woman to appear in a finals event, since the others before her, including the other star badminton player from the country — Saina Nehwal — had won bronze medals at the quadrennial  event. For some people, however, her successive wins at the various rounds of the Games merited a fact-checking mission of a different kind. Why advertise with us?

PV Sindhu caste is one of the most searchedkeyword on Google.Google/Screenshot Over the past one week, the number of searches for Sindhu's caste has seen a gradual rise on Google after she qualified to the semi-finals.  This particular keyword was most searched from people settled in India, and to be precise, more searches were from Andhra Pradesh and Telengana, where she actually belongs to, according to the Google trend. However, not just Indian residents, but also people settled in Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the UAE have been at the top five spots in searching for the caste that Sindhu belongs to. While some assert that she is a Telangana 'bidda' as Sindhu was born and brought up in Hyderabad, others maintain that she is an Andhra 'ammayi' as she belongs to Vijayawada. Her parents, former volleyball players Ramana and Vijayalakshmi, had a love marriage. So is Sindhu celebrating her victory in a caste-specific way? Well, no medals for guessing that.

Serbia take it out - the Boomers will play for bronze Live feed Show 7.59pm EDT 19:59 That’s it from us It was a dissappointing loss for the Boomers, but they can hardly find fault with the result the way that Serbia dominated that game from the opening minute. When they weren’t being pressured out of the ball, the Australians were sloppy on offence and couldn’t make inroads. At the other end, led by Milos Teodosic, Serbia were just too potent on offence. Thank you all for your company and do make sure you check back in for the gold medal game, which will bit this impressive Serbian squad against the NBA superstars of Team USA. It’ll be a genuine contest! A disappointed Boomers squad exits the arena after their semi-final loss to Serbia.

Australia have gone down by 26 points and Serbia are through to face the USA in the gold medal game. The Aussies? They’ll play Spain for bronze late on Sunday night (Monday 12:30am AEST, to be precise) after they’ve licked their wounds from this humbling loss.

I guess the heat has gone out of the game but he’s been a real shining light with seven points in this final quarter. Jokic nails a ridiculous fade-away jumper but it’s all a bit scrappy otherwise.

They need to stay off and rest up. In their absence, Brock Motum drains a corner three in front of the Boomers bench and gives their spirits a bit of a lift.

It’s hard to watch,” says Andrew Gaze, but as he points out, the Boomers are going to need to rally over the next 24 hours and prepare themselves for the bronze medal game. Australia has never won an Olympic medal in men’s basketball and that dream is still alive.

That’s not great news for the Spain encounter, if so. Out-coached and ou-tplayed: Australia’s Andrej Lemanis and Joe Ingles try to come up with a plan.

The Boomers have just been flat in this game, outplayed from the opening minute. Ingles lays one up before a time-out is called. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.27pm EDT 19:27 4th quarter (8:55 remaining): Australia 39-68 Serbia Unsurprisingly for a game so physical, we start off with a team foul and an unsportsmanlike one, which puts Bogut to the line for some free throws. They’re not his forte and he misses the second one. From the in-bound pass Ingles is stripped of the ball as he drives to the bucket. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.24pm EDT 19:24 Three-quarter time: Australia 38-66 Serbia - the Boomers are struggling Well that didn’t get any better. With ten minutes to go in this game the Boomers trail by 28 points and will struggle to get much closer. Serbia are too good at both ends of the court and the Boomers couldn’t have played worse. They don’t want a blow-out but really might be better off resting their starters for that bronze medal game. Milos Teodosic has been dominant for Serbia.

With a little over a minute to play in this third quarter the Boomers are no closer to hauling themselves back into the game. Right now they’re looking like playing for bronze against Spain. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.17pm EDT 19:17 3rd quarter (2:18 remaining) Australia 33-58 Serbia Serbia are very good. You can say the Aussies have been bad but they’re playing a damned fine basketball team. Teodosic has 20 points and four assists, and the Boomers have had no equivalent contributor. Lemanis’ team have not underestimated their opposition here but neither can they match their intensity and offensive prowess. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.14pm EDT 19:14 3rd quarter (3:43 remaining) Australia 29-53 Serbia Matthew Dellavedova wears a sweeping scar across the right side of his brow but his fighting qualities haven’t seen Australia through so far tonight and the lead has blown out to 23 points for Serbia, who pressure the Boomers ar every opportunity. The only spark is coming from Motum, who lays one up before Teodosic drains a three. The Motum commits an unsportsmanlike foul. At least he’s trying to make things happen. Things aren’t going to plan for Matthew Dellavedova and the Boomers. Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.10pm EDT 19:10 3rd quarter (4:38 remaining) Australia 25-46 Serbia Motum passes up a corner three opportunity to drive but misses with his left-handed lay-up, after which Serbia manage two with another lightning transition. Bogut succeeds with only one of his free throws and this game continues to drift away from the Boomers. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.07pm EDT 19:07 3rd quarter (5:46 remaining) Australia 24-42 Serbia Delly falls short with the three attempt I was begging for earlier and in the scramble that follows, Baynes draws a foul with his put-away attempt and makes one. Brock Motum is into the game now, perhaps in the hope he can get his mid-range shooting going. Boy do Australia need it. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.05pm EDT 19:05 3rd quarter (6:38 remaining) Australia 23-42 Serbia Australians have reason to love him, but geez would it kill Matthew Dellavedova to take a run at an open three here when Andrew Bogut screens off two defenders to open up the gap? Delly just pivots around on his own before round-arming a pass. Ungainly, you’d call it. With a couple of free throws Ingles trims the lead a little. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.02pm EDT 19:02 3rd quarter (7:33 remaining) Australia 19-40 Serbia Delly scores with a runner but Markovic nails an open three soon after to re-establish the 21-point lead. One step forward, two steps back. Mills misses a three down the other end. He certainly hasn’t had a hot hand tonight. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.00pm EDT 19:00 3rd quarter (8:38 remaining) Australia 17-37 Serbia Mills is like a spider-monkey in defence. They call that ‘active hands’, but they were more like speed-jazz hands in the face of Teodosic as the Serbian star tried to set a pick. Macvan makes a couple of free throws.

Photograph: Andrej Isakovic/AFP/Getty Images Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.45pm EDT 18:45 What has gone wrong for the Boomers so far? In a word, everything. They’ve shot terribly, making 6-29 from the field. That’s abominable. They’ve also had no answer for Milos Teodosic at the other end, and if the Serbian star wasn’t already on the radar of NBA teams before he certainly should be now. The Boomers have turned the ball over regularly and lacked anything approaching composure. It’s odd. They’ve looked so mature and battle-ready throughout this tournament but it all fell apart in that first half. They look overawed by the occasion and Serbia’s defence is just suffocating. No Australian is getting a good look and those distributing the ball have been hassled into regular turnovers.

They’re 21 points down at half-time and Serbia look unbeatable. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.40pm EDT 18:40 2nd quarter (0:21 remaining) - Australia 14-35 Serbia This is just getting ugly for the Boomers and the first half can’t end quick enough. They’ve doubled up on turnovers as opposed to scoring shots and there’s long-range misses from Mills and Goulding as the time ticks down. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.38pm EDT 18:38 2nd quarter (1:39 remaining) - Australia 14-32 Serbia Now Baynes takes a seat and he’s not looking happy with himself. Damian Martin is on for him as Australia go for some ‘small ball’, and Delly is back shortly thereafter. Australia’s 2-11 shooting for threes and 4-14 from two-point range. Serbia, on the other hand, are finding scoring a piece of cake. As it stands, the Boomers look like a team who’ll be playing for bronze unless they can pull off something remarkable. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.35pm EDT 18:35 2nd quarter (3:01 remaining) - Australia 14-28 Serbia Baynes is also well off for the Aussies tonight and misses another post move hooking around onto his left. Teodosic takes a rest, which is good news for the Boomers as they’ve had no answer for him tonight. Raduljica drives past Baynes to draw a foul and nails both free throws. He’s played in the NBA too, Raduljica, and it shows. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.33pm EDT 18:33 2nd quarter (3:50 remaining) - Australia 14-26 Serbia Kalinic makes a couple of free throws and Serbia continue to look the team to beat. The Aussies haven’t even done enough to get to the free throw line but they do score from a frenetic drive from Mills, but he misses a three soon after, as does Ingles. Oh dear, they need to make those to get back into this one. Both were good looks. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.31pm EDT 18:31 2nd quarter (5:07 remaining) - Australia 12-24 Serbia Australia finally score on transition but that’s the only time they’re looking like it. Maybe there is hope though: Adam Peacock (@adampeacock3) Serbia fell in a hole late against Croatia 2 days ago. Boomers got them right where they want them. August 19, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.29pm EDT 18:29 2nd quarter (5:30 remaining) - Australia 10-24 Serbia Geez, Australia’s offence is just deplorable at the moment and now Ingles turns the ball over with a sloppy pass towards Baynes, who didn’t see it coming regardless. How do they get back into this game? Dellavedova is lacking his usual fire so it might have to be Patty Mills to provide the spark plug. There’s been eight turnovers from six different Boomers. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.26pm EDT 18:26 2nd quarter (6:37 remaining) - Australia 10-24 Serbia “This is getting a little out of hand on the offensive end with the turnovers,” says Andrew Gaze, and he’s not wrong. At the other end the Boomers are being caned by Teodosic, who scores again from mid range and draws a foul too, which he makes. Australia call another time out to regroup. This game is not going to plan so far. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.25pm EDT 18:25 2nd quarter (6:49 remaining) - Australia 10-21 Serbia The hyper-physical defence continues as Dellavedova virtually tackles Teodosic but somewhat surprisingly it’s only Australia’s third foul. Teodosic soon moves his way to nine points for the game and Macvan gets two as well. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.22pm EDT 18:22 2nd quarter (8:19 remaining) - Australia 10-16 Serbia Ryan Broekhoff! The 25-year-old from Frankston rains down a big three from well beyond the line and that’s the perfect start for the Boomers. He was six feet out from the line, at least. Broekhoff knows this Euro-ball well and is certainly not intimidated by the fact that both sides are playing it like a game of rugby. Ingles then lays it up in transition and the Australians have the first five points as Serbia call time out. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.18pm EDT 18:18 End of the first quarter - Australia 5-16 Serbia Oof, Anderson misses a corner three and with that we’re done in the first quarter. Australia trail by 11 points but to be honest with you, they couldn’t have played much worse on offence so the damage isn’t actually too bad. Lemanis needs to draw up a few plays though. There’s just been zero scoring threat at all. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.16pm EDT 18:16 1st quarter (0:21 remaining) - Australia 5-16 Serbia Now a turnover from Bogut! That’s five from the Aussies and it came as they set up for another offensive move. Where’s Chris Goulding? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.14pm EDT 18:14 1st quarter (1:58 remaining) - Australia 5-14 Serbia NBL defensive player of the year Kevin Lisch is in this team on account of that element of his CV and he comes up trumps here, drawing an offensive foul from Bogdanovic as the Serbian posts up. Australia’s offence is barely functioning right now but they’re solid on defence. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.12pm EDT 18:12 1st quarter (2:52 remaining) - Australia 5-14 Serbia Ingles mightn’t be shooting well but his hustle leads to a turnover and the Australians are starting to work their way into the game with hard graft. Anderson misses a jump shot from the free throw line and Bogdanovic weaves his way to a lay-up at the other end. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.10pm EDT 18:10 1st quarter (4:07 remaining) - Australia 5-12 Serbia Anderson makes his entry with an offensive foul, which isn’t ideal. Teodosic misses a three and then also a mid-range jump shot, but at the other end Serbia is happy for Joe Ingles to shoot because his range is well off. Delly tries to slow things down and finds Baynes in the post for an easy dunk. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.08pm EDT 18:08 1st quarter (5:41 remaining) - Australia 3-12 Serbia Every Australian shot is a tough one for now but at the other end, Teodosic is finding space and shooting beautifully. Again, how is this guy not in the NBA? Lemanis has to make a move here and brings Anderson in for Bogut to increase Australia’s scoring threat. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.06pm EDT 18:06 1st quarter (6:25 remaining) - Australia 3-10 Serbia Bang! Mills hits a corner three and the Australians are finally on the board. They needed that. The defence has been smothering from Serbia and Dellavedova is harried out of possession; he seems a little scrambled so far. He had 23 points and 13 assists the last time these teams met but he’s at sea right at the moment. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.04pm EDT 18:04 1st quarter (7:54 remaining) - Australia 0-8 Serbia Serbia have settled well in the opening stages but it’s been very scrappy stuff from the Boomers with a turnover for Delly and a botched spin move from Baynes, so with a big dunk from Raduljica, Australian coach Andrej Lemanis calls a time out. Oof, that’s imposing from Serbia. Serbia’s Miroslav Raduljica scores. Photograph: Eric Gay/AP Updated at 8.03pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.02pm EDT 18:02 1st quarter (8:54 remaining) - Australia 0-2 Serbia Andrew Bogut gets the opening tip and Dellavedova takes control for the first possession but Joe Ingles misses an open three before Kalinic opens the scoring for Serbia. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.00pm EDT 18:00 The anthems are now done and we’re only moments away from this semi-final clash. Serbia will indeed be sticking with their starting five from the Croatia game, which is not typical - eight different players have featured in the starting five throughout these Games. I guess you call that depth? Anyway, let’s do this! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.54pm EDT 17:54 OK, the broadcast is now under way and Australians are greeted by the comforting sight of the nation’s favourite uncle, Andrew Gaze, who is beaming with pride at the thought of Australia potentially claiming its first Olympic medal in the men’s division. “We’ve got to be very physical,” says Gaze of this match-up. “I’d like to see us get out and run a bit more than we have to avoid the half-court slog.” He’s appropriately wary of this Serbian line-up. This is going to be a real slog, though that won’t scare the Aussies, who love the rough stuff. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.50pm EDT 17:50 Our likely starting fives tonight There’s a lot of NBA experience here for the Australians but not only that, a range of genuine threats from the bench, where David Anderson provides veteran nous, Chris Goulding a constants scoring threat and plenty of hustle otherwise. Australia: Matthew Dellavedova, Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Aron Baynes, Andrew Bogut Aus bench: David Andersen, Kevin Lisch, Ryan Broekhoff, Chris Goulding, Brock Motum, Damian Martin, Cameron Bairstow (injured). Serbia: Milos Teodosic, Stefan Markovic, Milan Macvan, Nikola Kalinic, Miroslav Raduljica Serbia bench: Marko Simonovic, Vladimir Stimac, Nikola Jokic, Stefan Jovic, Nemanja Nedovic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Stefan Bircevic. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.45pm EDT 17:45 Preamble Hello all and welcome to this live coverage as Australia’s Boomers move towards the uncharted territory of a potential medal in the men’s basketball. Their opponents in this semi-final are Serbia, who they beat by 15 points in the preliminary games but will doubtless prove a harder obstacle today. If Australia has been the revelation of this basketball tournament, the Serbians are equally potent. Veteran Milos Teodosic is a star (how is he not in the NBA?) and the likes of Miroslav Raduljica, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Nikola Jokic go reasonably well too. They were very impressive in holding their nerve in a virtual free throw shoot-out in the final minute of the quarters against Croatia. The Australians most of us know well for their NBA exploits - Delly, Millsy, Baynesy and, err, Boguty. They’re playing with fire and spirit in these Games but also, just whisper it...they’re actually good enough at this point to win games like this. We shall see.

Googles Duo was only released a few days ago and it is already sitting at number one in the Google Play Store and reached top 30 on the iOS app store. All this thanks to Duos dead simple setup which only requires a mobile number to be confirmed via SMS. Android Police has gotten their hands on a tester build of the unreleased Allo app which Google announced back at Google I/O this year promising a smart messenger that can predict your answers and learns how you communicate with your friends. There are many sticker packs with weird, outrageous and somewhat suggestive stickers. Some sticker packs for Google Allo You will be able to download sticker packs and arrange them in any order youd like under My Stickers. And although these stickers are in the test build of the app, there is no guarantee that theyll make it to the final product. There will probably be some people who are easily offended by these stickers who take life too seriously. Check out the full post from Android Police with more sticker pack screenshots at the source link below.

Chrome apps, however, will remain supported by Chrome OS for the foreseeable future.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google announced that it will be gradually phasing out support for Chrome apps on Windows, Mac and Linux, eventually only supporting the apps on the Chrome OS. According to Google, there are two types of Chrome apps, namely hosted apps and packaged apps. Hosted apps are currently implemented as regular web apps, which makes them accessible to all users with an internet connection. Google has found, on the other hand, that only about 1 percent of Windows, Mac and Linux users actively use packaged Chrome apps. With this information, Google revealed through a blog post that it will now begin to remove support for hosted and packaged Chrome apps for Windows, Mac and Linux over the next couple of years. The Chrome apps, however, will remain supported by Chrome OS for the foreseeable future, with upcoming enhancements to Chrome apps only to apply to Chrome OS devices and developers only now allowed to build Chrome apps for Chrome OS. Beginning late this year, new Chrome apps can only be accessed by Chrome OS users. All current Chrome apps, however, will remain accessible on all platforms, with developers allowed to release updates for them. By next year's second half, there will be no more Chrome apps for Windows, Mac and Linux on the Chrome Web Store, and by early 2018, users with computers on these operating systems will no longer be able to use Chrome apps. This gives time for users to find alternatives, and for developers to build out the affected apps into standard web apps. Chrome OS has been a success for Google, as because of the low price of the computers using the operating system and its relative ease to manage, Chromebooks have been increasing their presence in corporate and educational settings. However, Chrome OS does not have as many apps compared to the massive app libraries of Windows and Mac. As a solution, Google released Chrome apps, which allowed developers to create web apps that functioned similarly to traditional standalone apps. The selling point was that these Chrome apps were universal, and did not require any extra effort from developers to make them compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux computers as users on these platforms can access the apps through the Chrome browser. The experiment was an interesting one, to say the least, but it has apparently failed. In addition to ending support for Windows, Mac and Linux users due to very low adoption figures, the fact that Android apps will soon be coming to Chrome OS paints a bleak forecast for Chrome apps.

Some of the most-popular among these include SwiftKey, Fleksy or even Google Keyboard. Almost all of these keyboard apps have some sort of cloud integration built-in, which automatically saves our frequently used words and jargons. Based on the words saved, the keyboard apps then predict the next word a user is going to type before they even think about it. This 'auto-complete' feature thus not only saves times, but also makes the apps' AI-based prediction engines better over the time. I started off with stock Google keyboard a few years ago, but soon got bored of it as it lacked a number of features at the time. Then I switched to SwiftKey (main app) and used it for a couple of years, following it up by Fleksy and then reverting to SwiftKey (Beta). So last week, I decided to have some fun by relying completely on the keyboard's auto-complete feature for each of my replies for 24 hours. As expected, it turned out to be quite a day as I indulged in endless (and pointless) arguments with people almost all the time. Because of the nature of my job I have to stay in touch with my editor and a whole lot of people for news at almost all the times, whether it's over Google Hangouts, WhatsApp, Email or even Slack. I did not warn anyone about this upcoming (potential) catastrophe and started my day by chatting with my editor like this. Editor: Hi, have we covered the Facebook story? Me: I know you are the best person who can give me a call from a #beer bottle while coming back to office. Well. This happened on WhatsApp and if you look at it, this is not the best thing that could happen early morning (provided your editor is already not mad at you for some other reason). So I naturally got a "What?" from my editor, to which my keyboard decided to once again give the most absurd reply ever. The conversation didn't go for long as soon after the reply I got a direct call from him (was expecting this). Not only I messed up in the office but also managed to piss off a PR (who also happen to be close friends of mine), when she asked about my weekend plans. Friend: Hey, what's the weekend scene? Now, when I say I made her go angry, it was on certain levels. I started off by replying. And as a co-incidence she had quit her job recently. It went worse in the next few threads, resulting in both of us abusing each other. She's still angry. While this was on WhatsApp, things got really funny over email. On the mail you can't just get away with a one-line answer. So this is what I wrote to one of the company's executives, in reply to a query related to a gadget. I can't say how seriously the person took it, but I never got a reply back from him. As mentioned above, there was no secret study behind me completely relying on the keyboard auto-complete word prediction feature. However, this led me to conclude that keyboard auto-complete is something that still has a lot of room for improvement. Also, the companies need to make the feature more secure and stable as recently, we saw SwiftKey faced with a bug that showed users word predictions from strangers' smartphones, revealing their names, address, contact numbers and more. That said, auto-prediction, a feature that was once a mere figment of imagination, has come a long way over the years, with more powerful and improved AI running behind the scenes. I am waiting for the day when it becomes so advanced that it could churn out sentences that really make sense and are actually what we intend to type.

Google's cloud platform group this week announced general availability of Cloud Bigtable, a fully managed database service capable of handling petabyte- scale workloads. The announcement was one of three from the Cloud Platform Group this week. Google this week also announced general availability of its Cloud Datastore managed NoSQL database service and talked up its existing and forthcoming support for applications built in Microsoft's ASP.Net environment. Cloud Bigtable is a technology that Google has used internally for several years. It powers many of Google's most heavily used services, such as Gmail, Search, Maps and Analytics. It is designed to handle very large data sets at high speeds. According to Google, that makes it well-suited for analytical and operational applications, such as financial data analysis, internet of things and user analytics. Google has previously described Bigtable as delivering more than double the performance of other NoSQL technologies, such as Cassandra and Hbase, while running faster and delivering a lower total cost of ownership. Google built Bigtable to "handle use cases ranging from low latency real-time data serving to high-throughput web indexing and analytics," Misha Brukman, product manager for Google Cloud Bigtable, wrote in a blog post announcing general availability of the technology. Over the years, Bigtable has had a big impact on the NoSQL database ecosystem and inspired other scalable database technologies like Hbase and Cassandra, he said. Google this week also announced general availability of a new API for customers of its Cloud Datastore NoSQL database service. The new v1 API for Cloud Datastore enables enterprises to access their Google Compute Engine database or their Google Container Engine database from a broader range of endpoints and computing environments. In addition to enabling better cross-platform access to Datastore, Google this week also announced several resources that are available to companies to help them use the technology more effectively. One is a new, simplified method for calculating database size for pricing purposes. Another is a set of best practices for managing Datastore transactions and ensuring consistent querying of the database. In addition to the product- and service-related announcements Google this week also touted its support for applications built on Microsoft's ASP.NET. In a blog post, Chris Sells, product manager of cloud developer tools at Google, pointed to several examples where he claimed the company has made it easier for enterprises to run ASP.NET applications on Google's cloud. For instance, Google supports the ability for organizations to create new Compute Engine virtual machines from a Windows Server Data Center base image, he said. In addition, Google has released several new versions of SQL Server that will be available as base images on Google Compute Engine along with Windows Server, Sells said. "With Windows Server, ASP.NET and SQL Server, you've got everything you need to bring your ASP.NET 4.x sites and services to Google Cloud Platform," Sells noted. "We think you're going to be happy that you did."             LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   New Tool Shines Light on $5 Billion Web Traffic Fraud Racket Microsoft's Azure Advisor Helps Customers Float Cloud Applications Early Stage Startup Heptio Aims to Make Kubernetes Friendly Google, Intel to Collaborate on Cloud, IoT Technolgies Social Media Sites Take Risks When Blocking Speech They Don't Like                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Business Home LBoard Family cremates wrong body after hospital mix-up FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US AT&T, Apple, Google to work on ‘robocall’ crackdown Reuters | August 20, 2016 AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among members of the "Robocall Strike Force" that held its first meeting with the US Federal Communications Commission. WASHINGTON: More than 30 major technology and communication companies said on Friday they are joining the US government to crack down on “robocalls,” automated, prerecorded phone calls that regulators have labeled a “scourge.” AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among members of the “Robocall Strike Force” that held its first meeting with the US Federal Communications Commission. The strike force will report to the FCC by Oct. 19 on “concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,” said AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson, chairman of the group. The strike force hopes to implement Caller ID verification standards to help block calls from spoofed phone numbers and consider a “Do Not Originate” list that would block spoofers from impersonating legitimate phone numbers from governments, banks or others. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in July urged major companies to take new action to block robocalls, which often come from telemarketers or scam artists. “This scourge must stop,” Wheeler said on Friday, calling robocalls the No. 1 complaint from consumers. “The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology,” Wheeler said. In the past, he has said robocalls continue “due in large part to industry inaction.” Stephenson emphasized “the breadth and complexity” of the problem. “This is going to require more than individual company initiatives and one-off blocking apps,” Stephenson said. “Robocallers are a formidable adversary, notoriously hard to stop.” The FCC does not require robocall blocking and filtering but has strongly encouraged phone service providers to offer those services at no charge. The strike force brings together carriers, device makers, operating system developers, network designers and the government. “We have to come out of this with a comprehensive play book for all of us to go execute,” Stephenson said. “We have calls that are perfectly legal, but unwanted, like telemarketers and public opinion surveyors. At the other end of the spectrum, we have millions of calls that are blatantly illegal.” Stephenson said technical experts representing the companies have had “preliminary conversations about short- and longer-term initiatives.” Joan Marsh, AT&T vice president of federal regulatory issues, called the problem complicated. “We have been wrangling with this problem long enough to know there is no silver bullet,” she said. “Nothing by itself is going to do it.” Other companies taking part include Blackberry Ltd (BB.TO), British Telecommunications Plc, Charter Communications Inc, Frontier Communications, LG Electronics Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nokia Corp, Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Sirius XM Holdings Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and US Cellular Corp. Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said the task force is a sign “phone companies are taking more serious steps to protect their customers from unwanted calls.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

Now, Google is trying to send that same message to enterprises. The last Google database services still in beta moved into general availability this week, as the cloud provider made a handful of other upgrades to Google Compute Engine. The enhancements are part of a continued push to make headway with enterprise customers by signaling that Google's platform is production-ready. The Google database services now fully available include the latest version of Cloud SQL, which targets MySQL databases and supplants the first generation that was rolled out five years ago. It's Google's equivalent to Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Relational Database; and the newest iteration, which is built on persistent disk, represents an improvement of seven times in speed and 20 times more storage than its predecessor, according to Google. Cloud Bigtable is now fully available for NoSQL databases. The fully managed service is intended for next-generation applications that require low latency or high throughput at petabyte scale. Lytics, a personalized marketing and customer data platform provider based in Portland, Ore., moved from AWS to Google Cloud Platform a year ago. And six weeks ago, it moved from Apache Cassandra to Bigtable. The company went from 60 nodes to a six-node Bigtable cluster, and the service is costing about one-third of what they were paying before, said Aaron Raddon, CTO and co-founder. With Bigtable, there's zero maintenance; you just plug it in and get the same, amazing, fast performance. Aaron RaddonCTO and co-founder of Lytics "Cassandra, we loved, but you had to be really careful to design the keys really well, or you'd get hot spots on the server, which is not a good situation," Raddon said. "With Bigtable, there's zero maintenance; you just plug it in and get the same, amazing, fast performance." Cloud Datastore, another fully managed NoSQL database service that Google says handles over 15 trillion queries per month, is now available via an API. This extends the existing service beyond App Engine. All of these Google database services now fall under the provider's cloud service-level agreement, offering a certain level of uptime assurances for customers that demand high availability. Handwritten invite for enterprises For the first time, we are seeing Diane Greene's handwriting. Holger Muellerprincipal analyst and vice president at Constellation Research Google is seen as a distant third in the public cloud behind Microsoft Azure and market leader Amazon Web Services, and its relationship with enterprise clients has been particularly lacking. VMware founder and former CEO Diane Greene was brought in to head Google's cloud division last November to "teach the enterprise to Google," and we're starting to see her effect on the strategy for the platform, said Holger Mueller, principal analyst and vice president at Constellation Research Inc., based in Cupertino, Calif. "For the first time, we are seeing Diane Greene's handwriting," he said. Google is smart to push its big data chops, which is an area of strength for the company, Mueller said. It uses premium hardware compared to many of its competitors, which can translate to better performance for next-generation applications. Other upgrades to the platform include the beta release of the ability to run Microsoft SQL Server on Compute Engine with existing application licenses; an increase in read and write IOPS for solid-state drive-backed persistent disk volumes, from 15,000 to 25,000; and faster retrieval times from Google Nearline cold storage.

Google’s new app might give them a run for their money By Komando Staff, Komando.com Digit.in So many companies are working on virtual reality headsets that will project our presence into far away places. Being there, without really being there, will be the wave of the future. But until that day comes, video calling is the next best thing. Video calling services keep bonds strong; not only can you hear their voice, but you can virtually be face to face. You can read your kids a bedtime story while you're away on a business trip, stare into your long-distance lover's eyes, or wish faraway relatives a Merry Christmas. You can already use Skype, Facebook Messenger, and FaceTime to make video calls but now, Google wants to throw their hat in the ring. Their service is called Google Duo and it has some cool features that may detract attention from the other services. The "Knock Knock" feature makes Google Duo stand out, it works like a peephole. With other services, you see the caller's contact picture but with Google Duo you can view a live video of the caller. Before you place a call, a selfie cam comes up so you can see what you look like. That way you can save yourself the embarrassment of video calling with food stuck in your teeth. Google says the video and sound quality will be better than the competition. If your Wi-Fi signal becomes weak during the call, Duo will automatically switch to data. And if you're receiving a call you'll have more time to answer it because your phone will ring for over a minute. The name Duo alludes to the fact that this service is for one on one calls. Unlike Google Hangout, Google Duo does not allow group calls or chats. The point is to communicate on a personal level. It also works on Apple and Android devices so everyone can use it. Please share this information with everyone.

Google Releases Chrome Extension That Restores Backspace as "Back" Button GO Google removed Backspace shortcut support in Chrome 52 Aug 20, 2016 01:10 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Google has published a Chrome extension named Go Back With Backspace, thus restoring a feature the company removed from its browser in Chrome 52, which was released at the start of August. Back in May, to the dismay of a large majority of its users, Google announced it would remove the "navigate back" functionality of the Backspace keyboard shortcut, which doubled for so many years as a "Back" button. Four in 10,000 users used the Backspace key as a Back button Google explained its decision by saying that only 0.04 percent of all Chrome users used the keyboard shortcut to navigate back. Additionally, 0.005 percent of those Backspace presses (and "back" navigations) came on web pages containing forms, meaning the user most likely pressed it by accident and lost all the form's data, requiring to refill all the fields. As such, the company decided to improve the browser's UX (User Experience) by removing the ability to go back to the previous page by pressing the Backspace button. Chrome's more hardcore users didn't like the change, and the company was on the receiving end of some hate-filled criticism. Eventually, the Chrome community moved on, and developers created Chrome extensions that replaced the functionality when Chrome 52 came out at the start of August, and the feature was officially removed from Chrome's codebase. Google decides to release official extension In the past, Chrome extension developers had been known to suddenly change their mind and start delivering malicious code or ads via extensions that became very popular. Most likely to avoid this kind of developers from taking advantage of Chrome users looking for an alternative, Google has now released an official extension that replicates the original functionality. The Go Back With Backspace extension works by loading some JavaScript code on your page and nothing else. The extension works just like the original feature, but not on Chrome internal pages (those starting with "chrome://"). At the time of writing, the extension has only over 10,000 installs, meaning Google was right in removing the Backspace functionality since it wasn't that popular among its regular non-tech users. #Google Chrome#Backspace#Go Back With Backspace#Chrome extension#Chrome subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Will Discontinue Chrome Apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux in Early 2018 Google Working on New OS That's Not Android, Chrome OS, or Linux-Related Google Will Kill Flash in Chrome by the End of the Year Chrome 52 Released with Support for CSS Containment and Performance Measurement iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    Go Back With Backspace Chrome extension Related Apps SkyHistory: Record and save your Skype chat history and call logs with this application that offers contact management and bookmarking of important messages Outlook4Gmail: Synchronize your Outlook and Gmail accounts by transferring all the important data like contacts and calendar events between them Emby Server: A media server that you can use to organize your entire video, audio and photo collection and access it remotely from multiple devices WebSite Auditor: Enable on-page optimization for your website and assure its place in the top rankings of Google thanks to this comprehensive SEO program Betternet: Navigate the Internet anonymously or with a different IP address and get the opportunity to visit any website, using this VPN server application SEO SpyGlass: Monitor and manage the backlinks for your website in order to increase its online popularity and overall visibility, with the help of this handy tool Rank Tracker: Monitor your website's search engine rankings with the help of this comprehensive and reliable application, dedicated to webmasters Reader comments Load old comments   Twitter Down for Some Users - Update: It's Back more on: Twitter i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Aug 19, 2016 at 5:55PM Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has lots of cash, and the business produces massive amounts of money on a recurrent basis. This could sound like the typical "nice problem to have" situation -- however, that money is not currently being used very efficiently.  If management wanted to go shopping for high-growth companies in the tech sector, players such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) could be interesting candidates to consider. Alphabet should go shopping According to financial reports for the second quarter of 2016, Alphabet has nearly $78.46 billion in cash and equivalents plus marketable securities on its balance sheet. The business is also a cash-generating machine: Free cash flow over the trailing-12-month period ended in June 2016 amounted to $19.96 billion, a strong increase of 24% year over year. GOOG Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts. It makes sense to keep some cash at hand in case of a rainy day, but Alphabet is well beyond covering liquidity needs, especially since the business generates strong and growing free cash flows year after year. The company's cash hoard is mostly invested in low-risk assets such as U.S. government notes, and these kinds of securities are currently paying historically low interest rates.  Since Alphabet doesn't really need to keep all that money in cash, investing in smaller companies with attractive growth potential could be a far more profitable idea. Especially when it comes to companies such as Netflix and Twitter, which have a lot to offer in terms of synergies.  Tuning in to Netflix Netflix could be an interesting acquisition target for Alphabet, and a deal between the two companies would surely change the competitive landscape in online streaming. To begin with, Netflix has a market capitalization around $41.2 billion at current prices, meaning that Alphabet has enough financial firepower to swallow Netflix and even pay a substantial premium over current market value. Buying Netflix would allow Alphabet to make big inroads in online video, a key growth area in which Alphabet is already a top player thanks to its ubiquitous YouTube platform. Alphabet's Google launched its YouTube Red subscription service in October of last year, showing that the company is clearly interested in exploring new video monetization venues beyond advertising.  Netflix ended the second quarter of 2016 with 83.2 million members globally. The company has the first-mover advantage in streaming, and a valuable library of content including both licensed and original productions. Netflix and Google together would own two of the most powerful platforms in streaming, a remarkably promising business with spectacular potential for growth over the long term. Content is a key differentiating factor in the industry, and it requires massive amounts of money. Netflix is reportedly planning to spend nearly $5 billion in programming during 2016. By joining forces with Alphabet and its deep pockets, Netflix would have access to plenty of cash to invest in this crucial area.  Should Alphabet finally go after Twitter? There has been plenty of speculation on the possibility of Alphabet buying Twitter lately, and such a move would make sense from multiple points of view. Twitter stock is down by more than 30% in the last 12 months on the back of disappointing user growth over the past several quarters. The company has market capitalization around $13.4 billion at current prices, which makes it quite affordable for a tech juggernaut such as Alphabet. Twitter has 313 million monthly users as of the second quarter of 2016, and the user base expanded by a modest 3% year over year last quarter. Alphabet's Google has seven different services and applications with over 1 billion monthly users each: Google search, Gmail, Chrome, Android, Maps, YouTube, and Google Play. Integrating the two companies could do wonders for Twitter in terms of jump-starting user growth. Google is also the undisputed leader in online advertising, so there could be clear synergies from a fusion in terms of joined monetization strategies. Besides, Google has failed to make inroads in social media, as its Google Plus platform has never really gained much traction among users. Buying Twitter would give Alphabet a strong foothold in social media and access to valuable data on trending topics and consumers' behavior which Twitter has collected over the years. The benefits of an Alphabet move Capital allocation can have a considerable impact on a company and its performance for investors over the years. Alphabet's cash would arguably be much better invested in high-growth companies such as Netflix or Twitter than in fixed-income securities paying minuscule interest rates.

Google has announced that after three years, they’re shutting down Chrome apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux.  In a blog post, vice president of product management Rahul Roy-Chowdhury writes that after its inception three years ago, Google is shutting down the app web store because many of its offerings are available on web applications that work on different types of browsers. Over the next year, Google says new Chrome apps will only be functional on Chrome OS devices, and in late 2017, the Chrome Web Store won’t show Chrome apps for Windows, Mac, or Linux.  Roy-Chowdhury writes that only 1 percent of Chrome users across these three operating systems were using Google apps at all. It’s a quiet end for what was once a niche platform that offered a home for a certain subset of game developers such as Goodgame Studios and Plarium, and its closure will mean that a host of browser games likely will only be playable on devices operating Chrome OS.  Previously, Google had shut down its Native Client technology, which briefly hosted games like Bastion in Google Chrome, and allowed developers to publish their games in the browser as well as on Steam.  Google is encouraging developers to migrate their Chrome apps to the web, if they haven’t done so already.  Related Jobs Disruptor Beam — FRAMINGHAM, Massachusetts, United States [11.22.16] Senior Producer Wargaming America, Inc. — Emeryville, California, United States [11.16.16] Senior Monetization Specialist The Walt Disney Company — Palo Alto, California, United States [11.11.16] Sr. Product Manager, Midcore Mobile Games Turner Broadcasting — Atlanta, Georgia, United States [10.25.16] Manager, Developer Relations - Cartoon Network Games [View All Jobs] Top Stories The challenges and rewards of designing local multiplayer games Appealing to kids as well as longtime fans in World of Final Fantasy Xbox One game streaming heading to Oculus Rift Blog: The financial reality of being indie and doing just okay [Next News Story]    [View All] 279595 newswire /view/news/279595/Google_Chrome_apps_are_riding_off_into_the_sunset.php Loading Comments TECHNOLOGY GROUP Black Hat Content Marketing Institute Content Marketing World Dark Reading Enterprise Connect Fusion GDC GTEC Gamasutra HDI ICMI InformationWeek Interop ITX Network Computing No Jitter VRDC COMMUNITIES SERVED Content Marketing Enterprise IT Enterprise Communications Game Development Information Security IT Services & Support WORKING WITH US Advertising Contacts Event Calendar Tech Marketing Solutions Contact Us Licensing Terms of Service Privacy Statement Copyright © 2016 UBM, All rights reserved

To make sure you never miss an issue, subscribe to my weely email briefing. News Google Plus takes another hit—Google has been marginalizing Google Plus for some time and the trend continues with the announcement that G+ Hangouts on Air will be discontinued as of September 12. Instead, Google is moving Hangouts on Air to YouTube Live. Several of Hangouts on Air’s best features aren’t making the transition, notably the Q&A tool. Google suggests you use the Q&A feature in Google Slides instead. The takeaway: Google Plus is dead. It just hasn’t fallen down yet. I am planning to move the For Immediate Release podcast community from Google+ to Facebook. If you have invested in Google Plus, you should start thinking about your transition strategy. Read more Twitter adds content filters—In an effort to combat harassment, Twitter has unveiled a “quality filter” that lets you “improve the quality of Tweets you see by using a variety of signals, such as account origin and behavior.” You can also now limit notifications to only people you follow. The takeaway: Twitter harassment has reached epidemic levels. Any tools to improve the experience are welcome. Read more NPR drops comments—It’s a bona fide trend: Publishers are dropping comments from their online content. NPR is the latest, announcing this week it will favor other channels for communication with listeners. A post from NPR’s managing editor for digital news noted that “the comment sections on NPR.org stories are not providing a useful experience for the vast majority of our users.” The post referenced Facebook and Twitter as the best channels, each of which already are major sources of engagement. The takeaway: When most publishers (and organizations) opened comments, it was the only way users could engage. Most commenting has shifted to other channels anyway. Comment moderation is a massive time suck. Encouraging conversation on social platforms where you already have a presence—and experimenting with new ones—makes good sense. Frankly, most of the comments on my content happens away from my blog on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook, and that’s without me closing off the comments on my blog, which continues to serve as the primary home for my stuff. Read more Facebook traffic to news site drops by double digits—Facebook’s algorithm changes that favor personal posts over news content has exacted a price. Traffic from Facebook to many key news publishers dropped by double digits in the second quarter—as much as 50%. The biggest losers include Newsweek, The New York Times, Time Inc., Vox, CNN, The Washington Post, Politico, and Business Insider. While the algorithm change is certainly a key factor, another is the increasing volume of content published by news organizations resulting in lower reach for any given piece of content. The takeaway: A Facebook strategy is important, but only as part of a multi-channel approach. As I’ve been saying, it’s why a channel expert is very likely going to be a new position in most agencies and in-house communication departments. Read more Twitter usage will grow just 2%—eMarketer projects Twitter usage will grow only 2% this year, a hefty drop from eMarketer’s February forecast of an 8% increase. “By the end of this year, 52.2 million people in the US will access their Twitter accounts at least once a month,” according to eMarketer, reflecting Twitter’s continuing struggle to grow its user base. Twitter’s share of social network users—281%—represents a drop from last year. The takeaway: Twitter is, without question, an important channel, but it’s also a publicly owned company and growth is vital to its survival. Few of its innovations have kicked off a new surge of growth. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Twitter acquired in the next year or two. Read more Pepsi is first to use a promoted Twitter sticker—Twitter introduced virtual stickers in June, not unlike Snapchat emojis, filters, and lenses. Now, Pepsi is the first to pay for a “#Promoted Stickers” campaign. Pepsi developed 50 stickers that will be included among all the various Twitter stickers. The takeaway: I can’t wait to see if users add Pepsi stickers to their photos. With apologies to Twitter, I just don’t see the platform being used for personal photo sharing—certainly not like Instagram and Snapchat. But never dismiss Pepsi marketing ideas. They’re known for successful innovation in the social space. Read more Instagram adds event channel to Explore lineup—Instagram has introduced a new channel to its Explore tab that spotlights video from concerts, sports, and other live events, personalized for each user based on their location and interests. Instagram is sourcing the content from users who share video from these events. The takeaway: Instagram is taking on Snapchat’s discover channels, which are hand-curated, limiting the ability to personalize them. While some may complain that the various apps are getting homogenous, Instagram is making smart moves to compete with Snapchat’s growing popularity and keep its half-billion monthly active users from defecting. For communicators, it creates an incentive to share a lot of video from marketing and other company-related events. Read more U.S. to relinquish control of Internet governance—It has long been the plan, but the actual handover of authority for governance of the Internet is now imminent. Effective October 1, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) will assume control of the domain-name system. ICANN—a nonprofit multi-stakeholder organization—has operated under American control since it was created and incorporated in 1998. The transition has been supported by the Obama, Bush, and Clinton administrations, yet it’s expected to produce partisan backlash. The takeaway: For those interested in how the Internet works, this is a big deal. Don’t expect to see anything change in your day-to-day online activities, though. Read more Instagram begins business profile rollout—Instagram has started its previously planned rollout of business profiles in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Inspired by Facebook’s Business Pages, the Instagram profiles feature a large contact button that lets users get in touch with a business via text, phone, or email. The profiles also feature a set of analytics and a feature for boosting strongly performing images as an ad. The profiles will come to the U.S., Australia and New Zealand within a few months and globally by the end of the year. The takeaway: If your company has an Instagram account, there will be no reason not to set up a business profile. Read more Emojis get a conference—Emojicon will be held in san Francisco in November, featuring speakers like the president of Unicode and co-chair of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee, and the founder of Emojipedia. Sponsors include Panda Express, which wants to see a dumpling added to the emoji set. The takeaway: My apologies to those who were waiting for emojis to vanish. A conference of its own bodes well for the future of the visual messaging tool. Read more Trends Cars are set to become an advertising and marketing platform—In case you missed the news, Ford’s CEO shared a post on LinkedIn this week announcing the company will have a fully-autonomous fleet of cars on the road by 2021. The fact that you won’t have to pay attention to the road in a few years means the 30-to-60 minutes everyone spends driving every day (according to the American Driving Survey) will become free time. Don’t think for a moment advertisers and marketers aren’t salivating over the prospect of having your attention while you’re trapped in your vehicle. While billboards are likely to suffer (with passengers likely looking down as long as they don’t need to watch the road), Augmented Reality, audio, and geo-local deals delivered via smartphone are among the technologies marketers will use to capture your attention. The takeaway: Anything’s better than those God-awful video monitors playing a loop of news and entertainment in taxis. There’s a real opportunity here to innovate and create genuine experiences for passengers. Read more Are you ready for Generation Z?—I can’t scroll through a feed without seeing half a dozen items addressing Millennials. Conversely, I rarely see anything dealing with Generation Z, the oldest of whom turn 21 this year. They’re similar to Millennials in a lot of ways, but they don’t align everywhere. They are, according to EY’s head of recruiting, “not a shy bunch. They’re more confident and assertive about their goals, and a lot more knowledgeable about employers than Millennials were at the same age.” They want to do work that makes a difference and has a positive impact on the world. They’re more concerned about job security than Millennials, having watched their parents’ careers tank as part of the Great Recession. They’re also more inclined to develop their skills and build their careers with a single employer than jump from job to job. The takeaway: Knowing the generation that’s just starting to infiltrate the workforce can help with employer branding efforts in order to recruit the best workers and in communicating with them once they’re on board. Read more The speed bump in the native advertising expressway—Love it or hate it, native advertising (aka sponsored content) isn’t going anywhere. It’s making too much money for publishers who have struggled to find a revenue stream in the digital world. But there’s a problem: Only 21% of sponsors are renewing their content, a rate described as weak. Some 40% of publishers say their renewal rates are below 50%. One reason for the hesitancy in renewing: advertisers aren’t sure if they’re getting an adequate return. Eight-five percent of native advertising dollars are going to the top five publishers, with the rest divided among the hundreds of smaller publishers offering native advertising. The takeaway: I don’t expect this to spell the end of native advertising. Instead, innovation needs to occur around metrics, the kinds of native services publishers offer, and value for smaller companies who advertise with niche publishers. Read more Employee advocacy programs come to highly regulated industries—Employee advocacy programs are ridiculously (and appropriately) popular, but they have been slow to find their way into financial services and healthcare organizations, where one ill-advised post by an employee can trigger huge regulatory headaches. Shifting demographics (two-thirds of the global workforce is under 35 years old) is leading even those industries to dip their toes into employee advocacy. The easiest and safest way to start: Tools that deliver approved ready-to-share content to employees. Humana and Capital One are using Dynamic Signal. The takeaway: Operating in the shadow of regulation is no reason to avoid employee advocacy. It’s only a reason to develop the policies and training that ensures compliance. Read more Pokémon Go should inspire a code of ethics for AR games—Pokémon Go is something new which (sadly but not surprisingly) is resulting in all manner of misbehavior, which should lead to an industry-wide set of ethical standards for similar games and tools. The takeaway: I couldn’t agree more, but industries are slow to develop such standards and, once (if ever) adopted, even slower to abide by them. Consider the codes of ethics for communications! Ultimately, this failure frequently results in government regulation. As companies find themselves under increasing pressure to take stands on social issues, coming together to adopt such standards should be a no-brainer. Read more Research Employees have ideas but companies aren’t listening—Nearly 60% of employees surveyed by the Medallia Institute say their leaders aren’t listening to their ideas for improving the customer experience. That’s a huge wasted opportunity, given that 78% of frontline employees say their leaders have made customer experience a top priority. Sixty-one percent of employees say they’re likely to come up with new ways to delight customers, 56% can think of ways to improve processes and practices, 47% have ideas for improving training and development, and 43% know how to reduce costs. The takeaway: Imagine that—employees doing the work have ideas for how to improve it. Communication doesn’t work if all you’re doing is talking. Listening needs to become a strategic priority that can best be led by the internal communications department. More to come on this; watch my blog for details. Read more Branded content campaigns grow, but so do views—Branded content campaigns grew 75% in the second quarter, suggesting that Mark Schaefer’s fear of “content crash” is well-founded. However, views of branded content grew by 2.2 times, exceeding the growth of campaigns with the click-through rate and overall viewing time remaining constant. The takeaway: The appetite for branded content, especially in the U.S., is unabated. I’d worry about content crash as a theoretical issue in order to ensure you’re always innovating ways to reach customers with content, but it just doesn’t seem to be happening as quickly as Mark anticipated. Read more A single channel is key to the customer experience—It takes two or more channels for 55% of customers to resolve an issue with a company, according to a study from The Northridge Group, and 44% believe companies don’t make it easy for customers to contact them. Consumers value first-contact resolution and 77% have turned to social media to try to get an answer or solution, even though 21% say they never get a response from companies they contact via social media. The takeaway: Creating a great customer experience is largely about doing the things that satisfy a customer. It’s great to create new experiences but they won’t help much if the customer is frustrated trying to get a simple answer to a question. I am increasingly amazed that so many companies invest so much in customer experience yet let queries languish on Facebook and Twitter. Read more Microinfluencers dominate influencer marketing—Brands are increasingly eschewing celebrities for microinfluencers. They may not be famous celebrities but they do have dedicated, highly engaged followers. A survey of microinfluencers found 60% believe Instagram is the best platform for engaging; only 18% said the same of Facebook. Snapchat is the new favorite channel among half of the microinfluencers surveyed, but only 1% favor it as a means of connecting with followers. The takeaway: Given that 84% of respondents charge less than $250 per Instagram post, microinfluencers could be a smart investment. The trick is finding them, but that’s why you’d want to connect with an influencer discovery tool like Little Bird. Read more Retailers are missing the boat by ignoring SMS—SMS text messaging is one of the least frequently used modes of communication for retailers. Only 29% are employing it, versus 97% for 3mail, 66% for phone, 82% for social media, and 32% for mobile apps. A study by Internet Retailer notes that retailers that are using text messaging “are seeing success in terms of efficiency, reach, and business impact.” The takeaway: Messaging apps have become the smartphone homescreen for a lot of people who also have embraced old-fashioned text messages. It may seem old-school, but it’s consistent with an undeniable trend. Read more Chatbots Chatbots are disruptive—The sheer number of chatbots functioning on Facebook Messenger, Kik, SMS, and other platforms is disruptive all by itself. Now, we’re seeing the rise of bots that “use a compilation of various chatbot languages,” hybrid applications being employed by Domino’s Pizza and CNN, among others. These bots improve user engagement and brand satisfaction. More advanced bots “will cause a revolution,” using proprietary Artificial Intelligence algorithms to project a unique personality. “They can create and deliver completely measurable advertising campaigns that bring together all the elements of integrated marketing,” according to VentureBeat. The takeaway: Most of the communicators I talk to are still only mildly curious about chatbots. There are 18,000 now running just on Facebook Messenger. Bots will play a significant role in all kinds of communication. Ignoring them now is like ignoring desktop publishing in 1986. Read more New York Times issues cease-and-desist to a chatbot—Chris McBride created a non-commercial chatbot called JULIA that answers food and cooking questions and recommends recipes from various websites. Some of those recipes come from The New York Times. Sharing a link on the web to a Times recipe is no big deal, but with a chatbot on a mobile device, the Times claims JULIA “is disintermediating us from the end user of the content.” The difference, according to a Medium post by McBride: “On the web, links are openly visible. Because a chatbot is a black box, however, it’s difficult, if not impossible for a third party to know how extensive a chatbot’s database of links is or how frequently those links are presented or accessed.” The takeaway: As McBride notes, chatbots are new territory. Publishers and developers should start working together to figure out how they can benefit one another rather than resort to legal action as the first knee-jerk reaction. Read more Kik rethinks chatbots—Kik CEO Ted Livingston notes there hasn’t yet been a “killer bot” despite the thousands that have been built (including more than 20,000 for Kik). One reason, Livingston suggests, is the laser-like focus on human-like conversation. Even without conversation, there is huge utility for using bots, including ease of use (compared to apps), ease of discovery, the ability to use one app to access thousands of chatbots that previously would have required separate apps, and the integration of bots with messaging (that is, a common interface for interaction).  The takeaway: I earlier reported that Silicon valley is hiring writers from Hollywood to write the conversational scripts for chatbots. Don’t feel like you need to take that kind of approach to get started. Providing a more intuitive approach to interactions that currently are available only via your app will be enough to attract consumers who are increasingly agreeable to bots. (As Livingston says, on Kik alone, users have exhanged nearly 2 billion messages with bots in less than four months.) Read more Virtual and Augmented Reality Intel will produce a “merged reality” headset—Intel has thrown its hat in the VR/AR ring with Project Alloy, a wireless headset that will allow users to see their own hands and use them to interact with objects in a Virtual Reality space. Equipped with RealSense cameras, “the headset could detect a user’s finger movement and allow users to manipulate objects within a simulation, thus negating the need for controllers.” The takeaway: Do we really need to factor “merged reality” into the VR/AR mix? Oh, well. The concept is an important one that should create even greater utility for VR uses by businesses and brands that not only want to provide an immersive experience, but encourage real engagement and interaction. Being inside a new-model car is great. Being able to drive it, though, is awesome. Read more Here come celebrity AR holograms—Companies are already working on 3D captures of celebrities for AR and, eventually, VR performances. No word yet on which celebrities are involved, but the idea for now is to “go to a venue and see a convincing virtual concert or lecture no matter where you sit, and with more freedom of movement for the star of the show.” The takeaway: Or feel like you’re at the venue when you’re sitting in your living room in your bathrobe. Read more Video Bye-bye, Blab—For a while there, Blab was all the rage. The livestreaming app attracted nearly 4 million users in its first year, but now it’s gone, the victim of too much churn. Like Meerkat before it, Blab had little trouble attracting broadcasters, but audiences were slow to return to the app. The company plans to reintroduce the tool as a video chat tool for small groups to engage with one another. The takeaway: Some were too quick to proclaim Blab the future of livestreaming. The fact is, the marketplace is crowded and Facebook and Twitter have a lot of clout along with huge existing user bases. I’m not optimistic about Blab’s pivot, either, given that Google Hangouts and Skype already accommodate multi-participant video chat. Read more Mobile/social video on the rise—Smartphones now account for 8.6 of the 50-plus hours we spend looking at screens each week, and social networking accounts for four hours weekly. “The overlap between smartphone and social network use is quite significant, which has led a number of companies to test the viability of social-mobile (SoMo) networks for video delivery,” according to Rapid TV News. SoMo video represents less than 15 minutes of screen time (10% of the time spent on smartphones and 14% of all the time spent watching video on smartphones), but with the shift of screen time to mobile and social networks app embracing video, “all the trends are lining up in favor of massive growth in SoMo video over the next decade,” according to a research analyst. The Diffusion Group forecasts SoMo video will surge from 685 million daily viewing minutes this year to 7.4 billion by 2025. The takeaway: Channel management is a growing occupation. I spoke with the global head of internal communications for a financial services company who just hired a head of channels just for employee communication. Knowing how to produce or repurpose videos for mobile social consumption will be a routine activity in short order. Read more Social platform popularity comes at YouTube’s expense—Sixty-five percent of marketers prefer social channels Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter for digital video campaigns, beating YouTube by 10 percentage points. The study by Trusted Media Brands found 65% of agency respondents and 42% of marketers plan to increase their digital video investment in the next 12 months, and 71% of all respondents could use live-streaming video advertising in the next year. The takeaway: Don’t give up on YouTube, but be strategic on how you use each platform. YouTube is terrible for discovery but great if you can build followers to a channel. Also, social media videos get lost after they move out of the news feed, whereas they remain evergreen on YouTube. Read more Twitter video ads perform best—Take this study with a grain of salt since it was co-produced by Twitter itself, but the same video ad is nearly twice as memorable in a Twitter video feed compared to other premium sites (i.e., Facebook). The study—jointly produced by twitter and IPG Media Lab, showed strong performance of video ads both in the feed and as pre-rolls in other videos. The takeaway: Did I mention you should take this with a grain of salt? Read more Video’s role in purchase decisions gets bigger—Video has become an important consideration in online purchase decisions, according to research from visual commerce company Invodo, whose marketing VP insists that product video is no longer optional. Among the report’s findings: One-third of respondents said they’re more likely to shop on a website other than Amazon when it includes a lot of product videos, shoppers are more likely to watch a video on a product page than anywhere else, and nearly 70% of shoppers say mobile videos allow for impulse shopping. Seventy percent of shoppers also say they rely on online videos to improve their in-store experience.  The takeaway: Must I say it? Especially if your company sells pricier items, offering product videos is a requirement. Read more This week’s wrap image is from Yellowstone National Park’s Flickr account.

SUBSCRIBE Google Local Business Cards or Posts about to roll out to ‘thousands’ of SMBs Search feature will soon be broadly accessible to local businesses. Greg Sterling on August 19, 2016 at 5:50 pm More In March, Google started showing “Local Business Cards” as part of the Google Posts system. This allows content providers or businesses or candidates to control the content that appears in the carousel near the top of search results. Below is an example from the March experimental launch, for Healthy Choice Massage. Now, according to information obtained by Mike Blumenthal, Google will dramatically expand availability of Google Local Posts from a “few dozen” to “thousands” of small businesses. Google Posts was created with mobile users in mind, but they display on PCs as well. Google’s intent is to allow the business owner or marketer (or candidate) to communicate directly with users in search results, including content or information that the Knowledge Panel doesn’t allow. Content is also shareable from within the carousel. When I initially wrote about Local Posts in March, I speculated that it could be quite significant for local SEO — or local visibility, at least. Andrew Shotland did a further analysis with some predictions about who would benefit: Google, savvy local businesses, agencies and spammers. At the time of the initial experiment, Google was uncertain about a broader rollout. That question appears to have been answered by Mike Blumenthal’s Google sources, suggesting the company has seen good results and feedback.

Shares leapt 18.04 percent in the first day of trade, versus the 8.9 percent average first-day performance of this year's IPOs.  Since the IPO, those Class A shares, now traded under the ticker GOOGL, are 1,779 percent higher on a split-adjusted basis at $798.87 a share intraday Friday. That's a market cap of about $543 billion, just shy of Apple (AAPL)'s roughly $588 billion market capitalization.  The deal size for Google's IPO was $1.7 billion.

Google Will Discontinue Chrome Apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux in Early 2018 GO Chrome apps will continue to work on Chrome OS Aug 19, 2016 22:55 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Google has announced today plans to discontinue Chrome apps in early 2018 for Windows, Mac, and Linux users. Chrome apps are self-contained web applications that run inside the Chrome browser, separately from web pages, inside special containers. Google introduced Chrome apps in the Chrome browser in 2010, and they were a moderate success. Chrome apps weren't as successful as everyone thought Developers could create two types of apps, namely hosted and packaged apps. Google says that only 1 percent of all Windows, Mac, and Linux users used packaged apps, which are like self-standing desktop apps that could be launched via Chrome or the Chrome App Launcher (retired last month). As for hosted Chrome apps, Google says that most of them had web-based versions, accessible via any URL and any other browser, so there was no reason to keep a Chrome-specific app just for that. The Google team also justifies its decision to retire Chrome apps by saying that Web-based apps have evolved over the years, and the web provides the necessary tools for developers to create web-based apps as powerful as the Chrome apps. Since Chrome apps were created in 2010, the W3C has released HTML5, CSS3, and approved a ton of APIs that support service workers, web push notifications, better multimedia playback, and tons more. Additionally, the once frozen-over JavaScript standard has also received two major updates. The deprecation timeline Starting late 2016, Google says that newly published Chrome apps will only be available to Chrome OS users, but not Windows, Mac, and Linux. Users will be able to access, use and update existing Chrome apps. From the second half of 2017, users won't be able to access Chrome apps on the Chrome Web Store if they're using Windows, Mac, or Linux. Beginning with early 2018, users will not be able to load any type of Chrome apps, except on Chrome OS. Chrome apps still play a central role in Chrome OS, Google's browser-based OS that comes installed on all Chromebook devices. Google's Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, VP Product Management, says that Chrome apps will continue to work on Chrome OS "for the foreseeable future." #Chrome apps#Google#Chrome#Google Chrome#Chrome OS subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Working on New OS That's Not Android, Chrome OS, or Linux-Related Google Will Kill Flash in Chrome by the End of the Year Firefox 48 Released with Multi-Process Support, Mandatory Add-On Signing Opera 39 Comes with Video and Search Pop Out Feature, Personalized Newsreader iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    Chrome apps in the Google Chrome browser Related Apps SkyHistory: Record and save your Skype chat history and call logs with this application that offers contact management and bookmarking of important messages Outlook4Gmail: Synchronize your Outlook and Gmail accounts by transferring all the important data like contacts and calendar events between them Emby Server: A media server that you can use to organize your entire video, audio and photo collection and access it remotely from multiple devices WebSite Auditor: Enable on-page optimization for your website and assure its place in the top rankings of Google thanks to this comprehensive SEO program Betternet: Navigate the Internet anonymously or with a different IP address and get the opportunity to visit any website, using this VPN server application SEO SpyGlass: Monitor and manage the backlinks for your website in order to increase its online popularity and overall visibility, with the help of this handy tool Rank Tracker: Monitor your website's search engine rankings with the help of this comprehensive and reliable application, dedicated to webmasters Reader comments Load old comments   Twitter Down for Some Users - Update: It's Back more on: Twitter i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Search for: Welcome Philosophy Services What Sets Us Apart Client Letters Blog Contact Us Leading Tech Companies All Chasing The Same “Next Big Things” August 16, 2016 10:23 AM | Leave a Comment | Chad Brand I miss the old days of tech investing. Times were simpler. Companies were more focused. There were one or two companies that tended to be dominant within a certain fragment of the industry. Google was search and online advertising. Amazon was e-commerce. Intel was chips. eBay was marketplace. Microsoft was operating systems and productivity software. Cisco was networking. Apple was high-end devices. Facebook was social networking. Netflix was movies. You get the picture. Oh how times have changed. The tech landscape now has led us down a different path. Each of these companies has been extremely successful in conquering their home turf. They are all wildly profitable and have more money than they know what to do with. So they repurchase shares and pay dividends and buy startups to add talent and new technology. And after they do all of that they still have billions of dollars extra sitting around. What to do? It appears the answer now is to become a tech conglomerate. Heck, if we took over one area of the marketplace, why not shoot for the stars? Why not be everything to everybody? So now when we talk about the leading tech companies (Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft) the future looks far less predictable. In the old world Tesla would be the de facto electric self-driving car play. But Google is building cars. So is Apple. In the old world Oculus would have been the virtual/augmented reality play. But in the new world Facebook acquires them and then Microsoft and Apple and Google all start working on the same thing. In the old world Netflix would be the benchmark for streaming video. Nobody would argue that households looking to get rid of their $100/month cable bills would substitute them with a half dozen individual services that cost $10-$20 per month. The expensive cable bundle is no worse than a bundle of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, HBO Now, YouTube Red, and CBS All Access. And as if there are not enough competitors vying for your TV dollars, it was recently reported that Apple has decided it has identified the next big thing; producing original TV content. Are you kidding me? I understand that self-driving cars and streaming over-the-top video and virtual reality could all very well be huge markets over the long term. But everyone can’t be a winner. Do you really think GM and Ford lack the ability to produce self-driving, electric cars? Are the Big Three auto makers going to be replaced by Apple, Google, and Tesla a decade from now? Are we really going to cancel our Comcast service and pay the same amount of money for less content by buying subscriptions to 6 or 8 streaming services? The leading tech companies got to where they are today by being laser-focused on creating or improving upon one big tech trend. Becoming indispensable in that arena has made them billions of dollars and created a ton of shareholder wealth. They did not win out after a long, brutal battle with the other tech titans at the time. The biggest risk to Apple, for example, is that the innovation they are focused on revolves solely around virtual reality, electric cars, and streaming TV and movies. That is not how Apple became Apple. And it is not the secret for them to stay at the top. The same goes for Google and Microsoft and Facebook. As long as these companies are battling against each other, as opposed to paving their own way to the future, I am afraid that those of us hoping for the next big thing to come out of the mega tech stalwarts may be disappointed. To truly develop a market-leading position you have to try something new and do so long before everyone else. Nobody is likely to catch Amazon in the public cloud computing space (although Google and Microsoft are trying, of course). They are years ahead because they saw the trend before anyone else and went all-in to the number one. Enjoy this post?

Here's how much you would have made if you'd invested in Google at its IPO Jillian D'Onfro Aug. 19, 2016, 6:33 PM 176,597 facebook linkedin twitter email print Here's the crew at the IPO. Cofounder Sergey Brin stayed in Mountain View that day because he didn't want to take a red-eye flight to New York.Getty Images Google went public exactly 12 years ago today, August 19. In the immediate aftermath, employees who made big money were warned not to buy BMWs (or else they'd get their windshields smashed) or check the stock ticker at work (or else they'd have to buy the person who caught them a share). People who bought shares on August 19, 2004, and kept it have made off well, as the stock price of Google and parent company Alphabet has skyrocketed. If you bought one share of Google in 2004 at its initial public offering price of $85, then it would be two shares worth $1,575 today, taking into account Google's stock split. That's a stunning 1,752.94% change, or about 18.5x. So, let's assume that you bought more than one share: If you bought about $1,000 of stock — about 11.76 shares — at the IPO price in 2004, then you'd have about $18,522 today. If you'd invested $10,000, then you'd have $185,384.53, a gain of $175,384. If you'd been high-rolling with a $100,000 investment, then you'd have a stunning $1,853,022.60. Not too shabby. Although the company has changed tremendously in the past 12 years — there are now separate divisions for self-driving cars, curing death, and improving cities — the core search experience looks pretty much the same. Thanks to The Internet Archive, we can revisit those early days and see exactly what Google used to look like: View As: One Page Slides If you went to Google.com in 1997, here's what you'd see: The Way Back Machine / Google The first of the two links would take you here: The Way Back Machine / Google The link called "might-work-some-of-the-time-prototype that is much more up to date" would take you to this page: The Way Back Machine / Google By December, that was the official home page, and if you navigated your way to "Help!" then you'd get this explanation: The Way Back Machine / Google That early site also had some fun, user-submitted logos, too: The Way Back Machine / Google And pics of what were, apparently, old logos that the company used: The Way Back Machine / Google Larry Page and Sergey Brin made the first Google Doodle in August 1998. They were heading to Burning Man in the Nevada desert and wanted people to know where the Google crew would be for a few days, so they added the festival's logo. Google By mid-1999, Google had simplified its home page: The Way Back Machine / Google We got our first look at non-beta Google in October 1999: The Way Back Machine Only minor updates in mid-2000, as Google adds a few links: The Way Back Machine / Google By the end of the year, though, Google finally centered its logo and started promoting its ad program: The Way Back Machine / Google By the end of the year, Google already offered 25 different language options — it now offers 80: The Way Back Machine / Google In 2001, the home page looks largely the same, but other parts of the site are more fleshed out. Here's the culture page: The Way Back Machine / Google It added different tabs in 2001: The Way Back Machine / Google Google ditched the blue boxes in 2004: The Way Back Machine / Google Everything stayed pretty much the same, until Google moved its different search options up top: The Way Back Machine / Google Google ditched the ugly shadowing on its font in 2010: The Way Back Machine / Google In 2011, it added a black box around its top toolbar: The Way Back Machine / Google Google updated to a simpler, more elegant logo in 2013: The Way Back Machine / Google Shortly after the company blew up its corporate structure in August 2015, forming Alphabet, the company modernized its look.

Advertising versus the tech industry Cremona explained the differences he has found between his 25 years of advertising experience to that of working with Google, which he deemed “an engineer’s company, not an advertising agency.” “I thought I knew everything about mobile, but then I realised that in advertising, we are very good at becoming experts in any field within 24 hours – but we do that very superficially. Whereas Google goes much deeper into their work.” © Gallo Images Cremona also spoke highly of Google's flat structure, a strategy known as ‘management on the edge of chaos’, that challenged the hierarchical structure he had experienced in advertising. He explained that pyramids in companies can lend to people refusing to do work based on it not being part of their contract, whereas Google’s approach increased productivity. “Another thing I like about the flat structure approach is that because of the consensus that needs to be reached in order to approve an idea, you really need to be passionate and motivated about your idea in order to see it through.” Cremano then shared Google’s creative mantras with the audience, which also differed greatly from his experience of advertising: • The product is the idea • Users above all • Demos and documentaries, not ads. To this point, Cremano mentioned, “This destroyed me, because one of the most beautiful things in my ad years was using fantasy to create worlds that didn’t exist.” • Make people smile, cry or think The challenges of mobile The first challenge regarding mobile that Cremona highlighted was that people’s attention span has decreased since the year 2000 from 12 seconds to eight seconds. Cremona offered the following solution: “You need to find a way to communicate to people relevantly in the micro moments (those three seconds they take to go online on their phone).” According to Cremona, ad blocking poses the second challenge to mobile advertisers. “What ad blocking says to me is that people are not happy with the kind of advertising that is on mobile today. The average click-through rate of display ads is 0.06%. It means that most probably, the 0.06% of people that ended up watching the ads could not find the X button to close them, because it was too small.” One further challenge was around what platform one should use in one’s campaign. “Every day is not only a creative struggle, it’s a media struggle. You have to know what channels are relevant to people and know how to use these in a relevant way,” explains Cremona. Make brands relevant Cremona made the point that in order to engage an audience in a relevant way, brands need to adapt international brands to gain local insights. Cremona likened speaking a global language in places where you should actually ‘speak local’ to trying to pick up sushi with billiard sticks. “It’s very difficult and not always successful,” he says. He provided the example of an international campaign showing Sesame Street's Cookie Monster, well-known to American audiences. The campaign reached fourteen countries, but Cremona felt it could’ve been improved. “As much as the campaign was amusing, had they used a character that was recognised by the local market, such as Cheburashka who is an equivalent in Russia, they would’ve been more relevant,” says Cremona. Cremona ended the seminar with a captivating campaign that raised awareness around disabled parking bays in Russia by displaying a hologram before non-disabled drivers requesting that they respect drivers with disabilities and find another parking bay. “Work really has to have an effect on people’s lives, such as the work created for Dislife.ru which turned a flat sign into a real person.” View the campaign below: ‹    Like Save Email Print PDF Advertisement Follow Connect (Pasqua Heard knows me) Colleague Weve done business together Weve worked together Met in person Interacted with online Classmate Friend Family Follow only Create new group Pasqua Heard's articles About Pasqua HeardEditorial Assistant at Bizcommunity Comment on thisComment Comment guidelines and disclaimer LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards (e.g. defamation, slander, or other such crimes).

Infosec duo exploits OCR flaw to nab a website's HTTPS cert AT&T wants Time Warner Google has asked a US court to stop a former MySpace investor from repeatedly filing suit against it. The web advertising giant this week told (PDF) the US District Court for Northern California that Brad Greenspan has been burdening its lawyers and racking up its legal bills by constantly filing motions in a lawsuit that was dismissed more than a year ago. Greenspan, who held a key role during the genesis of MySpace, was a 10 per cent shareholder in the social network when it was acquired by Rupert Murdoch's NewsCorp in 2005. He has long claimed that the $580m sale price was too low. In 2014, he sued Google, claiming the Chocolate Factory helped to delay sale to NewsCorp and drive down the selling price. Specifically, Greenspan accused Google of using a no-poaching deal with Yahoo! and Ask.com to get both competitors to back off bids to provide search services for MySpace, in the process driving down the site's potential value. "News Corp was able to purchase MySpace at a severe discount by purchasing MySpace during a time when Google was withholding a bid for exclusive search engine contract, and when [MySpace board member Geoff] Yang and [board member Geoff] Carlick directed MySpace not to renew an exclusive search engine contract with Yahoo or any other search engine in exchange for Google’s agreement not to poach Ask.com’s employees," Greenspan's original complaint reads. The case was dismissed by the court on May 15, 2015. Google argued that, since that ruling, Greenspan has filed motions to appeal with the court 16 times. After the judge struck down the motion to appeal in May of this year, Google says it has received seven more motions from Greenspan. Those motions include claims that errors such as incorrect dates (PDF) and improperly filled out forms (PDF) by Google and IAC's lawyers should allow the case to continue. "None of these post-judgment filings do anything but try to advance his dismissed claims," Google argues in the filing. "Indeed, Greenspan is simply (and blatantly) ignoring the court’s orders and needlessly burdening the Court and the parties with wholly unnecessary and unwarranted motion practice." In total, the Chocolate Factory estimates that dealing with Greenspan's constant filings have cost it $21,793.50 in legal fees, money it wants repaid along with an order barring Greenspan from filing further motions without first obtaining court permission. Google also notes Greenspan's previous attempts to either file or intervene in four other suits related to the MySpace acquisition. He also attempted to intervene in the 2014 Silicon Valley wage-fixing suit. "Google does not file this motion lightly, but enough is enough," the complaint reads. "The time has come for the Court to deem Greenspan a vexatious litigant and constrain his ability to file any further pleadings in this closed case." El Reg was unable to reach Greenspan for comment, but we'll update this story if we hear from him. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 18 Comments More from The Register David Bowie: Musician, actor... tech admirer Obituary The muso was the medium 50 Comments The Bong Diaries, Pt.94: Bowie, Martha... and where's my knighthood? ¡Bong!

The Moto X, unlike other Android flagships at the time, was not a specs hero but instead offered lean, effective software and the ability to personalize the device through Motomaker. The Moto X defined the company’s time as an extension of Mountain View; fun and vibrant, but it wasn’t enough. In 2014, Google pulled the plug on the Motorola experiment and sold the company to Chinese tech giant Lenovo. We had to wait several years to see what affect the new ownership would have, and in 2016 we finally have our answer with the Moto Z. Like the Moto X it replaces, the Z defines the company’s time under its new owners, and Lenovo has certainly made its mark. The first “Lenovorola” product does away with everything the company forged under Google. And that’s not a bad thing. A New Era The Moto X, and its various successors, were great phones but the Moto Z forges its own path, starting with the hardware. Gone is the colorful, customizable design of the X in favor of a more vanilla modern smartphone look. It’s made of metal and glass, looks sharp and collects fingerprints like a monster. To spice up the aesthetics, Motorola opted to make this the thinnest smartphone on the market. At just 5.19mm, it’s ridiculously, ludicrously, slim. So svelte, in fact, it’s not hyperbolic to call it “impossibly thin.”A phone this tiny shouldn’t exist, has no reason to, but the Z makes a better effort at contextualizing its size than most phones. The real compelling aspect of the device are the swappable, snapable accessories, dubbed Moto Mods, that give the phone a modular lean. These add-ons offer various improvements, like more battery, a better speaker, even a projector, but they also add a significant amount of depth. Reducing the initial size helps offset the added bulk of the Mods. It’s a decent argument, until you consider that Motorola is simultaneously releasing a thicker version of the phone, the Moto Z Force, that comes in at around 7mm. That fact dwindles the Z’s impressive profile to nothing more than novelty. If it doesn’t offer any real benefit, the 5.19mm frame is at least striking, but I also found it to reduce the phone’s comfort level. It’s simply too thin to feel good in the hand, like a lover that’s all elbows and knees. It doesn’t feel fragile, Motorola did an impeccable job with construction and the Z is solid enough to take a tumble or two. It just doesn’t feel like it wants to be in your hand like phones (i.e. the Moto X) that have invitingly curved backs. During my test period, I preferred to have a Style Shell snapped to the back of the Moto Z. Style Shells keep the spirit of Motomaker alive by offering a handful of affordable backs that give users different looks to apply to the Z. The best part, though, is that they fill out the phone, removing the camera bump and making the device more comfortable to hold. It’s like a sandwich, but for your phone. High-end smartphones have gotten so close to one another in recent years from a hardware perspective, that comparing them is like splitting hairs that have already been split. Most feature gorgeous QHD displays that are a joy to look at, and the Z is no different. It’s 5.5-inch 1440P screen comes with a ppi of 535 and looks fantastic no matter the situation. The vibrant colors of Rayman Adventures pop, YouTube videos look as crispy as they ought to and photos are rendered beautifully. If you were to nitpick, Motorola’s latest wouldn’t stand up to the best display on the market, which many give to the latest Galaxy phones, but if you’re none the wiser the display will satisfy wholly. The 5.5-inch size feels more demure than it is, thanks to the phone’s waistline obsession, but not every aspect of the device handles its size well. The biggest culprit are the array of buttons, which sit far too high on the phone’s right hand side. For someone with smaller hands, it was an annoyance to stretch my thumb to reach them and, furthering the frustration, Motorola opted to separate the volume up and down buttons rather than utilize a rocker. Because all three buttons are the same size and sit incredibly high on the frame, it was easy to confuse them. Luckily, I didn’t have to use the buttons much thanks to the Moto Z’s fingerprint scanner. While I dislike the square shape, which doesn’t fit the rest of the phone’s sleek aesthetic, the scanner performs incredibly well. Easily outpacing the reader on my Nexus 6P, it’s accurate and blazingly fast. It is just a fingerprint scanner, though, not a home button of any sort. This has driven several other reviewers mad, but I was able to quickly compartmentalize that the on-screen home button was the only home button because the fingerprint scanner became my de facto locking method. A small, but handy, feature lets users lock the phone with the fingerprint reader, something I now wish all companies would implement. Given the hand acrobatics necessary for me to use the actual lock button, I usually defaulted to using the scanner. Hit the Road, Jack The biggest losers to the Moto Z’s starring role on The Biggest Loser are audioheads. The Z is one of the first phones to ditch the headphone jack, a move that is grossly premature and reminds me of Samsung’s original Galaxy Gear, which the company dumped upon the world months before the Apple Watch was released merely to be first out of the gates. In Samsung’s case, the subpar wearable led to far more clever, and genuinely impressive hardware. That’s a best case scenario with this phone, but if Cupertino does kill the headphone jack, you can be assured the Z’s successor won’t backslide. I fully expected to be enraged by the lack of a headphone jack, only to find that I am the perfect user for a phone without one. I often work from home and thus listen to music through my computer or connect my phone to a Bluetooth speaker. When I do commute, it’s on foot to a destination only 15 minutes away, not nearly enough time to dig into music or a podcast. If I do listen to music on a walk or during a workout, I have Bluetooth headphones I can use. I didn’t miss the headphone jack. Not for a single second. But just because the Moto Z’s lack of a 3.5mm input was fine for me doesn’t mean Motorola and Lenovo are just in removing it. In the 21st century, smartphones have become extensions of our bodies; limbs made of Gorilla Glass. The idea of one without the ability to easily play music through headphones you already own is unthinkable, and more than enough reason to pass it by. Motorola attempts to ease those with concerns by putting a USB-C to headphone jack dongle in the box. It works, but also makes you feel like the silliest goober in the world. The truth is that, without a new standard in place, it was too early to remove the headphone jack. This isn’t Apple killing the floppy disk, this is Motorola trying to cut the lunch line. As stated above, the most interesting aspect of the Moto Z is not the thinness of its body, but what you can attach to its back. Like the LG G5, the “modularity” here is surface-level, at best. Sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of the Moto Mods first hand, beyond the Style Shell, but the system is not hard to grasp and that’s the beauty of it. Mods snap onto the back of the phone with the help of strong magnets and the gold 16-pin connector. There’s no need to reboot the phone, and there’s clever software at work that makes the device recognize Mods as an extension of itself rather than an accessory. It’s the best swing at a modular phone yet, but the whole concept still has issues. Mods are not cheap, adding $60-300 on top of a device that is already $624, or $720 for the Z Force. There’s also no guarantee third-party manufacturers will buy into the ecosystem, though there is more support for Motorola’s implementation at the outset than what LG had. At this point, modular smartphones still feel like the fad of 2016, but Motorola’s idea has some legs. If the company pushes it, and can get well-respected manufacturers to build Mods, it could define the company’s flagship devices for years. That’s the meat of the story for the Moto Z. It’s really thin, and has funky accessories that snap onto the back. It’s completely different than the Moto X, but also approaches the smartphone market with a similar sense of individuality. The Z is more in tune with the gimmick of the era, but does it in a way that feels legitimate and clever, like Motorola has done for decades.

Based on screenshots obtained by Android Police, Allo will give users the option to select a message and permanently delete it from the chat’s history. This functionality has been seen in other chat apps in the past such as Slack, and it really proves useful when you spell something wrong or say something that you probably shouldn’t have. Unfortunately, that’s not how deleting a message works on Allo. Deleting a message will make it disappear on your device, but the recipient will still see it. The only way to delete a message completely is to delete it before it has been delivered on the recipient’s device. The screenshots also reveal that you’ll be able to share a message, forward it to another chat, and copy the message’s contents. You’ll also be able to perform these same actions, including deletion, on messages you’ve received. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Along with this, Android Police has also received screenshots showing off various stickers from Allo, and they’re pretty hilarious. A few packs are pre-loaded and more are available to add on later. All of these packs include about 24 different stickers which are each custom designed. You’ll be able to see the first 24 packs, which are apparently pre-loaded with Allo, in the gallery below, but be warned that some are NSFW. Oh, and don’t forget that many of these are animated, only adding to the fun. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Things could, of course, change before Allo’s official release. I’d assume that some of these sticker packs might not be pre-loaded in the final release, for obvious reasons. It’s still unclear when Allo will release, but seeing that Duo is already out, it’s probably not too far off. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

Chrome apps, like Hangouts and Google Keep, were launched three years ago due to the web lacking offline capabilities, notifications, and connecting to hardware. With the open web now having enough of those features, Google is beginning the “evolution away from the Chrome apps platforms.” These changes only apply to the Chrome browser on Mac, Windows, and Linux. According to Google, packaged and hosted Chrome apps will continue functioning on Chromebooks for the foreseeable future. New features to the Chrome apps platform will apply only to Chrome OS devices, with developers still being able to build for that platform. Google notes that only 1% of those on Windows, Mac, and Linux actually use Chrome packaged apps. In late 2016, newly-published Chrome apps will only be available to Chrome OS users. Existing Chrome apps will continue to work on all platforms. However, by the second half of 2017, the Chrome Web Store will only show extensions and themes for Mac, Windows, and Linux users. In early 2018, those platforms will no longer be able to load Chrome apps. Developers are encouraged to migrate their Chrome apps to the web, while Google encourages devs to help them prioritize which APIs are still needed. Overall, this transition period should be long enough for most users to find suitable replacements for their favorite apps.

Google Chrome supports web browser extensions and so-called Chrome apps. Google launched Chrome apps three years ago to deliver experiences the Web could not provide. Chrome Apps for the most part started out as simple bookmarks that would bring users to web services. The apps evolved later on and some made use of functionality such as offline access or other features eventually. Web standards evolved since the introduction of Chrome apps support in Chrome and Chrome OS, with web technologies becoming more powerful in the process. Google to retire Chrome Apps Google looked at Chrome apps, and how many users of Chrome on Windows, Mac and Linux were used packaged apps actively. According to Google, about 1% of desktop Chrome users make use of Chrome packaged apps. Taking this and the improvements in web standards into account, the company made the decision to retire packaged and hosted apps from all desktop Chrome versions over the next two years. Today, approximately 1% of users on Windows, Mac and Linux actively use Chrome packaged apps, and most hosted apps are already implemented as regular web apps. We will be removing support for packaged and hosted apps from Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Linux over the next two years Chrome apps will remain supported on Chrome OS however for the "foreseeable future". Google did not go into details, and it is unclear for how long Chrome OS will keep on supporting these apps. All types of Chrome apps will remain supported and maintained on Chrome OS for the foreseeable future. Additional enhancements to the Chrome apps platform will apply only to Chrome OS devices, including kiosks. Developers can continue to build Chrome apps (or Android apps) for Chrome OS. The following schedule is used to retire Chrome apps for all desktop platforms: Late 2016: New Chrome apps will only be available to users on Chrome OS. Existing Chrome apps remain accessible, and developers may continue to update them. Second half of 2017: Chrome apps are not longer displayed when users open the Chrome Web Store on Windows, Mac or Linux versions of Chrome. Extensions and themes remain visible in the web store. Early 2018: Users on Windows, Mac or Linux devices may no longer load Chrome apps. Google encourages developers to migrate Chrome apps to the Web. The company suggests that developers who cannot migrate their apps to the web fully help Google prioritize new APIs to "fill the gaps left by Chrome apps". Now You: Do you use Chrome apps actively?

That's why I don't rely too much in google ecosystem. I bet their new apps Allo and Duo will face the same fate! Reply Koko August 20, 2016 at 7:56 am # No more ad block???? I'll go to Mozilla....

Love it! ;) Reply Rott Weiller August 20, 2016 at 11:00 am # chrome apps = google os apps as far as i know, so think twice before buying a new chromebook as you may find yourself using chrome and chrome only because of retiring all apps :( ps. not using that idiotic laptops, and always removing the apps from chrome - so no problem on my side Reply RPWheeler August 20, 2016 at 12:38 pm # I do not use actively neither Chrome, nor Chrome apps. I use Chrome for some web apps where Javascript performance matters a lot, but for apps I prefer something browser-independent, also I prefer to have browser one-click restart capability, which Chrome does not have. Reply Heimen Stoffels August 21, 2016 at 1:09 pm # There's Chrome extensions for one-click restart. Reply Dave August 20, 2016 at 1:55 pm # Is there any reason a Chromium fork can't support Chrome apps and even update the feature via the Chrome OS updates? Reply Heimen Stoffels August 21, 2016 at 1:12 pm # You can't install a different browser or core OS feature on ChromeOS so it can't be distributed via the updates. A fork for other platforms could support Chrome apps but the apps are going to be removed from the Chrome Web Store next year so there's no way to install them. Unless said fork creates an extensions website (or section, in case they already have an extensions website) with a Chrome apps section. But then devs need to migrate their apps from the Chrome Web Store to said new website.

Fossil Q Wander Smartwatch Has Appealing Features, Traditional Flair The Fossil Q Wander may look like a traditional watch, but it's an Android Wear-based smartwatch that works with both iOS and Android mobile devices. It Fits Into the Fossil Watch Design Tradition Fossil hasn't strayed from its roots with the Q Wander's design. The device has a round face and looks nearly identical to some of its traditional watches. Users also will find Fossil's own wristbands and a dial on the side. Absent a closer look, one might be fooled into believing the Q Wander is a traditional watch. It's Powered by Android Wear Google's Android Wear powers the Q Wander, giving users full access to the operating system's slate of features, including support for countless watch faces, alerts to texts and much more. Android Wear generally has been well-received in the marketplace, which makes Fossil's decision to go with the operating system a smart one. Q Wander Works Across Platforms The Q Wander won't only work with Android-based devices. In fact, Fossil said the smartwatch will notify users of calls, texts and other notifications on iPhone 5 or newer iPhones running iOS 8 or up. On the Android side, the device requires Android 4.3 or higher. The Battery Will Last All Day Fossil has promised somewhat solid battery life in the Q Wander, saying it will last for 24 hours on a single charge before it needs to be powered up. That's only an estimate, though, and Fossil was quick to note that heavier usage could drain the battery more quickly. Either way, expect to charge the Q Wander at night. There Are Plenty of Activity Tracking Features In addition to telling time, the Q Wander is a fitness tracker that comes bundled with several sensors that can track a person's steps, distance traveled and calories burned. Despite that, surprisingly the smartwatch doesn't come with a heart rate sensor for tracking a person's pulse. Find Built-In Wireless Connectivity The Fossil Q Wander comes with WiFi built-in. With WiFi connectivity, users can control apps such as Apple Music or Spotify directly from the watch face. In addition, users don't always need to have their smartphones in their pockets to get notifications. WiFi integration in smartwatches has nearly become a requirement in today's mobile marketplace, and it's nice to see it in the Q Wander. Getting a Sense of the Fossil Q Wander's Size With so many shapes and variations available, a smartwatch's size should be considered before making a purchase. The Q Wander has a case size of 45mm and features support for all types of 22mm straps. To put that into perspective, the popular LG Watch Urbane has a 46mm face with a 22mm band, making them nearly identical in size. It Supports Wireless Data Synchronization and Charging Fossil's Q Wander is all about going wireless. In addition to WiFi networking, the device comes with wireless synchronization, allowing users to transfer data over Bluetooth between smartphone and smartwatch. The smartwatch ships with a conductive magnetic charger, which means that it supports wireless charging. Pick From Several Watchband Options Thanks to an "interchangeable design," the Q Wander is compatible with any 22mm strap, Fossil says. The company is currently selling four Q Wander variants, starting with a sports-friendly black silicone strap, along with a light brown leather strap. Customers also can choose a stainless steel wristband or a rose gold-tone stainless bracelet. Preorder Now and Get It Later As of this writing, the Fossil Q Wander is available for preorder through the Fossil website. The device is slated to ship on Aug. 29. When it does, customers will find the leather, silicone and stainless-steel versions all cost $295. The rose gold-tone stainless version will be priced at $315.

The Apple Watch is the most popular smartwatch in the world, while Google is the creator of Android Wear, a mobile operating system that runs on an increasing number of wearable computers. Traditional watchmakers, meanwhile, view the smartwatch market as new, desirable territory for them. These watchmakers often rely on Android Wear to bring new smartwatch designs to the market, and the Fossil Q Wander is one of the latest smartwatches to fit that mold. The device, which comes with a round face, runs on Android Wear and delivers several appealing features, including Bluetooth support, wireless charging, and the ability to work with both iOS and Android mobile devices. It's also an attractive smartwatch that won't break the bank with its $295 starting price. This slide show discusses the Fossil Q Wander's key features and why the device, which is scheduled to go on sale at the end of August, could be a nice option for people looking for a smartwatch that reflects a more traditional watch design heritage.                       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend                             Topics by Type Android Apple Cloud Database Developer Enterprise Apps Innovation IT Management   Mobile Networking PC Hardware Security Servers Small Business Storage Virtualization Articles by Type News & Analysis Slideshows Blogs Reviews Video   Contact Us About eWeek Sitemap Blogs Security Watch Upfront First Read Storage Station Careers Google Watch Special Features eWeekChat eWeek 30th Anniversary Cloud Backup Project Center Next Generation Firewall Project Center Big Data Analytics Project Center Research Center       Property of QuinStreet Enterprise.

AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among members of the "Robocall Strike Force" that held its first meeting with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The strike force will report to the FCC by Oct. 19 on "concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions," said AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson, chairman of the group. The strike force hopes to implement Caller ID verification standards to help block calls from spoofed phone numbers and consider a "Do Not Originate" list that would block spoofers from impersonating legitimate phone numbers from governments, banks or others. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in July urged major companies to take new action to block robocalls, which often come from telemarketers or scam artists. "This scourge must stop," Wheeler said on Friday, calling robocalls the No. 1 complaint from consumers. "The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology," Wheeler said. In the past, he has said robocalls continue "due in large part to industry inaction." Stephenson emphasized "the breadth and complexity" of the problem. "This is going to require more than individual company initiatives and one-off blocking apps," Stephenson said. "Robocallers are a formidable adversary, notoriously hard to stop." The FCC does not require robocall blocking and filtering but has strongly encouraged phone service providers to offer those services at no charge. The strike force brings together carriers, device makers, operating system developers, network designers and the government. "We have to come out of this with a comprehensive play book for all of us to go execute," Stephenson said. "We have calls that are perfectly legal, but unwanted, like telemarketers and public opinion surveyors. At the other end of the spectrum, we have millions of calls that are blatantly illegal." Stephenson said technical experts representing the companies have had "preliminary conversations about short- and longer-term initiatives." Joan Marsh, AT&T vice president of federal regulatory issues, called the problem complicated. "We have been wrangling with this problem long enough to know there is no silver bullet," she said. "Nothing by itself is going to do it." Other companies taking part include Blackberry Ltd, British Telecommunications Plc, Charter Communications Inc, Frontier Communications, LG Electronics Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nokia Corp , Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , Sirius XM Holdings Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and U.S. Cellular Corp. Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said the task force is a sign "phone companies are taking more serious steps to protect their customers from unwanted calls."

Roston - Aug 19, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If you’re a Windows, Mac or Linux user, the odds are really, really low that you’re also a Chrome apps user. According Google, only about one percent of the users on those platforms are ‘actively’ utilizing packaged Chrome apps, and so as you probably guessed, there’s not much sense in continuing support for them. For this reason, Google has decided that all new Chrome apps published starting later this year will only be available on Chrome OS; support for existing apps for Mac, Windows and Linux will be phased out over the next couple of years. Chrome apps launched three years ago, and while they’re okay for Chromebooks, there’s not much of a point to them on Windows and Mac devices. Google says it is time to evolve away from the Chrome apps platform, though, and that means shedding its dead weight: all the Linux, Windows, and Mac users who aren’t using the apps. Over the next two years, support for both hosted apps and packaged apps from Chrome will be nixed. More immediately, though, will be the inaccessibility of new Chrome apps for these users — sometime later this year (on an unspecified date), all Chrome apps published on and after that date won’t be available to Windows, Mac and Linux users. You will be able to get and use them if you have a Chromebook, though. Some time in the second half of 2017, Windows, Mac and Linux users will no longer see Chrome apps in the Chrome Web Stores, instead only having access to the themes and extensions. Finally, in the early part of 2018, the trio of platforms will not be able to load any Chrome apps, marking the final end to a long process.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Google is killing Chrome apps on Windows, Mac, and Linux Chrome OS will remain supported "for the foreseeable future." by Andrew Cunningham - Aug 19, 2016 7:55 pm UTC Login to bookmark Enlarge / Chrome apps running on an older version of Chrome OS. Andrew Cunningham Chrome OS has become a low-key success story for Google in the last few years. Because they're relatively cheap and easy to track and manage, Chromebooks has made inroads in businesses and educational institutions. But Chrome OS still has a big shortcoming compared to Windows and macOS: an app gap. To help close that gap and augment Web apps, Google introduced the Chrome apps platform to let developers make Web apps that looked and functioned more like traditional standalone apps. Part of Google's sales pitch was that Chrome apps were universal—without any additional effort from developers, these apps would run not just on Chrome OS, but also any Windows, Mac, or Linux PC with Chrome installed. The Chrome apps platform was an interesting experiment, but it has apparently failed. In a blog post today, Google said that "approximately 1 percent" of all Chrome users on Windows, Mac, and Linux were using Chrome apps. Arguing that Web standards have continued to evolve and become more capable and that the company is simplifying Chrome, Google says that support for Chrome apps on non-Chrome OS platforms will be phased out over the next two years. Extensions and themes will remain available on all platforms. Later this year, any new Chrome apps that are published will only be available to Chrome OS users, though existing apps can continue to be updated. "In the second half of 2017," Windows, Mac, and Linux users won't be able to see Chrome apps in the Chrome Web Store. And "in early 2018," non-Chrome OS platforms will lose the ability to load Chrome apps altogether. The company says that Chrome apps will remain supported and maintained on Chrome OS "for the foreseeable future." Google will even continue to work on and improve the Chrome apps platform for Chrome OS devices. But given that Android apps are coming to Chrome OS and that Chrome apps are being killed on every other platform, their future doesn't look bright.

Did Google Rip Off This Viral Japanese Ad from 2015? By Patrick Coffee on Aug. 19, 2016 - 3:29 PMComment It’s time for another round of “Is It Plagiariasm, Or…?” Earlier this week, an anonymous tipster sent us this 2015 ad for Japanese internet service provider Plala. It’s a nicely done piece, and it’s unlike many American ads in that you have to wait a minute for the payoff. OK, that was pretty cool. The ad went viral in Japan, and it was also briefly referenced in a more than slightly insane ramen spot that went up last week. Fast forward to earlier this month, when Google debuted a new spot promoting its “Free Up Space” service, which was created to avoid the very sort of problems encountered by the school girls in the ad above. It depicts a bunch of situations that are conceptually identical to the one in the Plala ad but executed in a far more rapid way. The style is different but the hook is the same — and it’s not one we’d seen before. (It’s not clear whether this one was by an outside shop or Google’s in-house team, but a lack of attribution points to the latter.) Our tipster wrote earlier this week: “Don’t let Google get away with plagiarizing someone else’s creative work. For what its worth, I’m a firm believer that there’s a certain level of ethics that should be followed when producing creative. This includes not stealing others’ work. And in this situation, with complete disregard for these ethics Google directly lifted another brand’s creative work to pass as their own. Can they not afford to produce original creative? Or are they just LAZY?” We feel like he has a point, even if we’ve seen more blatant ripoffs during our tenure at this here web site. Maybe a good thing that the bodybuilding guy in the Google spot didn’t finish his video, though. He seemed destined to experience a very painful fall.

AdSense network, but Google's protections should be keeping users safe. New research from Kaspersky Lab identified a variant of the Svpeng mobile banking Trojan being delivered to Android devices without any user interaction necessary. Mikhail Kuzin and Nikita Buchka, malware analysts for Kaspersky Lab, based in Moscow, described the finding in a blog post. "There you are, minding your own business, reading the news and BOOM! -- no additional clicks or following links required. It turns out the malicious program is downloaded via the Google AdSense advertising network ... anyone can register their ad on this network -- they just need to pay a fee. And it seems that didn't deter the authors of the Svpeng Trojan from pushing their creation via AdSense. The Trojan is downloaded as soon as a page with the advert is visited." The Svpeng banking Trojan was first discovered in mid-2014. Kuzin and Buchka wrote it "can steal information about the user's bank cards via phishing windows, [as well as] intercept, delete and send text messages," and it "collects an impressive amount of information from the user's phone -- the call history, text and multimedia messages, browser bookmarks and contacts." Although the Trojan app is silently delivered to Android devices, it cannot perform any of these functions without being installed. This means a user would have to find the downloaded app, install it, turn off Android's standard protections against installing apps from unknown sources, and finally bypass Google's Verify Apps protections, which warn users when they are potentially installing malware. Buchka described the deception techniques, but said Google's Android security measures have started blocking the AdSense malware. "The malicious .apk was downloading without [a] user's actions. But the user had to give the permission on the installation. Fraudsters were using file names such as 'last-browser-update' [and] 'important-browser-update' to deceive the unsuspecting user and force him to install malicious .apk. The duped user allowed installation, thinking that it was a critical update," Buchka told SearchSecurity. "At the time of research, Google's Verify Apps protections [were] not detecting this application as potentially dangerous, but now Google's protection stops it."                                                                                        Next Steps Learn more about the results of Google's second Android Security Report.

Google’s Allo Lets Users Delete Messages from Chat History Allo is expected to be released pretty soon Aug 19, 2016 19:23 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Just a few days ago, Google released its video calling app Duo, which has already become the number 1 free app in the Play Store. However, during this year’s Google I/O, the company also announced a new messaging application, Allo. Allo is expected to be released soon, as information on the app continues to surface online, with the latest showing that the application will be coming with a feature that allows users to delete messages from their chat history. Users will be able to select the message and simply delete it from the chat. Android Police reports that the multiple select feature isn’t available just yet, but it could be provided later, considering that it has appeared in the beta testing phase of the app. It seems that the top bar of the app can switch to display share, forward, copy and delete options for a selected message. Sent and received messages can be deleted with ease. The messages are removed from the device and account, but they’re still left on the recipient’s phone. Another neat feature is that the application will offer to delete media contained in messages from the phone’s storage, not just the application. Messages sent through Allo can contain photos, videos, and even audio files. The new feature resembles the tools that WhatsApp offers, but the delete option isn’t found in Google’s Hangouts app. Google has also recently stated that Hangouts will start focusing on enterprise users.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (4 Images) #Google#Allo#Duo#Google I/O#Hangouts reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Allo comes with delete options (4 Images) 01 02 03 04 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Duo Becomes the Most Popular Free App in the Play Store Google to Add Audio Calls Support in Duo Google App V6.2 Beta Reveals Details About Google Assistant Google’s Allo and Duo Apps Get New Icons in the Play Store iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon 4 photos    Allo comes with the option to delete messages New Android APKs VivaVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:19 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:08 GMT WeVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:04 GMT Amazon Rapids APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:02 GMT ActionDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:58 GMT DataEye APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT JOOX APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT Reader comments Load old comments   Honor 8 Hands-On Impressions: Some High-End Specs Mixed with Premium Design more on: Honor 8 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Anti-Google research group in Washington is funded by Oracle At least 17 news articles have cited research by the "nonprofit watchdog group." by Joe Mullin - Aug 19, 2016 7:28 pm UTC Login to bookmark 85 The Google Transparency Project is a Washington, DC group that's laser-focused on letting Americans know about Google's lobbying efforts. To get its message out, GTP has worked with journalists at Re/Code and The Intercept, which have run stories about Google's many visits to the White House, the prevalence of ex-Googlers in the US Digital Service, and other links. What wasn't known, until today, is who was paying the bills for research by the "nonprofit watchdog" group. "The folks running the Google Transparency Project won’t say who is paying for it, which is odd for a group devoted to transparency," noted Fortune's Jeff John Roberts, one of many journalists who the group reached out to in April. Today, Roberts has published a followup, confirming that based on a tip, he found at least one funder—Oracle. That's the same company that lost a major copyright trial to Google and continues to spar with the search giant in court. “Oracle is absolutely a contributor (one of many) to the Transparency Project. This is important information for the public to know. It is 100 percent public records and accurate,” Oracle Senior VP Ken Glueck told Roberts. Other funders remain unknown. One big suspect, however, can be ruled out. Microsoft, whose lobbyists and lawyers have clashed with Google on many occasions, told Roberts that it is not part of the group. Is it a big deal? We're better off with the information being out there. Like Roberts, I agree that "throwing light on lobbying conducted by Google (or any other big company) is a good thing." However, it also seems like the source of the information should be made clear, especially for a group that's so focused on investigations against a particular company. GTP's research has led to a lot of news stories—many of them around the time of this year's Oracle v. Google trial—none of which reported that the Oracle is paying, at least in part, for the Google investigations. The Google Transparency Project is part of a larger organization called the Campaign for Accountability, an organization that says its goal is to use "research, litigation, and aggressive communications to expose how decisions made behind the doors of corporate boardrooms and government offices impact Americans' lives." It also works on issues like anti-LGBT discrimination and environmental protection. Expand full story Reader comments 85 You must login or create an account to comment.

M&F Editors  Advertisement The creatives at Google are always finding innovative ways to educate, inspire, and entertain via their Google Doodles. And today's "strong" showing is just another example, except they clearly didn't have anyone watching this dude's form. "That is a unique move: a hybrid stiff-leg deadlift-barbell row-reverse curl-push press," says M&F Deputy Editor Zack Zeigler. "Also, he has clearly skipped a few hundred leg days, but he gets a pass. Namely because he has bigger issues to contend with, like the fact that he is missing both feet. Maybe he should hold off on the upper-body moves until he A) puts on shorts (we can see your stem, sir), and B) adds muscle to those stilts he calls legs." Google ran the weightlifting Raspberry in an effort to promote the 11th day of the 2016 Doodle Fruit Games, where (hopefully organic!) produce from all over the market compete for the title freshest fruit, and players are flocking to get in on all the action. In today's main event we see the mighty, headband-wearing Raspberry warming up for the weightlifting competition. "That headband clearly needs an upgrade, but that unibrow is top-notch," adds Zack. "Also, this is for any guy, girl, or piece of produce who enters a gym: Flexing your face muscle pre- or post-lift is never advised in the fruit-lifting world." Yes, we know we're being tough on Raspberry, but we're not wrong: owning gigantic balloon-sized biceps and toothpick legs is a rotten look. However, by the time you finish reading this paragraph, the Raspberry will have knocked out 12 reps with no sign of slowing.

Students at Timrod Elementary School in Florence open a package containing the most recent piece of classroom furniture funded through DonorsChoose.org. Thirteen classroom stools have been added to the school’s computer lab. Melissa Rollins Morning News i By Melissa Rollins Florence Morning News LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story FLORENCE In modern classrooms, books and pencils are not the only things that teachers use to reach their students. However, with small budgets and limited resources anything outside of the essentials often comes out of a teacher’s pockets or doesn’t materialize at all. Websites like DonorChoose.org let teachers crowdfund their educational needs; strangers, other teachers and local community members can contribute as little or as much as they want. In Florence School District One, several teachers have had success getting their projects funded. With the start of a new school year, hundreds of active campaigns are just waiting to be supported. Timrod Elementary School Computer Lab teacher Toni Allen has had several campaigns funded through the website. She currently has two campaigns, one for Google Cardboard and one for headphones for the computer lab. “I found out about the website the year that I was teacher of the year -- that was 2013-2014,” Allen said. “I helped put together the district’s slideshow and found out that all of these teachers were getting grants through DonorsChoose and I had no idea what that was. After the district banquet, I went online to check it out. I did two and was funded within a week.” Most of the campaigns Allen has had completed were for Hokki Stools for her lab. “I have a lot of students that lean really far forward in their chairs or lean their chairs back and I was always telling them to put them down,” Allen said. “This way, they can move around and wiggle and I don’t have to tell them to stop.” Throughout the course of several campaigns, Allen has gotten 13 Hokki Stools. She currently has live campaigns for new headphones and one for Google Cardboard; the one for headphones has yet to get any funding. “It ends at the end of the month and I’m not sure it’s going to be funded,” Allen said. “Sometimes our headphones work and sometimes they don’t.” Google Cardboard use virtual reality to take people to places around the world. “I have seen Google Cardboard at several conferences and it is just awesome,” Allen said. “At one conference we did Antarctica and the rainforest. You can look and see what the ground looks like, what the sky looks like. We got to stand at the Grand Canyon and just see what was around. It seems like it would fit our kids really good because they can’t always go to those places.” Patty Ward, kindergarten teacher at Carver Elementary School, said she would encourage all teachers to use DonorsChoose. “The only way teachers can afford to get extra things for their classrooms is through DonorsChoose,” Ward said. “I’ve gotten stamps for a literacy center. I’ve gotten dominoes. I’ve gotten pattern blocks. I just got an easel from a project that was funded. I can’t afford all of this stuff myself; I wish there was a way that the district could provide a workshop on it. We are really blessed in Florence One because some districts don’t allow teachers to use it.” Ward said that getting started is easy. “You go in, put your name, your email address, what school you’re at, how many children you have and stuff like that,” Ward said. “It takes like five minutes to set up an account. You tell about what you are asking for and it would benefit your students. A lot of the donations are just a dollar; other times it is way more than a dollar. Every little bit helps.” Though it can be disappointing when a campaign doesn’t get funded, Ward said the key is to keep trying. “You don’t know until you try,” Ward said. “Teachers need to learn how to ask for help; people really do want to help. I highly recommend that teachers use DonorsChoose. Unfortunately, if their first one isn’t funded, a lot don’t ever do it again.” Some donations come completely from individuals, while other campaigns are chosen to have matching grants from foundations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In one case, Ward said, her request was filled in an unorthodox way. “One time I was asking for math manipulatives,” Ward said. “A teacher in New Jersey who had just retired saw my request and sent me a box full of them.” After contributing to a campaign, donors receive a thank-you note from the teacher and often the students that will be affected.

But hey, this is my blog, my game board, and I get to do what I want. My older sister and I have always been a bit competitive in playing games. Harriet and I go head to head with each other in Words with Friends, she often trouncing me, and sometimes, I her. I have this memory which she may dispute. That’s the thing with memory, we have out versions imprinted as truth, fact in our brains, but often it the story varies with whomever tells it. She was often more victorious than I in Monopoly, but one time I was getting all the breaks- the quick monopolies, hotels on Boardwalk/Park Place, getting the piles of cash from Free Parking, heck I bet I won the second prize in a beauty contest Chance card. I have a visual memory of her saying she was bored, yawning, hands stretching under the edge of the board, and just flipping the game board up in the air. I bet I cried and went to “tell” someone. Today Google owns a big game board on the internet where we put our effort, building, hoping for good draws of cards. But it’s totally their board. And who knows if it’s boredom, but they seem to get bored too, and just flip our little plastic buildings and fake deeds in the air. Need I mention Google Reader? Buzz. Answers. Orkut. Wave (well that was a good choice). Lot’s more. But it’s their board, they can do what they like. A year ago they decided to stop allowing web content to be hosted in Google Drive. Usual reasons. Other options are out there. They want to focus their energies elsewhere. This has an effect on those of us using Martin Hawksey’s genius script for an auto updated twitter archive. But in that case they gave a full year’s notice (Martin has a short term fix and is working on a long term one, someone knight that fella). Earlier this week (well that’ when I heard about it), the owner of the Googopoly game announced something that has a big impact for many of my projects (soon for the UDG Agora project), and others like Virtually Connecting, and many other educators who use Google Hangout. In one month (September 12) they were changing the way hangouts were run, moving them from Google+ (soon to be on that Wikipedia List of discontinued services, I bet) to YouTube. The reason was not clear. But the news was quickly pushed out from The Verge Google is killing off Hangouts on Air in September (totally misleading baited headline IMHO), ZDnet, 9to5 Google and probably another 100 “news stories” I could Google. The thing is– all of this rush to public stories are the same, they just re-wrote stuff that appears in the Google “announcement”. I must admit a bit of sky is falling reaction first, I usually try to avoid that. via GIPHY And I was in at least two Slack channels where people were WTF-ing, scrambling to find info. I am sure it was repeated elsewhere. They new interface for running Hangouts is within YouTube. That kind of makes sense. But they have co-mingled the “advanced” features that video pros like Andy Rush would use. If you are trying to figure things out and are in the area of downloading encoders (like I did), you are in the wrong place. There are stuff for video producers to do more with multiple sources, scenes, etc. People like Ken Bauer jumped in and did some tests and gave me some re-assurance that things were not as sky crashing as I might have thought. Mandy Honeyman shared this video, which explained a lot to me that I needed to know: So pretty much you can still schedule Hangouts, or just run them on one click, from the new YouTube Creators Studio under Live Streaming– or https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard. The thing to ignore is the links and the blue banner nudges to try the new improved “Stream Now” — those all lead to encoder land. If you end up having to choose encoders, go back. Use Events to do Hangouts as they were. I’ve got things set up (for now) in a way I understand. The one nut, as described in the video above, are the new hoops one has to jump through to have a live video stream embedding in another site. Until now, when you scheduled a Hangout, it provides you the Watch URL, the YouTube URL you send viewers, and that URL also becomes the link for the archive. This works well for our Virtually Connecting events, as we can announce them with a time converted, and in WordPress include the live stream / archive URL by just putting the URL on a blank line (see the most recent event). But now, sigh, to embed a live stream in your blog, you first have to click through screens to accept, and create settings for advertisements. The embed option is still not active. Then you have to go create an account and link your google account to Adsense. Even if you have no plans to run ads, apparently Google does. To activate adsense, you have to provide a mailing address, phone number etc. All of this to be able to embed a live stream. I started down the road to set this up for our UDG Agora project. I followed the idea we do in Virtually Connecting- I created a new Google account, and use the Chrome feature to log in as another user. Because our hangouts will have different hosts, by sharing access to this account, all of our Hangouts will land in the same YouTube Channel. In about 10 minutes of trying to set everything up to get the new embed settings cleared, I had 10 Google tabs open. I stopped. How necessary was the live stream option? So I did a test, I scheduled a hangout (one we are doing for reals) A scheduled hangout in the new YouTube interface There’s a clear button to run the hangout, and later today I will schedule in all 8-10 of our planned events. If you click “Edit”, the Watch Page button in the top right leads to the public URL (the one again where people where watch and where the archive will land). The one for this event is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRrRZrmoJvM. What I wondered was, while I expected the WordPress autoembed to fail (because I opted out of ads / adsenseless) I was curious if an archive would embed, because at that point, it is just a YouTube video. So I did a 40 second Hangout on Air of my dog sleeping on the deck (it is that exciting around here). So I have one YouTube URL of a scheduled Hangout and one of a past one, and I tested them on a WordPress page As expected, the scheduled link does not embed but a past one does. This says to me I can skip the adsense nonsense, and on event pages, just have a link to the URL before the event, and replace with the URL so it embeds after (I am betting I could write a WordPress plugin with a shortcode that would handle it automatically). Once in a hangout, everything is the same as it was. All the changes are in how you set them up. I learned two useful tricks in the process. If you go to the Live Streaming Dashboard, there is a “Change Thumbnail” buttons- this lets you choose a background image that will show up for live events before the go. I used a photo from a recent event: Don’t have a boring black background for your scheduled events, choose a thumbnail for your account But also, way way down in the bottom right corner, you see a URL box labeled “Share” with social media icons: Now this is super handy. This is one URL you can use to announce how to watch a live stream, no needing to dig out the URL. For Virtually Connecting, if we are running a live stream, it can always be watched at http://www.youtube.com/c/VirtuallyConnecting/live (when done, it is archived at its own URL). This makes announcing events easier, you can even tweet out from that dashboard. I don’t have all the answers, but I do not find them by reading those off the cuff posts on tech sites. Frankly, the way Google intertwines the new complicated stream features with the traditional hangouts is confusing. And that nonsense with needing to sign up for adsense looks like something designed by a committee of engineers. Google has, does, and will continue to flip the board on you. Why? Because they can. No, it’s because you should always keep in mind that despite messages of not doing evil or being committed to education, Google’s prime directive is to make money by selling advertisements. Everything is about serving ads based upon all the information they garner from you. And your image of “The Cloud” might be fluffy stuff of negligible weight, software services in that cloud need large physical infrastucture, rows of boxed servers, electricity, cooling, etc). The cloud has to be paid for. And it is paid for with advertisements, fine tuned by your personal dada. In many cases, I you, everyone else, sacrifices their information in the bargain of getting a service that looks free. But Google never sees you as an individual. They do not see that announcing a change of service in August might affect teachers who have made plans for courses starting now or in a few weeks. They do not see that as a small non profit organization you are too busy trying to do your work on thin budget then to spend time figuring out some new arcane interface. Google only sees you in an aggregate of massive data. You are an averaged sum to them. So it’s useless to speculate why they change/delete things. The answer is easy. If it does not make ad money for them, it will be tossed into the air. Your class, your project, your fan club, you– as an individual — do not matter to them. That’s how we play but really are played, by Googopoly. Top / Featured Image: A mashup of many random Monopoly game parts found on The Google (images search). Most were not openly licensed, and I freely admit taking them to remix into something new and commercially unviable. I am so guilty of theft. But at some point we have to ask about the idea of digital ownership of parts of popular culture used in a manner of open expression.

Was gonna pin them all but this does the trick Stephen Downes August 22, 2016 at 4:56 pm Reply So that’s 41 seconds of my life I’ll never get back. :p Good post, especially the bit telling me I can do a live video under ‘Events’ (who would think to look there?). Though that said after using the video encoder I find it’s a much better video. But Google is really sneaky the way it introduces it. Tom Smith August 25, 2016 at 2:17 am Reply @Stephen Downes – FYI, you don’t get any of it back. Not one minute. Not ever. Get used to it. :-) Hangouts used to be a quirky tool worth teaching people how to use, now I’m struggling myself, and know my colleagues just won’t get them. Yet again, Google have cocked it up royally. Sigh. Organisations are losing patience with Google because tools either wither on the vine of lack of progression and development or just get shafted.

Lots has changed, even its name (it's now called Alphabet). But one thing's for sure: Investors made tons of money on the stock. Shares of Alphabet (then called Google) has seen its shares rise 1,780% since first selling shares to the public in August 2004 at a split-adjusted $42 a share, says Bespoke Investment Group. That trounces the 99% gain by the Standard & Poor's 500 index during the same time period. During its time since its initial public offering, Alphabet has flooded the market with mobile devices running its Android operating system and maintained its near monopoly on Internet search. The company is now valued at $550 billion, making it the second most valuable company in the S&P 500 after Apple (AAPL) at $589 billion. But as remarkable as Google's rise has been, it isn't even the best place that investors could have put their money 12 years ago. It might be surprising, but energy drinks were even more lucrative for investors, as shares of Monster Beverage (MNST) have gained 11,630% since Google went public, Bespoke says. Google hasn't even been the best Internet stock, that distinction instead has gone to name-your-own price travel agent Priceline Group (PCLN), which has jumped 6,986% since Google went public. In fact, Google's stock gains were topped by five tech companies including Priceline such as Netflix (NFLX), Salesforce.com (CRM), Amazon.com (AMZN) and its archrival Apple (AAPL). That's not to belittle Alphabet's remarkable financial success resulting from collecting enormous amounts of data on its users and selling it to advertisers. Since 2004, Alphabet's revenue has soared 2,463.7% to $81.8 billion (as of the past 12 months) and net income has jumped even faster, 4,407%, to $18 billion. Analysts remain enthusiastic about the stock's future. Analysts on average are calling for the stock to be worth $935 a share in 18 months, which would be 17% higher than the Friday's closing price of $799.65.

We rank all 16 Angry Birds games 8 things you need to know about Duo, Google's new video chat app Video Google Daydream View unboxing: A first look at Google's VR headset Been waiting on Google to make a simple, easy-to-use FaceTime competitor? Luckily, Duo is finally here, and the super-streamlined app enables hassle-free video chat between both Android and iOS devices. Duo is this week’s most notable new app release, but it’s not the only one that should be on your radar. Deus Ex Go is the latest console and PC franchise to get the Go treatment after Hitman and Lara Croft, and it’s a slick and smart tactical adaptation. Meanwhile, Mr. Robot arrives on Android with a compelling text adventure, FordVR lets you experience the 24 Hours of Le Mans race via Cardboard, and the entertaining Not Golf is like golf… but not. Snag a few fresh apps for your phone and enjoy the weekend! Google Duo The Knock Knock preview gives you an early glimpse at what’s on the other end of a call. Announced back at I/O alongside messaging app Allo, Google Duo is finally here to bring a FaceTime-like level of simplicity to video chat across both Android and iOS alike. Duo has a dead-simple interface and is tied to your phone number, and you can easily ping a contact for a video call with a tap or two. Also, new feature Knock Knock lets you preview the video feed on the other end, so you can prepare yourself for good or bad news (or dodge the call, as needed). Duo calls are end-to-end encrypted, in case you’re worried about privacy, and Google says its calls work well even on meager data connections. Hangouts hasn’t been a reliably great option for video calls, while Snapchat and Skype can seem comparably complex or overstuffed compared to something like this. Duo’s simplicity and straightforward design could make a standout option in this crowded market, especially thanks to its cross-platform approach.  Deus Ex Go Deus Ex Go scales down the stealth-action experience without losing the glossy sheen. Following in the footsteps of Hitman Go and Lara Croft Go comes Deus Ex Go ($5), another smart adaptation of a beloved console and PC game series. Based on the cyberpunk stealth shooter games, Deus Ex Go translates the premise into a turn-based puzzler, wherein you’ll move robotically-enhanced hero Adam Jensen around game boards to reach the exit. Naturally, the paths are lined with enemies and obstacles, and you’ll need to figure out the best timing and tactics to get through safely.  Keeping with the source material, Deus Ex Go adds a new hacking component to levels that lets you manipulate turrets and walkways, plus it’s the first Go game to actually have a storyline included. Luckily, you don’t need to be a die-hard Deus Ex fan to enjoy this brainy game, and beyond the 50 core levels, it’ll offer a new stage every weekday for some time to come. Mr. Robot:1.51exfiltrati0n.apk You can be a total troll with response options like these. Are you engrossed in USA Network’s hit hacker drama Mr. Robot? Well, now there’s a game that lets you live out some of the shenanigans on the show. Mr. Robot:1.51exfiltrati0n.apk ($3)—and yes, that’s really its Play Store title—is a narrative adventure that takes the form of a chat app from the show’s antagonistic E Corp company. It acts a bit like text-based game Lifeline, in that the story unfolds in little moments throughout your day. The game takes place during the first season of the show, and you play the unlucky soul who happened to find the dropped phone of series character Darlene. She needs the device and its contents to carry out fsociety’s massive hack, so you’ll navigate conversations and choose responses to help shape the storyline ahead. From what I’ve played so far, it seems like a really neat way to go further down the rabbit hole of the show’s ever-twisting narrative. FordVR You won’t be in the driver’s seat, but at least you can be next to it. If you have a Cardboard viewer, you ought to give a look to FordVR, the official virtual reality app from the automaker’s racing division. It launched this week with “The Return to Le Mans,” a 360-degree mini-documentary that chronicles the company’s epic battle against Ferrari to win the grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans race (LM GTE category) in France. You’ll experience the day from various perspectives: alongside the track, in the passenger seat of the Ford GT, and even on a Ferris wheel that overlooks the course as nighttime sets in. And of course, you can look freely around each view with the headset against your face, plus the app has a non-Cardboard option to watch in full-screen on the phone. A “World Rallycross with Ken Block” experience will be added next month. Not Golf It’s not exactly golf, but it is pretty fun. Following in the footsteps of side-scrolling games like Super Stickman Golf and Desert Golfing, Not Golf is an amusing little indie game that challenges you to fling a ball around the course—only you’re not aiming for a hole, but rather a direct hit against the gold placard. While the first course is relatively straightforward, before long you’ll find levels with the destination below the starting point, or where the ball is already moving when the stage begins.  Swiping and releasing your finger whips the ball in that direction, and you can course-correct in mid-air by swiping again, but each counts as a stroke: and just like in real golf, the goal here is to have a low-scoring game. Not Golf is super minimal in design, but if you dug Super Stickman Golf or especially its delightful spinoff Flappy Golf, then you’ll probably get a kick out of it.

If a few things had gone differently, Spain very well could have pulled off the upset. Whichever team faces them in the gold medal game (spoiler alert: it almost certainly will be Australia) won’t just be happy to be there, they will know that they really do have a chance to beat this team. Which is a good thing for the sport overall, I think. This year’s US men’s team has been more intriguing than previous editions because they’re clearly more vulnerable. It should be a great gold medal game.

Officials are getting their last chances at using their whistles.

Jorge P (rightfully) calls me out on my parochialism: “But it has been a close affair at the half, which is usually the only hope you can have heading into an Olympic basketball game featuring the US squad.” Come on... The last three USA Vs. Spain have been close affairs nearly the whole way through. I’d even argue that 2008 would have been closer if FIBA rules had applied to USA as they did to the rest of the teams... and don’t even get me talking about the officiating in the 2004 game. Anyway, this is an older and not wiser Spain (except Rudy, who couldn’t get dumber I guess). So yeh, USA are about to run away with it.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.37pm EDT 15:37 Spain 39-48 USA, 8:47, 3rd quarter Apparently the officials and the coaches had a little conference during halftime, hopefully there’ll be less officiating madness this half. And as soon as I type that, they call a foul on Gasol to put DeAndre Joran to the line. Jordan makes one of two. Email from Daniel Cavanillas It is hard to explain how much this Spanish team means to those of us who were born in Spain during the 80s or 90s. A whole generation has grown up watching Gasol, Navarro et al dominating the international scene and beating everyone but the USA. To see this bunch of players beat the Americans on their last tournament together would be a dream come true. Having said that, how do you rate Spain’s chances after the first half? I’m following the match from a bus heading to Stansted, so I don’t know what you make it it so far. I personally think that the US is going to pull ahead here in the second half, relatively soon but Spain have to be happy about the spot they’re in. They could very well pull this off.

This has been just a massively ugly game and a lot of it is on how the game is being called.

This one’s on Cousins, who only has two somehow (okay mostly because he’s played very little, but still, this is an improvement compared to his normal rate.) Felipe Reyes to the line, he makes both free throws. And then Gasol gets called on a foul. This one puts Kyrie on the line, he makes both. This quarter is never going to end.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Worried about Google’s Your Timeline? Here’s how to disable tracking 24 Jul 2015 6 Android, Google, iOS, Mobile, Privacy Post navigation Previous: Artificial Intelligence expert likens AI dangers to nuclear weapons Next: SSCC 208 – (Cyber)crime and Punishment [PODCAST] by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit There’s a shark tracker put out by the conservationists at OCEARCH that ties together the data emitted by tagged sharks, displaying the wanderings of the apex predators to fans. Now, thanks to Google, you too can consider yourself tagged. Google on Tuesday announced something called Your Timeline: a Google Maps tool that promises to enable users to “rediscover” the places we’ve been on any given day, the routes we’ve taken to get there, and the photos we took and which Google tucked away into Google Photos. This is all data that Google keeps track of on our behalf, all adding up to a rather terrifying portrait of how much the apex data predator snarfs down about us. “Only you can see your timeline,” Google says. From its post: Your Timeline is private and visible only to you; and you control the locations you choose to keep.  Thank God for that, given what Your Timeline reveals about: Your movements; What’s easily discernible as your home, down to the street address; The places you frequently go, which points to where your family, friends, illicit dalliances or political collaborators are located; The routes you take to get there; The businesses that you visited on any given day (as well as Google’s guess as to where you went, if you haven’t already confirmed its guesses); and Photos that document who you were with on a particular day at a specific place. Can we trust Google to keep such information safe and private? It would be nice to think so, but why even take that chance? Just ask the Ashley Madison cheaters whose private information has been breached how trusting we should be of sites that amass our data. My guess is that the short, expletive-free version would be “Not very.” How to erase your footprints Google says it’s easy to delete a day or your full history at any time. Users can also edit places that appear, including removing a specific location or giving a frequented spot a private name. Your Timeline is easy to disable: just go to your timeline page, and in the Settings menu (it’s the one with a cog icon) select “Pause Location History.” That will stop Google Maps from collecting places you go with your devices and adding them to your Location History map. You can also delete all the already-stored places from the Settings menu too – just select “Delete all Location History”. Google warns that doing either of these will limit functionality of some Google products over time, such as Google Maps and Google Now, so it’s up to you to decide if it’s appropriate for you. Note that pausing Location History doesn’t turn off Location Reporting or location services for a given device. If you want to completely turn off GPS or Wi-Fi location services, you can turn off your device’s main location feature with these steps, from a contributor to Google’s support forums. She notes that some of the information applies only to devices running Android 5.0 and higher. Note that disabling all location-finding features will throw a monkey wrench into the functioning of some popular apps, so it’s wise to carefully consider which you want to strip of location services. Here’s a cheat sheet on how to do it: On Android Open App drawer. Select Settings, then Location. Find Google Location Settings and individually switch off both Location Reporting and Location History. Underneath Location History, select “Delete Location History” to wipe clean the cache of locations. Repeat the steps for every Google account you have registered. On iOS Open Settings. Select Privacy, then Location Services. Either disable all Location Services using the slider at the top, or scroll through the list to decide, case-by-case, which apps you want to allow. At the bottom, select “System Services” and decide what features you want to allow. Also note that using Google Search and Maps will still cause some location data to be saved as part of your private Web & App Activity.

Here’s how to disable tracking” Anonymous says: July 24, 2015 at 7:30 pm Some day I will get arrested for doing 130 mph on the highway (when there are no other cars), it will be my phone that is used to clock me and used as evidence against me, since it will try and take a picture to prove I was driving while the GPS tracked the speed. My buddy uses google on his phone to track how fast he rides his bike and where he’s been… So it’s a matter of time. Guess I should put my phone in a shielded bag while driving ;) Reply 4caster says: July 25, 2015 at 5:15 am Anonymous can relax. For a speed measurement to be used to convict you, it has to be corroborated by an independent measurement or witness, even if only the word of a police officer who observed you going like a bat out of hell. But I don’t recommend driving at 130 mph on the public highway, even when you can see no other cars. Reply David Bear Holland says: July 27, 2015 at 2:17 pm Take you phone with you whilst ‘Sky-Diving’! Such fun, the phone would register your speed (at approx. 180mph and hardly change position!!! (NOT!)…. Reply confused says: July 26, 2015 at 4:19 am I just purchased my first android phone and I looked in the apps for anything with the word location in it. There are 4 which are Android specific settings and then there are Google Maps, Street View, and google play Store which I had already disabled but the Android apps e.g. Location Services I have no idea what to do with? Reply ejhonda says: July 27, 2015 at 3:51 pm Google is hardly accurate at tracking your location. When checking a trip I took from from NY to Atlanta, GA one time, it showed I took a quick side trip to Michigan from Atlanta, but returned to Atlanta after an hour. A more recent trip I took from NY to CT showed I took a quick side jaunt to Rhode Island. Neither of those side trips took place, and from the time lines associated with the side trips, it was quite obvious they were physically impossible unless I’m somehow unintentionally stepping into a time machine. Reply Rosa says: August 19, 2016 at 3:50 pm Same here… Google adds side trips for me that never occurred. It’s a pain in the butt when I try to look back, or search for a specific place for a reason, and I find it was replaced with some other information. Because then I’m at a loss for the details I went back to look for, PLUS I’m then stuck with the time-consuming problem of having to “fix things” (which btw often becomes tedious) to top it off. And if I’m on a time frame for those missing details we are now taking “frustration’ 😑 Bottom line, if I have to do detective work to figure out where I’ve been, how I got there, and exact arrival/departure information to fit the pieces of the puzzle correctly, well then… that pretty much defeats the purpose!!!

(Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images) Viewers tuning into the Olympics and watching BMX cycling probably have a few thoughts. A) Wait, BMX is an Olympic sport? (Yes, it became an Olympic medal sport at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.) B) Why are the bikes so small? The latter question, in fact, is the top searched question about the sport, according to Google Trends. BMX bikes are small wonders. "Why are #BMX bikes so small?" is the top searched question about the sport. #Olympics pic.twitter.com/vf5SAASAoB — Google (@google) August 19, 2016 As Google explains, the smaller the bike, the bigger the jump. The bikes usually have 20-inch rim wheels and only have one gear. They’re designed to have a resistant frame to support the riders’ jumps throughout the course. Olympic BMX cycling is a sport that mixes racing and jumps and so riders need a lightweight bike to go fast and that can withstand the impact of landing repeatedly after jumps. At the Olympics, riders race around in a circuit of 300-meters to 400-meters with several jumps, rises and descents. The first four to cross the finish line advances to the following round. The national governing body of the sport in the United States, the American Bicycle Association, states on its website that the bikes are built small, “so you can go BIG.” Bikes promoted by the association have “20-inch wheels designed to accelerate in a hurry and handle the biggest landings,” according to the association’s website. There are a variety of BMX bikes for different purposes, but in general, “BMX is a sport built on the premise of racing fast, off-road tracks on a bicycle smaller and lighter than a road bike or mountain bike,” the adventure sports website Mpora stated in an articled published earlier this year. The BMX finals took place Friday afternoon, with American Connor Fields winning Team USA’s first gold in the event. Alise Post won silver in the women’s event, the best BMX finish for an American woman at the Olympics.

SEO is dead This is perhaps the most popular SEO-related myth and it ended up an urban legend, widely spread among sites and communities. If you believe that SEO is indeed dead, or if you’re just a pessimist, I assume the rest of the myths won’t be much useful to you. SEO changes and evolves, but as long as there are ways to help your site rank higher in the SERPs, SEO will still be here.  2. SEO is all about adding the right keywords There used to be a time when keyword density was (mistakenly) synonymous with a good SEO practice, but as search engines keep changing, so does our SEO strategy. Keywords are still important for optimisation, but the focus is more on the content and its relevance, rather than the exact keyword. The arrival of RankBrain made even clearer the focus on relevance, with the page being crawled for its content and emphasising the user experience, rather than the use of the exact keyword. No more awkward headlines to favour a specific keyword, let’s concentrate on the content’s meaning. 3. SEO is about a number one ranking Many “SEO ninjas” promise to land your business at the top spot for just $100, but even if they manage to deliver their promises, it isn’t just about the ranking.  Your SEO strategy should aim to increase traffic, engagement and eventually conversions and this cannot be achieved by merely focusing on the site’s position in SERPs.  It’s true that being on the first page of SERPs can lead to an increase of traffic to your page, but the goal is not to simply gain the top spot. For example, featured snippets, the summary of an answer to a user’s query that is displayed on top of Google search results, can lead to an increase of traffic of up to 20-30%, but 70% of them do not come from the first organic result. Thus, it’s the optimisation of the content, the usefulness and the relevance that may lead to additional traffic and make your SERP position more effective. 4. The more webpages you have, the better the ranking Quantity should not be preferred over quality. You can create as many webpages as you want if you feel that they add value to your site, but there’s no need to create additional pages hoping to increase your crawling from search engines. Not every page is indexed and quality is a crucial factor for your attempt to increase your site’s visibility, so keep that in mind next time you feel inclined to create new (pointless) pages. 5. Image optimisation is not necessary Image optimisation is important and although it’s a relatively easy process, we sometimes need to remind ourselves to do it when creating new content. As search engines cannot actually see your images, you need to provide the right description to make them ‘visible’. Google suggests you use descriptive titles and captions, while the use of a keyword can also be useful. Make sure you fill in the fields of title, alt text and description, as they all contribute to the increased chances of having your image visible in search engines. Also, keep in mind that a unique image has more chances to be seen, compared to a boring stock photo. 6. Mobile optimisation is overrated Do you still underestimate mobile optimisation in 2016?  Google’s push for mobile optimisation, most notably with the ‘mobile-friendly’ updates should tell you otherwise.  In Google’s own words: On average, people check their phones more than 150 times a day,  and more searches occur on mobile phones than computers. But if a potential customer is on a phone, and a site isn’t easy to use, they’re five times more likely to leave. To avoid losing out in these crucial moments, you need a site that loads quickly and is easy to use on mobile screens. The first step is seeing how your site is performing. We can help by scoring your site for mobile-friendliness, mobile speed, and desktop speed. Mobile optimisation is all about the user experience, whether it’s the design of the page, the responsiveness, the number of clicks, the page speed, or even the screen size. What’s more, we cannot underestimate Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), Google’s latest attempt to improve the performance of mobile web articles in a light, fast version of a page. As it now arrives in organic search results, it’s becoming quite imperative to give it a try and enhance the user experience and hence, the traffic to your post. We have extensively covered mobile optimisation, but here are three posts I’m encouraging you to read if you want to learn more about the topic: Why and how to comprehensively test the mobile usability of your site When will responsive websites respond to user context? Google’s next mobile-friendly update will include page speed 7. SEO is not working for me If you feel that SEO is not working for perhaps you need to know more about SEO, or maybe you haven’t hired the right person for this task. SEO isn’t a quick fix to bring your site to the top of the SERPs, it’s a continuous process which needs to be re-evaluated and monitored to ensure its efficacy. As websites and search engines change, so do their optimisation for improved visibility, so if you feel that SEO hasn’t worked for you in the past, then maybe it’s time to start all over again with one step at a time, until you understand enough the process to examine your progress on your site and its “crawlability”. 8. Link building is dead Link building has been proclaimed dead many times, but it’s still around, keeping up with the changes of our times. Link building is about creating links with the ultimate goal to increase a site’s presence (and traffic). It may not be efficient anymore to be part of a private blog network or use spammy anchor text, but the fundamental goal of link building is still present, provided that we know how to use it. A link building strategy may be time consuming, but it may also be rewarding and let’s not forget the fact that links are still important ranking factors. According to “The State of Link Building Survey”, the most effective method of link building in 2016 is based in content, whether it’s promotion, or guest posting. What’s promising is the fact that the state of link building is still strong in 2016, as good links will always matter. 9. Social media does not affect SEO It’s easy to assume that social media has nothing to do with SEO, as your social traffic is not a ranking factor for SERPs, but this doesn’t mean that it still cannot influence your online presence. As social media usage keeps increasing, your authority is gradually building among many different platforms and this may help search engines with discovery and indexation. Moreover, content distribution has moved towards social media quite aggressively, which means that social sharing may contribute to effective link building and of course, increased traffic to your site. Social media marketing can help you increase your site’s visibility which is also appreciated by search engines. Think of how Google+ can be “spotted” by Google, or how the indexed tweets can increase the brand awareness, and eventually your credibility. Although there is no guarantee that a successful social presence can boost your SEO, but there is an indication that it can help it. And here are more examples on how social media can actually benefit your SEO efforts. 10. Local SEO is not for everyone Local SEO is becoming more important year-by-year, but not everyone understands yet how it can be useful even in the least expected case. You don’t have to own a local business (or even have a physical presence) to benefit from local SEO and here are some of our suggestions on how to take advantage of content gaps and structured data. What’s more, if you feel that your business is still struggling to benefit from local SEO, then maybe it’s time to start with a few basic steps, in order to help its local visibility. First of all, is your business listed on Google Business? Do you pay enough attention on your reviews? (Yes, reviews affect your local search ranking) How is your customer service? Do you provide the right information on your online presence? Are you focusing on mobile customers? (94% of mobile searches are have a local intent) According to our own editor, Christopher Ratcliff: “Accurate and complete Google My Business information + accurate location data + positive customer reviews + traditional SEO tactics = good local ranking (possibly).” 11. Don’t worry about SEO just create good content I came across a tweet mentioning that quality content can beat any SEO optimisation, and that’s how this myth came up. It’s true that the quality of your content is important, but if you don’t optimise it (or promote it), how will you reach a wider audience? People have tried to dismiss technical SEO, but it’s what underpins an effective search strategy. As we’re crafting our SEO efforts for 2017 (yes, it’s closer than you think), it’s time to leave all these SEO myths behind. Haven’t we already heard enough of “SEO is dead”?

SUBSCRIBE The future of the map The leap from physical to digital maps was game-changing for marketers and consumers alike, but what's next on the horizon? Columnist Brian Smith explores some possibilities for the future of mapping. Brian Smith on August 19, 2016 at 10:06 am More We’ve come a long way since the days of unfolding a paper map across a dashboard just to plot the next move on our road trips. Though it’s unlikely maps will soon make another leap so dramatic as going from inhabiting our glove compartments to inhabiting our cell phones, digital maps continue to evolve at an astonishing pace. Here’s a look at the direction future maps are heading — and its implications for local marketing. Going beyond and below the pin Today, the digital map is dominated by the pin. That’s not likely to change. Pins simply make it easy to find locations on a map — too easy to ever fall out of use. However, that doesn’t mean the area around the pin will remain static. In fact, we’re seeing the buildings the pins represent undergoing a radical transformation in their clickability. If you open Google Maps and zoom in on your current location, you’ll notice that the walls of the buildings around you have become much more distinct and “3-D” — so much so that they cast tiny digital shadows. The buildings themselves have become so visually enticing recently it’s almost as if Google wants you to click on them… which of course is precisely what Google wants you to do. As of right now, only the largest, the most iconic and the most frequently visited buildings are getting this clickable treatment. For example, take a look at Rio’s Olympic soccer stadium, the Maracanã. By zooming in and clicking on it, Google literally blows the roof right off the building by allowing you to toggle through its various floors, making it easy to find things like bathrooms and stairs. Places like shopping malls and sporting venues are the current primary beneficiaries of indoor mapping. While the mapping feature is underutilized at the moment, don’t expect it to stay that way for long. As businesses and consumers become more familiar with the feature, buildings you’re less likely to get lost in will begin implementing indoor mapping as well. The likely early adopters will be big-box retailers, especially if their businesses inhabit multiple floors with multiple departments (or even multiple businesses) under the same roof. But other industries are ripe for mapping the great indoors as well. Hospitals, with their labyrinth of various medical offices, are likely early adopters. So, too, are sprawling universities and hotels. Your business location can be an early adopter, too, if you feel so inclined. All you have to do is submit your indoor location information to Google here. But let’s say you’re a small business that isn’t located in a shopping mall; why should you care about implementing indoor mapping? Because inventory mapping is the future of local marketing.  Inventory mapping These days, customers do so much pre-shopping online that they’ve often picked out their product long before they set foot in a store. This is especially true for millennials, who would prefer to skip chitchatting with the sales associate and simply pick up the item they came for at the discounted price of the coupon they dug up online. There’s an obvious need for inventory mapping — just ask anyone who has ever tried to find a tool at Home Depot on their own. It’s no coincidence that Home Depot employs some of the best sales associates in the business; we’d literally be lost without them! Granted, Home Depot does have a map with inventory placement on their app, but that only does you good if you happen to have downloaded the app. Therefore, the logical next step in the evolution of mapping technology is inventory finding and tracking. Eventually, we’ll reach the point where inventory is integrated with the map, and a click on a product ad will not only lead you to the store with that product in stock, but also to the very shelf it sits on. Many companies, Target in particular, are making excellent strides in terms of product mapping for customers. But making the connection between local searches and the product on the shelf has yet to be realized. Most likely the breakthrough will come in the form of RFID or some other real-time location system. While beacons are frequently touted for their ability to push (or hassle) customers with notifications, they are proximity-based, and so they don’t track individual items. RFID technology, on the other hand, has the advantage of being incorporated directly into the product. Not only does RFID allow the tracking of individual items on the shelf, but it also allows the tracking of individual customers as they push their carts down the aisles — assuming they have products in their carts. Self-driving cars, drones and the need for real-time mapping Another aspect of mapping that’s going to continue to develop at breakneck speed is real-time mapping. The big push behind this need is self-driving cars and automated drones, both on the ground and in the air. Interestingly enough, self-driving cars, with their abundance of cameras and sensors feeding road conditions back to the fleet in real time, are likely to provide a major part of the solution. As the speed at which maps are updated continues to improve, this opens up exciting opportunities for temporary locations. Granted, temporary locations do sometimes appear on Google Maps — for example, a search for the beach volleyball venue at the Rio Olympics will appear on the map even though the stadium won’t last much longer than the summer games. However, for the vast majority of us, it isn’t likely we’ll be hosting the Olympic games in our neighborhood anytime soon. But that’s precisely where the greatest potential for temporary events lies. Think local farmer’s markets, music festivals, bike races and the like. Facebook does an excellent job at letting you know what temporary events are happening near you, but temporary events and locations have yet to be implemented on the major mapping providers. I’d expect that to soon begin to change. Mapping the virtual and physical world Another thing to keep an eye on with the future of maps and local marketing is the overlapping of the physical world with the virtual. As I mentioned in my Pokémon Go article, augmented reality opens up the potential for virtual billboards that will significantly rely on mapping technology for their placement. From a legal standpoint, very little has been done to define the digital property rights that overlap the physical world. But my guess is that that the physical ownership of property will eventually equate to the virtual ownership of the same space. If this happens, you can be certain that digital mapping precision will take on an even greater importance. Google Maps becomes an increasingly walled garden Ads have officially arrived on Google Maps. As such, Google would prefer that you not leave the map — unless of course, you click on an ad. In an effort to keep you in Google Maps longer, and therefore increase the likelihood of your clicking on an ad, expect Google Maps to become an increasingly walled garden. The only way Google accomplishes this is by improving the utility of Maps through things like indoor mapping and by returning increasingly personalized local search results directly to the map. Furthermore, you can be certain that as the utility of digital maps improves, so will the importance of local search. Mapping the great indoors is the next frontier. But it’s only the beginning. It’s time brands take a long look at the map and start plotting a course for the future ahead.

SUBSCRIBE Google says bots are the main target of Keyword Planner changes; a lot of questions remain Advertisers and agencies continue to have questions about how potential data restrictions will affect their research efforts. Ginny Marvin on August 19, 2016 at 9:40 am More When Google announced last week it was limiting access to Keyword Planner data, it raised more questions than it answered. Will new advertisers be able to get detailed Keyword Planner data before setting up and launching campaigns? As a refresher, the notice from last week (bolding added): Advertisers with lower monthly spend may see a limited data view in the Keyword Planner. For example, you may see values such as 0, 1-100, 100-1K, 1K-10K, 10K-100K, 100K-1M, 1M+ in the average monthly searches column. In addition, other advertisers may trigger the limited data view by reaching a limit on the number of searches for search volume data (specifically, requests to our API). What does “lower monthly spend” even mean — $100 per month, $1,000 per month? That’s just a start. The explanation given, “These changes will ensure that AdWords advertisers are able to get the data they need to optimize their accounts,” seemed to belie the action taken by penalizing smaller advertisers. The move was clearly aimed at non-advertisers using the tool for research (SEOs and others) and third parties querying on a heavy basis via the API. But following the vague criteria given, the explanation didn’t square with many advertisers, either. On Thursday, CassieH, the Google representative who has been communicating these changes on the AdWords Community forum, added more detail (bolding added): This change was made so that we can consistently give advertisers the data they need to optimize their accounts, while preventing ‘bots’ and other services from abusing the intended use of Keyword Planner. The search volume estimates, though displayed differently in some cases, still provide an accurate and helpful view of how many clicks and impressions keywords may receive. This latest explanation puts the emphasis on the high-frequency abuse, not the individual researchers using the Planner. If frequent pings by bots are the main problem, is this really the only way to handle them? Why cut off access to all non-paying accounts — many of which are held by high-paying agencies — if high-frequency abuse is the real reason for the change? And there’s an argument to be made that the broad ranges of search volumes given when detail is not available do not “provide an accurate and helpful view” of potential volume. It’s understandable why Google won’t provide explicit thresholds on query frequency — those executing the bots could potentially adjust to come under the maximum limit. But it still doesn’t explain the pay-to-use policy coupled with frequency limits unless it is also aimed at SEOs and other researchers using the tool for free. To add to the confusion, Google’s execution of this change came amid technical glitches and a switch to reporting the same search volumes for close variants. When users started seeing warnings that they’d need an active account to use Keyword Planner earlier this summer, Google assured Search Engine Land in June that this was not the case. Turns out it is. Among the concerns advertisers have expressed on the AdWords Community Forum following the news last week: Paul R: “[M]any people inside an agency may use the KW planner tool for research but do not use the account in which they manage clients’ account[s].” Bill H: “The basis of my worry is how a move like this could create an even more tilted playing field, favoring large companies over SMBs or startups.” Steph W: “How are we able to figure out new budgets if the account hasn’t even started yet?” CassieH has reiterated that “most advertisers running paid campaigns will not be affected by this change.” I have still been able to access full Keyword Planner data in accounts that have never had or don’t currently have active campaigns. I assume that access to detailed data will end after a certain number of queries in the Planner, but it makes me wonder if new advertisers, at least, will have running room to do initial research before launching. Google has not responded to a request for comment on this. The restriction, of course, is another blow to SEOs, who started losing access to organic query data starting in 2011, culminating in 2013 with 100 percent “not provided.” The reality is that Google’s keyword research tools were designed to help advertisers develop their search campaigns. The availability of the External Keyword Tool for years, however, set expectations that it should be open and available to all. A few milestones in the evolution of Google’s keyword tools: In 2005, Google launched the AdWords Keyword Suggestion Tool, which required account login. The older, less sophisticated Google AdWords Keyword Sandbox eventually became the External Keyword Tool that anyone could access. In 2010, Google rolled out a big update to the Keyword Tool. At SMX East that year, a Google representative clarified that the keyword tool was only providing data on “commercial” keywords, i.e., queries that would trigger ads. In 2013, Google sunsetted the Keyword Tool and launched Keyword Planner, which combined Traffic Estimator and Keyword Tool. With that change, Keyword Planner became accessible only through AdWords, eliminating the External Keyword Tool. As a workaround, non-advertisers simply signed up for an AdWords account and didn’t activate any campaigns. With this latest change, bots and services using the API appear to be the primary targets. The question remains how the change will affect advertisers and agencies who use the Planner in no- and low-spend accounts and those with MCCs that do heavy research.

According to a Bloomberg estimate, the deal could be valued at about $680 million. Uber, whose "anyone-can-be-a-cabbie" business model has already shaken up the taxi industry, is also looking to provide autonomous car services in cities. Later this month, the company plans to begin testing self-driving cars on the streets of Pittsburgh, although a human -- an Uber engineer rather than a regular self-employed driver -- will remain at the wheel to take over if there's trouble. These recent moves signal Uber's desire to take human drivers out of its business equation entirely. The timing is noteworthy as just yesterday, a U.S. District Court judge in California rejected the company's proposal to settle a class-action lawsuit by current and former Uber drivers who claimed they should be classified as employees rather than independent contractors. Otto Plus Uber = 'Dream Team' Co-founded by several veterans of Google, including Anthony Levandowski, who was formerly an engineer with Google's Self-Driving Car Project, Otto just launched in May. The company, which has been testing sensor-equipped autonomous trucks (pictured above), said its mission is to improve highway safety and trucking efficiency. "Together with Uber, we will create the future of commercial transportation: first, self-driving trucks that provide drivers unprecedented levels of safety; and second, a platform that matches truck drivers with the right load wherever they are," the company noted yesterday in a blog post. When it comes to this advanced technology stack, Otto plus Uber is a "dream team," Uber co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in a post on his company's blog yesterday. "Anthony is one of the world's leading autonomous engineers: his first invention, a self-driving motorcycle called Ghostrider, is now in the Smithsonian," Kalanick said. "Just as important, Anthony is a prolific entrepreneur with a real sense of urgency." Like Otto, Uber promotes its technology as a way to improve efficiency and safety on the road. Kalanick cited statistics showing that some 90 percent of the 1 million people killed in collisions every year are caused by human error. "This is a tragedy that self-driving technology can help solve," he said. 'Outrageous PR Stunt' In a separate development, Bloomberg Businessweek reported yesterday that through a partnership with Volvo, Uber will begin deploying specially equipped Volvo XC90 sports utility vehicles to test self-driving technology with real-life Uber customers in Pittsburgh. Passengers requesting rides will randomly get self-driving cars instead of regular Uber vehicles, although two Uber employees will be in front to monitor the cars' performances and take over if issues arise. John Simpson, Privacy Project director at the advocacy organization Consumer Watchdog, which has urged caution and strict regulation for self-driving vehicle technology, called Uber's Pittsburgh tests an "outrageous PR stunt." "There has been no adequate demonstration that Uber's robot cars are safe," Simpson told us today. "It is unconscionable for them to offer rides to passengers at this stage." Uber's move into autonomous trucks with its purchase of Otto shows it is "doubling down on its bet on robot technology, but we're simply not there yet," he added. One trucking concept, called "platooning," would involve using a lead truck to control a series of other big rigs behind it, but a human driver would still be needed to monitor those vehicles, Simpson said. "Self-driving trucks, because of their size and weight, raise serious safety issues if there is an attempt to operate them intermingled with car traffic," he said.

The world's fifth largest automaker hopes to enter into a symbiotic relationship, where it will bring its manufacturing prowess to Google and the Silicon Valley giant will help the automaker's autonomous technology development. "Hyundai is lagging behind the competition to develop autonomous vehicles," Ko Tae Bong, senior auto analyst at Hi Investment & Securities Co, told Bloomberg News. "It's not a choice but a critical prerequisite for Hyundai to cooperate with IT companies, such as Google, to survive in the near future." Google Google's self-driving Lexus pilot project. At a news conference with Korea's Minister of Trade on Wednesday, Haeng said that "because Google is not too familiar with vehicles" his company can help with the execution of Google's self-driving vehicle, which is one of the most advanced in the market. The two companies are already connected in that Google's self-driving vehicle project is being led by John Krafcik, the former CEO of Hyundai Motor America; Krafcik left Hyundai in 2013. Hyundai also has been among the most aggressive automakers adopting Alphabet's Android Auto and Apple's CarPlay, which allow the iPhone and Android smartphones to connect wirelessly to car infotainment systems. Hyundai Hyundai has been the most aggressive carmaker in deploying Google's Android Auto smartphone interface. This is not the first time Google has sought expertise from an automaker. In May, Google announced it was buying 100 plug-in hybrid minivans from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) to expand its autonomous technology. "This collaboration with [FCA] is the first time we've worked directly with an automaker to create our vehicles," Google said in a blog at the time. "FCA will design the minivans so it's easy for us to install our self-driving systems, including the computers that hold our self-driving software, and the sensors that enable our software to see what's on the road around the vehicle." Google's self-driving vehicle division has also joined forces with major carmakers and ride-sharing services to form a coalition to lobby lawmakers and regulators for faster adoption of self-driving car technology. In all, five companies -- Alphabet, Ford, Lyft, Volvo and Uber -- formed the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets coalition. Its mission: to spur the federal government to usurp a "patchwork" of state driving laws that could hinder autonomous vehicle acceptance.

Apple, Amazon and Google are all in the race but who will take the history-making title. By James Billington August 19, 2016 18:21 BST Who will be the world's first trillion dollar company? Apple could be one launch away but is Amazon is a rising threat Reuters The race to become the first trillion dollar company is on and the big three in contention is Apple, Google and Amazon. But which one will cross the line first? It's been widely assumed for many years that Apple would be the favourite to break this barrier with an indomitable rise to the top of the tech tree, but after a recent shift in smartphone sales this has been thrown into doubt. As Apple hits a slight speed bump it's Amazon that's moving up through the pack - even projected to slingshot past thanks to its ventures outside e-retail. Despite ranking some way behind Apple's $582 billion valuation at $365 billion, Amazon's wide-ranging ventures offer a future that gives it a bright future to reach that target. Through its Amazon Web Services, which offers hosting to some of the world's biggest companies, as well as its move into the space race, drone delivery and a logistics service, its moves on the line graph have been heading steadily northwards in 2016. This sharply contrasts Apple, who have endured a shaky downward dive since 2015. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is now the third richest man in the worldReuters In an article by The Motley Fool, however, it believes that despite the slide in iPhone sales all it will take is one big product push from Apple to get it well on-track to hit the $1 trillion mark. But don't hold your breath for that to happen this year. With the 2016 iPhone 7 expected to rock a less than different look and a controversial removal of the headphone socket, which will undoubtedly perturb those millions of consumers who are worried about the fate of their 3.5mm audio cabled headphones. But we're reminded that Apple is still the world's biggest company for a reason. Its Q1 2016 profit result of $18.4 billion is still the highest by any company on record. Ever. Experts recognise the smartphone market is becoming an increasingly more difficult place for Apple but also know its history, expertise and resources are a delicious recipe for success. Its 2018 iPhone, the ten-year anniversary since it first left consumers slack-jawed, is expected to overhaul the handset fans have been waiting for (or expect at every new launch). Rumours of a totally new design and OLED display might just be enough to have consumers gushing once more and if the Apple Car rumblings are to anything to go by it may well be enough to put the wind back into its sails. But, that's still an 'if'. Samsung has taken the game to Apple. Budget, high-quality handsets from the likes of OnePlus have rocked the market. As for the expected electric/autonomous car effort, well there's still the little issue of Audi, Jaguar, Ford, Nissan and Uber to name a few to compete with. Life is a little more secure for Amazon, however. It's already taking home a huge slice of markets where it reigns supreme and doesn't have to look over its shoulder. Estimates that global retail sales will surpass $28 trillion by 2018, and Infrastructure-as-a-service (Iaas) spending will reach $141 billion by 2019. The long-term growth here is something that will power an upward trend for years to come. What about Google? How could we discount Google, its parent company now rebranded as Alphabet. It's currently valued at $538 billion so is by no means a small fish. It's search engine is the internet epitomised, it's behind Android – the most widely used mobile OS in the world – and has been investing in everything from VR to medical tech. Research claims Alphabet will post a rise in profits of 16 percent in the next two years, with revenues of $96 billion in 2018. Its stock is strong and if it continues it could soon become favourite to hit a trillion dollar valuation first. All three companies are dominant players but if money were to be put on the line, experts are backing Amazon based on its diverse portfolio of investments and ventures putting it in a prime position. "To be sure, Apple and Alphabet both offer investors plenty to like, but I see Amazon as the tech company with the most favourable outlook to reach and grossly surpass a $1 trillion valuation in the decades to come," the article read.

Google Trekker is taking on Indiana parks and trails WRTV Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next ZIONSVILLE, Ind. -- Google Trekker is crisscrossing Indiana this summer, mapping out the state's parks and trails. There are 15 cameras inside the Trekker that simultaneously take a photo every 2.5 seconds creating a 360 degree panoramic view. Once they're done in Indiana, it will take 6 to 12 months for Google to process all the images. Faces will be blurred for privacy reasons as well as other identifying images like license plates.  The final product will allow people to actually see Indiana's parks and trails, just like street view on Google maps. Lisa Nye, Executive Director of the Indiana Park & Recreation Association says their goal in bringing the Google Trekker to Indiana has to do with health and sedentary lifestyles, "The Google Trekker program allows us to show Hoosiers all the amazing trails, greenways, waterways and parks available to them in an effort to get citizens to unplug, and go out and get active," said Nye.

But while the Big Four TV conglomerates celebrate single-digit ad-revenue growth, they may want to look outside their sector for a reality check. This story first appeared in the August 16, 2016 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Over the past few months, Facebook has managed to surpass the domestic ad revenue of Comcast, CBS Corp., Disney, and 21st Century Fox. The $13.1 billion that the social-media company and Google brought in together in the second quarter dwarfs the Big Four’s combined take. (Facebook’s domestic data includes Canada, while Google considers the U.S. alone.) Google has always had many times the ad revenue of Facebook, but Facebook is closing the gap at a rapid rate. In fact, it’s the growth rates here that are the most striking. At a 64% trajectory, Facebook grew eight times more than CBS Corp., the fastest-growing entertainment company. At that rate, it won’t be long before Facebook gets to Google’s current scale in the U.S., far surpassing the major TV companies combined. And Facebook’s global ad revenue is twice its domestic take-up. sources: Company Reporting, jackdaw research Analysis One of the big reasons for Facebook’s spike is advertisers’ response to the personalized nature of its advertising. Whereas Facebook can individually target its monthly and daily active user base (226 million in the U.S. and 175 million in Canada at the end of June) based on a granular understanding of their personal characteristics, the major TV companies know far less about their audiences, relying on broad demographics.  The Big Four’s online offerings do a little better in this department. But with an audience fragmented across pay TV, branded sites, apps, and third-party online services like Hulu and Sling TV, it’s impossible for buyers to get a real sense of who TV viewers are, or what their interests might be. Facebook now generates an average of $50 of revenue per year from its users in the U.S. and Canada, up from $34 a year ago and $21 the year before that. But there’s no comparable metric for the TV companies. Another big advantage Facebook enjoys is that some of its ad units generate revenue only if they lead to specific consumer actions. Known in the industry as “attribution,” it’s a feature TV still can’t offer. So while the TV industry toasts itself on a slightly better quarter, Facebook and Google will continue to walk away with a growing slice of the overall ad revenue pie. Put in that context, it’s harder to celebrate the TV industry’s modest achievements.

Searching "how to vote" now brings up an enhanced search feature Millions of Americans are turning to the internet to figure out how to cast their ballots this fall—and online searches related to the election are already much higher than they were in 2012, according to data released by Google. Google searches related to voter registration are up 323% compared to four years ago, led by swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. Vermont, home base of former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, saw the biggest spike in searches related to the election, a rise of 358% compared to 2012. Voter registration data isn’t yet available for this year, but Google’s data offers some early insight into trends. To serve the many people searching for election information, Google has rolled out new features including an enhanced “how to vote” search result launched this week and a “how to register” search result launched earlier in the summer “This is a special election, where we’re seeing a huge increase in the information needs people are coming to us in terms of the election,” said Emily Moxley, Google’s project manager for the “how to vote” search feature. Google often sees a spike in voting-related searches after big news events, like Hillary Clinton’s speech at the Democratic National Convention in July, which coincided with Donald Trump’s condemnation of the father of a fallen Muslim U.S. soldier: There was a 190% increase in voter registration searches compared to the weeks leading up to the convention.

"Under the plain meaning of the Wiretap Act, the 'ordinary course of business' exception protects an electronic communication service provider's interception of email where there is 'some nexus between the need to engage in the alleged interception and the [provider's] ultimate business, that is, the ability to provide the underlying service or good,'" U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh wrote. In 2013, users filed a putative class action against Google, claiming its email service practices violated wiretap laws. Lead plaintiff Daniel Matera claims Google is intercepting and scanning emails for commercial purposes.  Google doesn't totally disagree. Back in 2013, conceded that the snooping is an intrinsic part of its email service, contending that scanning messages is the only way it can keep Gmail free and pay for the cost of maintaining it is through targeted advertising. It has also said that none of this information is read by human eyes, but that it is all machine-scanned. Google also points out that users have agreed to this by signing up to the terms and conditions that must be ticked before you can open a Gmail account.  But in a 38-page order, Koh challenged Google's email interception and scanning policy, noting that it was not necessary or intrinsic to the process of email delivery. Rather, she noted, it is done so solely so Google can sell the data it collects or use it for targeted advertising. While that practice may have merit, Koh said it was simply too soon to rule on it.  "At the motion to dismiss stage, the court cannot say that Google's alleged interception of email is within the 'ordinary course of business' as a matter of law," she noted. In a separate case filed this year, several universities sued Google over its email practices. They argue Google provides email services simply so it can mine the data of students.  Dropsuite Releases Office 365 Back-Up Service Dropsuite just released a new Office 365 email backup and archiving service that it claims has an enhanced end user experience that makes it easier to use. Microsoft Office 365 has more than 60 million monthly active commercial users, with 50,000 small businesses added every month, according to Microsoft reported in July. Office 365 resellers who partner with Dropsuite can offer Dropmyemail to their customers to backup their emails, contacts, calendars and tasks within Office 365. Dropmyemail can also be  integrated into the IT Service Providers’ infrastructure, so small and medium-size businesses (SMB) can buy email backup and archiving with just a few clicks. Dropsuite is a software platform that enables SMBs to backup, recover and protect their digital assets. It offers this service through a network of reseller partners. Nintex Puts Drawloop Doc Generator on Salesforce AppExchange Workflow automation and document generation vendor Nintex just pushed its Drawloop Document Generation application onto the Salesforce AppExchange. It allows users to generate richly-formatted, branded documents inside Salesforce in formats such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint as well as PDFs. It is also optimized  for the Salesforce1 Mobile App, and comes with a component for customers using the Salesforce Lightning Experience. “We’re all about simplifying the document creation process for sales, service, and marketing professionals,” said Jim Roberson, Nintex Drawloop Vice President and General Manager in a statement. He thinks the app will accelerate sales and service processes by automating the creation of sales quotes, order forms, proposals, invoices, contracts, account summaries, service documents and other sales related documents. It also automates data-driven processes that can update record stages, trigger approval routing and additional documents, as well as write data back to Salesforce, schedule tasks, or even create a new record automatically. Based in Bellevue, Wash., 10-year-old Nintex enables IT professionals to create and manage sophisticated business processes.  Microsoft Adds Office Muscle To Edge Browser Microsoft has added a new extension to the Edge toolbar that gives users direct access to all their Office documents and files. Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft and included in the company's Windows 10 operating systems, replacing Internet Explorer. The extension puts an Office icon on the Microsoft Edge toolbar to give users direct access the files whether they are stored online or on the desktop, thanks to integration with OneDrive and OneDrive for Business. The extension allows users to create and open Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Sway documents using Office Online directly from the browser. It also keeps track and surfaces any recent documents that you have opened with Office Online to help you find the documents you need faster.  0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Dropbox Is Reinventing Itself to Win More Love From IT 7 Big Problems with the Internet of Things Simplicity is the Future of Customer Engagement Standardized Processes: Great in Theory, Not in Practice Turn Off Your Printer: It's Almost World Paper Free Day Google Adds Slack Integration to G Suite, More News Dropbox Paper Enhances Collaboration, More Document News Adobe Updates Acrobat DC to Improve Document Editing, Signing Google Drive Search Gets a Natural Language Boost, More News Useful Article?

Featured Story: Amazon's Best Black Friday Tech Deals 2016—TVs, Phones & Tablets Smartphones: help for cell phones, pdas, iphones, android, and more — WonderHowTo How To: Add Your iTunes Library to Google Play Music & Stream Songs from Any Device Dallas Thomas 3 weeks ago How to Add Your iTunes Library to Google Play Music & Stream Songs from Any Device It's always a pain to make sure you have enough storage on your smartphone. Pictures and videos occupy a lot of space, so your music library has to take a back seat—otherwise, you might see that pesky "Storage Full" notification at any time. If you have a large music library, you stand to save quite a few gigabytes of storage by removing the MP3, M4A, and other song file types from your phone and just streaming them from a cloud-based music service instead. This can also serve as a great way to transfer your favorite songs from your iPhone over to a new Android device (or vice versa), as the files are stored on a remote server, and can be accessed from any smartphone. When it comes to cloud-based music streaming, there's no better service than Google Play Music. Without ever paying a penny, you can upload up to 50,000 tracks to Google's rock-solid servers, then stream this music directly to your iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, or Android device. You can even upload your iTunes library to free yourself from Apple Music, and all you need is a Mac or a Windows PC to set things up. Step 1: Find Your Music Folder For most users, this first step should be easy—just locate any MP3s, M4As, or other supported song files that you have saved to your computer's hard drive. If you're going to upload your iTunes library, this folder is pretty easy to find on both Mac OS X and Windows. Finding Your iTunes Library in Mac OS X With a Mac, you can find your iTunes library by opening Finder, then heading to the Users folder and selecting your user name. From here, open the Music folder, then you'll find a subfolder called "iTunes." Keep this finder window open for later, as you'll be dragging and dropping this folder into Google Play Music's web interface. Finding Your iTunes Library in Windows To find your iTunes music folder on a Windows PC, head to the C:\ drive in Windows Explorer, then open the Users folder. From here, open the folder with your name on it, then do the same with the Music folder inside of that. At this point, you should see the iTunes folder clear as day. Step 2: Upload Songs to Google Play Music Google Play Music's web interface only lets you upload songs if you're using the Google Chrome browser. If you don't want to install Chrome, you can download the official Music Manager application and upload songs to Google Play that way instead. Note: All Files Will Be Converted to MP3s Google Play Music lets you upload several different file types (MP3, M4A, OGG, M4P, FLAC, and WMA), but it will convert all of your uploads into the MP3 format along the way. For some of these formats, the conversion process will take some extra time, so be patient. You should also be aware that, while most of your music's metadata will be saved (things like album artwork and artist info), other information, like iTunes ratings and comments, may be lost, as these are not compatible with Google Play Music. Uploading from Chrome Head to the Google Play Music website using Chrome on your computer, then sign into your Google account. From here, click the menu button in the top-left corner of the screen. Next, scroll down to the very bottom of the menu on the lefthand side of your screen, then select the "Upload music" option. At this point, you'll see the "Upload music" menu. If you'd like, you can click the "Select From Your Computer" button to open a file browser menu, which would then allow you to find and select song file folders to upload. However, the easiest way to do this is to simply drag your music folder from Finder or Windows Explorer, then drop it directly on this screen. To do that, just open the two windows side-by-side, then drag the folder over with your mouse or trackpad. The same goes if you're uploading your iTunes music library—just drag the iTunes folder over instead. The upload process can take several hours, depending on how much music you're uploading, so leave your browser open until it's finished. While it's working, you'll see an up-arrow in the bottom-left corner of the screen, complete with a circular progress bar that lets you know how much longer it will take. Uploading from Music Manager If you're using the Music Manager app instead of Chrome, it's even easier. Just open the app up, choose "Upload songs to Google Play" and hit "Continue," then choose where you want to grab the files from. The app can automatically locate your iTunes folder, as well as other music folders and files if you select those options. Just keep following the prompts until it starts uploading your files. Step 3: Stream from the Google Play Music App on Android or iOS Once your music has finished uploading to Google's servers, you can play it at any time from any web browser, or from your iOS or Android device. To start, just install the Google Play Music app for your particular mobile operating system, then sign in with the same Google account you used to upload the music. Install Google Play Music for Android (Google Play Store) Install Google Play Music for iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch (iOS App Store) Once you've done that, you'll see all of your songs mixed in with the free streaming music offered by Google Play. If you'd rather only see the songs you uploaded yourself, head to the side navigation menu in the app, then select "Music library." At this point, you can remove any song files that are stored on your smartphone, as your music has a home in the cloud now—though you can still download tracks to your smartphone for offline playback by "pinning" them in the Google Play Music app. And unlike iTunes Match or Apple Music, an exact copy of the original file is kept on Google's servers, so you don't have to worry about rare recordings being lost or converted into a mainstream version. Streaming your own music library is completely free, so you never have to pay a dime to get this awesome functionality. However, you can sign up for Google Play Music's "All Access" service for $9.99/month to get access to millions of streaming songs and podcasts, seamlessly integrated with your own uploads, which also comes with the ad-free YouTube Red service. In the future, you can add new songs to your library by using the same "Upload music" button on Play Music's website, or using the Music Manger. And if you want to edit any information in a song file, you'll have to do that from the Play Music website; you can't edit file metadata from the mobile apps.

Resend activation e-mail Technology Lab / Information Technology Comcast will offer $70 gigabit Internet in Chicago after all [Updated] Initially, Comcast said it wouldn't match $70 price in non-Google Fiber city. by Jon Brodkin - Aug 19, 2016 3:37 pm UTC Login to bookmark 154 Comcast UPDATE: About three hours after this story published, Comcast told us that the $70 gigabit Internet offer is available in Chicago, contrary to what the company told us this morning. While Comcast didn't promote the $70 price, a spokesperson now tells us customers can get the lower rate on Comcast's website. The deal is $70 for gigabit download speeds and unlimited data, and requires a three-year contract. We've changed the headline, which originally read, "Comcast's $70 gigabit offer is only good in cities with Google Fiber." Obviously, this changes things dramatically, but this is the story as we wrote it before receiving the new information: When Comcast launched its gigabit cable service in Atlanta and Nashville earlier this year, the company offered a $70 monthly price for customers who sign three-year contracts, half off the no-contract "every-day" price. But when Comcast announced gigabit Internet for parts of Chicago this week, the no-contract price of $139.95 was the only one mentioned. The difference, as DSLReports wrote today, is that there's no Google Fiber providing competition in Chicago yet. While Google Fiber has tentative plans to expand to Chicago, its $70 gigabit Internet service is already available in parts of Atlanta and Nashville. Comcast's Chicago announcement said the company "will test promotional pricing during the trial period," but didn't name any specific offers that are better than the $140 no-contract price. When contacted by Ars, a Comcast spokesperson said there is "nothing to announce at this time." The Chicago service may also come with a 1TB monthly data cap, as Comcast has previously only provided unlimited data to gigabit customers who sign a three-year contract. Otherwise, unlimited data costs $50 a month extra. AT&T has taken a similar approach to its gigabit Internet pricing, matching Google's $70 price in cities where both companies operate and charging an additional $40 elsewhere. (UPDATE: It turns out AT&T has changed the price to $90, or $20 more than Google Fiber.) AT&T's lowest price requires opting into a system that tracks your Internet browsing history in order to deliver personalized ads. Unlike Google Fiber and AT&T's GigaPower fiber service, Comcast's gigabit cable doesn't offer symmetrical speeds. New DOCSIS 3.1 (Data over Cable Service Interface Specification) technology dramatically increases download speeds, but the Comcast offering is just 35Mbps upstream. Comcast does have a symmetrical 2Gbps residential Internet service that uses fiber, but it costs $300 a month, with installation and activation fees of up to $1,000. Google Fiber, meanwhile, has been re-evaluating its expansion plans as it considers whether to use high-speed wireless technology instead of fiber.

AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among the members of the 'Robocall Strike Force,' which will work with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.  The group was holding its first meeting with the FCC on Friday. More than 30 major technology companies are joining the U.S. government to crack down on automated, prerecorded telephone calls.  THE ROBOCALL SCOURGE  Hundreds of thousands of people are thought to have suffered from the calls, particularly from personal protection insurance and accident claims companies.  The strike force will report to the commission by Oct. 19 on 'concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,' said AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson, who is chairing the group. The group hopes to put in place Caller ID verification standards that would help block calls from spoofed phone numbers and to consider a 'Do Not Originate' list that would block spoofers from impersonating specific phone numbers from governments, banks or others. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in July urged major companies to take new action to block robocalls, which often come from telemarketers or scam artists.

Share this article Share 55 shares 'This scourge must stop,' Wheeler said on Friday, calling robocalls the No. 1 complaint from consumers. Wheeler has said robocalls continue 'due in large part to industry inaction.' 'The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology,' Wheeler said. Stephenson emphasized 'the breadth and complexity' of the robocall problem. 'This is going to require more than individual company initiatives and one-off blocking apps,' Stephenson said.  'Robocallers are a formidable adversary, notoriously hard to stop.' The FCC does not require phone providers to offer robocall blocking and filtering but has strongly encouraged providers to offer those services at no charge to consumers. The strike force brings together carriers, device makers, operating system developers, network designers and the government. 'We have to come out of this with a comprehensive play book for all of us to go execute,' Stephenson said.  'We have calls that are perfectly legal, but unwanted, like telemarketers and public opinion surveyors. At the other end of the spectrum, we have millions of calls that are blatantly illegal.' Stephenson said technical experts representing the companies have had 'preliminary conversations about short- and longer-term initiatives.' Other companies taking part include Blackberry Ltd, British Telecommunications Plc, Charter Communications Inc, Frontier Communications, LG Electronics Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nokia Corp , Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , Sirius XM Holdings Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and U.S. Cellular Corp.

Google Maps data for China is slightly off due to the country's numerous border disputes with other nations. By Mary-Ann Russon August 19, 2016 16:18 BST Google Maps, together with many other mapping services, are displaying inaccurate information about China in order to help the country preserve its national securityGoogle If a whim takes you to look at China's geography online, you'd be better off avoiding Google Maps, because the information is likely to be slightly off. A river that appears out of nowhere, a border between India and China that is completely different on Indian and world maps, or simply roads that just don't seem to where they should be. You would think that getting a map right would be a piece of cake today with satellite GPS systems and the advent of Google Earth, but for once, the problem has nothing to do with the internet giant. The reason why maps of China are so odd is because the Chinese government considers geographic information about the People's Republic of China to be a matter of national security, so private surveying and mapping activities are illegal in mainland China and have been since 2002. If anyone wants to publish any geographic data concerning the country's air, land and waters, or data relating to any territories that the Chinese government feels is under its jurisdiction, then they must first obtain permission or they will be punished with a fine. In fact, over the last eight years China has fought at least 40 cases of illegal mapping and surveying and issued fines against everyone from Japanese and Korean academic researchers to UK geology students from Imperial College London and all the way up to massive conglomerates like Coca Cola. To that end, if you take your snazzy new digital camera to China and take a picture, when you look at the photo's metadata, you will find almost no location information available, and the only way that any online map provider can have a complete map of China is if they agree to host the data on servers inside China, and if they agree to use a very specific coordinate system. Deliberately inaccurate state-approved coordinate systems For some bizarre reason, a road and most of a river is missing from near the China-India border at Arunachal Pradesh in the Google China map (top), compared to the Google US map (bottom)screenshot by IBTimes UK Digital map services in China use a very specific coordinate system called a geodetic datum that has been specially formulated by the Chinese State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping called GCJ-02. What this means is that an encryption algorithm has been added to the maps to add random offsets to both the correct altitude and longitude of any geographic coordinates. So if you were to look at a Google street map for a specific place in mainland China, the coordinates of the map are offset by between 50-500m away from reality. This doesn't mean that maps are inaccurate within China and that people are constantly walking around scratching their heads however – it's just inaccurate if you look at it from outside the country, the local street map would be accurate, and this is the same with Yahoo Maps as well. And it isn't just restricted to urban and rural areas in the country. If you zoom out and look at the territory of China as a whole, the borders between China and other nations also differ from the same borders details on other maps, such as the crowdsourced OpenStreetMap, which publishes correct coordinates in direct opposition to the government's mandate. That's my territory, not yours Who owns the South China Sea? According to the Chinese government, it does [click to expand]World Defence Review China is currently involved in disputes with eight countries about 14 territories over its correct territorial boundaries, the most of any country in the world, and so the Chinese government is also touchy about any maps that don't reflect the boundaries that it believes in. In fact, as pointed out by statistical blog Metrocosm, if you were to look at the Chinese version of a map of south-east Asia, it looks like China owns pretty much all of the South China Sea, including almost all of the waters around Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines, which affects a number of disputed islands, such as the Scarborough Shoal, which the Philippines maintains belongs to them. Google already has enough trouble with dealing with China over its search engine, so mapping is clearly not an area that it wants to go to battle with the Chinese government over, but following numerous complaints by Filipinos, Google did cave in 2015. China calls the landmass Huangyan Island, while the Philippines knows it as the Panatag Shoal. To avoid legitimising either country's claims, Google changed the maps to remove the Chinese name and instead renamed the island Scarborough Shoal, which is its international name.

In the inaugural “Robocall Strike Force” meeting, the companies will announce their initial plans on how to stop US phone owners from receiving advertorial spam run by automated machines … The AT&T CEO said the 33 companies, which includes tech smartphone giants Google and Apple, will work on solutions to present a concrete plan by October 19 in a couple of months time. Right now, there are no details on what methods the companies have in mind to combat the spam phone calls, or what role Google will play. There is a possibility Google could add technology into Android that can detect robotic spam callers before the user picks up the phone. Although a plan is to be expected by October 19, a prospective date for implementation of the scheme is even more fuzzy. AT&T chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson will make the announcement at the first “Robocall Strike Force” meeting at the FCC later on Friday, the company said. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler in July wrote major companies about robocalls. The strike force will report to the commission by Oct. 19 on “concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,” Stephenson said. “Accelerate the development and adoption” gives no promises about when such changes could come into effect, likely taking many months or years for 33 companies to coordinate with each other. At this stage, it’s not even clear how the stakeholders would achieve such a feat: just like email spam, combatting phone spam is a cat and mouse game. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Seth Weintraub - 3 months ago @llsethj Feature Samsung review Galaxy Note 7 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Admittedly, I haven’t had enough time with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 to be able to get used to it as a daily driver. As with all of the other reviews including Dom’s, we’re under a week in over here. But that doesn’t mean this thing hasn’t blown me away in a lot of respects. Nor does it mean that it is flawless. Today is the first day you can pick it up at Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T in the US and through your favorite retailers, and I know a lot of you have itchy trigger fingers. The question: Should you get this smartphone? The short answer is yes…if… If you are considering the Note 7, you’ve already come to terms with the price which is just about the most expensive thing you can buy in Android-land at almost $900. You probably view the stylus as an advantage. You probably like your phones big – although comparatively, this is the smallest big phone you can find. That slippery curved display is worth it for the extra features, and let’s just be honest here, the wow factor when you show other people. And probably most importantly, you are OK with Samsung’s app ecosystem, the Touchwiz overlay and the carrier add-ons that inevitably come with it. I’m not yet with you there on the last point. I’m still in the Nexus camp when it comes to software. I like the latest OS, clean and simple with only Google apps on the phone by default. Of course Google has been making it easier and easier to get that look and feel with Now and new Nexus launchers and other refinements available through the Play Store. Those are about all of the big caveats I can think of after a few days with the new Note 7. The perhaps one other is that there is a new HTC Nexus phone coming soon that might have some surprise Google features that we haven’t heard about. But I wouldn’t count on it being more whiz bang than the Note 7. The Note 7 is a gorgeous, ‘friends stop what they are doing and take notice’ type of phone. As with the S7, the Note 7s combination of curved glass and microscopic bezels is unlike almost anything out there. Even iPhone owners take notice, just like a Samsung Line-waiters commercial. My biggest beef with Samsung’s S7 is that it still uses a Micro-USB port. While I still have tons of those legacy cables, I’ve moved my desk, car, bedside, batteries, etc. to USB-C so having the S7 is a throwback. We’re now a USB-C society (even Chromebooks and MacBooks use it) and with the Note 7, Samsung is finally now on board. Samsung also included a Fast Charge wireless charger in my review package and it works really well in either portrait or landscape mode. Both charging by USB-C and wireless is super fast, and between fast/easy charging and the 3500mAh battery (x 5V=17.5Wh) battery, this thing is always charged. On battery alone, I had little problem lasting a full day even with heavy usage. Another standout feature on the Note 7 is the Iris scanner which works well but with the fingerprint scanner feels a little redundant. It works better and better –or should I say faster and faster – the more you use it and even works in dark rooms or with glasses on. But if you are pushing the home button anyway, the almost instant fingerprint scanner seems tough to beat in terms of convenient security methods. When it comes to the stylus, I tend to agree with the late great Steve Jobs. I just don’t use it. I can always type faster, especially on the S7’s great keyboard (and the Google Keyboard I replaced it with). Adding words to images and signing my name can be done with my finger just as easy and frankly the process of removing the pen removes any convenience factors the S-Pens adds. However, in limited usage, the now more accurate, smaller tip pen that comes with the Note 7 is fantastic and for those who rely on a stylus, this will be one of the best they’ve used. One thing I wasn’t quite prepared for is how small this big display phone is. Since the screen for intents and purposes spans the whole width, and the chrome on the top and bottom is minimal, this phone is significantly smaller than the Nexus 6 and 6P for instance. It even makes the iPhone 6/s Plus with its much more chrome on all sides seem like a generation or two older. I’m not a fan of the choice of rear material – Gorilla Glass. Besides adding weight to the already dense Note 7, it is breakable and it feels like it gets smudges within seconds of using. Most people will put a case on here but I have to question that decision. The software experience is exactly what you’d expect. Samsung takes Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and puts a bunch of its apps, its overlay and its way of doing things on top. If you are used to this, it is probably not a big deal. For those of us who switch phones often, moving through the OS and finding the right setting can be a hassle. Taking advantage and getting used to Samsung’s add-ons also becomes tedious and something that will come with time. I’ve resolved to try to get used to these this time around. I’ll try Samsung Pay in the coming weeks and maybe even get that S-Pen going. But for now, they don’t enter into my daily needs. Samsung has loaded up plenty of speed with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 and the 4GB of RAM means plenty of apps and browser windows can coexist well. You know the Note 7 is going to be snappy just like you know it is going to have the best camera and best display. Maybe one of the biggest sleeper advantages of the Note 7 is the storage. Mine came standard with 64GB but for $200, you can buy a 256GB MicroSD card to bring the total available storage to a whopping 320GB. If you take 4K video, this becomes a necessity. Wrap up: The smartphone market has matured and every new release no longer has to have a whiz-bang, killer new features. Samsung however has become the Android flagship standard-bearer of the high-end “new”with its Galaxy line, and the Note 7 is the latest and greatest in that family. It is the best you can buy in so many ways. These things aren’t really up for debate: Best Camera. Best screen. Most storage. One of the fastest OS experiences. Sleek, head-turning design. S-Pen Stylus is probably the best pen computing experience you’ll find on a smartphone. It is easily the best Android device you can buy and many believe the best smartphone of any kind. But damn, it is expensive. At close to $1000 retail, that’s up to three times as expensive as the new budget Android flagships that cut one corner or another. Even a Nexus 6P can be found under $400.  The carriers will take some of the edge off by subsidizing the cost and making the upfront fee a more palatable $350. But that Samsung/Carrier experience means you won’t get Android updates as fast as Nexus, you’ll be paying out the wazoo every month and you may not like the extras that get added. Which means there are still compromises to consider. Choose wisely.

We knew then it would be more of a video calling app, separate from Hangouts. It’s for the mobile users who want to video chat instead of just type a message. Before the release, we learned it might be set as default on Android 7.0 Nougat. The Duo video calling app rolled out earlier this week for both Android and iOS not only in the United States but in all countries. In fact, after only a few days of release, it’s now the No. 1 app in the Play Store as reported by Justine Uberti, Google Principal Engineer who was technical lead for Duo and co-leader for Allo. Duo is now available worldwide for both iOS and Android in the Top Free Charts section–ranking ahead of Facebook Messenger, Pokemon GO, Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube Music, and Instagram. More people are expected to download the app over the weekend and especially since after we learned that the Duo app will soon support audio-only calls. The last bit of news is exciting because we have another option for making free calls. There’s no need for those videos when you only want to make quick calls for free. No need to use up your current cellular limit because Duo allows free audio calls between two persons.

Here are a few simple tips for avoiding the wrong apps when you go looking for new ones. By Brandon Vigliarolo | August 19, 2016, 6:08 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Google has a notoriously lax app approval process. There are some positives to allowing easy access to the Play store, but Google's attitude has also left their app store full of dangerous, device-hijacking software. More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter Malicious Android apps usually try to pass themselves off as other legitimate apps, which can leave the average user unable to tell the difference between the two. Here are some tips to help you distinguish the good from the bad. 1. Who's the developer? Every app's page features the developer in plain view directly beneath the name of the app. You might not know offhand who the legitimate developer of an app is, but if the name sounds fishy, is spelled wrong, or isn't capitalized properly you need to investigate further. To check into a developer scroll all the way to the bottom of an app's page on the Play store. Down at the bottom is a link to the developer's website—give it a click to make sure it goes to a legitimate site. SEE: Android Security Bulletin August 2016: What you need to know (TechRepublic) A little above the website link you'll see more apps the developer has published. Those other apps are a good indicator of who you're dealing with—be sure it's not just a bunch of copies of other apps or other junk. Popular apps are some of the most frequently scammed and copied. If you're planning to install one of those keep an eye out for the Google Top Developer icon next to the app developer's name. It appears like a small blue diamond, and it lets you know you're dealing with the right people. 2. Check permissions You can see what permissions an app will need right at the bottom of the screen near the link to the developer's website. All apps need at least some permissions in order to run, and while some need more than others, the permissions an app is asking for should match its function. If you're installing a game it might need to access the internet to pull down data, but there's no good reason for it to attach to your social media, or access your dialer or contacts. It also shouldn't be asking for control over network connections, or to be given access to install other apps. When in doubt trust an app that asks for the least amount of permissions possible. The more it wants the more it's going to worm its way into your phone. 3. What are other users saying? Check the ratings on an app: if it only has a couple stars it probably isn't worth your time, so just pass it up. SEE: Why haven't we seen the smartphone security apocalypse in iPhone and Android yet? (TechRepublic) Make sure you read the comments too—users will report on bad apps, so scan through what people are saying about it. That's not to say that malware developers don't spam the Play store with fake reviews—keep an eye out for five star review after five star review that describe nothing and read in similar ways. Other things you can do Inspecting an app on the Play store can generally distinguish the good from the bad, but there are other things you can do to keep your device safe. Be sure that you disable app installations from unknown sources. Casual Android users probably won't ever have a reason to sideload an APK, so turning it off can protect you from apps outside the Play store. Open Settings, tap on Lock Screen And Security, and look for Unknown Sources. Toggle that off and you'll be all set. Also be sure to install an Android antivirus app. They can detect bad apps and help you get rid of them, as well as protect you from malicious websites and other things that can harm you and your device. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Investigate every app you want to install.

Vetr Crowd Thinks AMD Is Running Hot Cisco, HPE View: Overseas Cash Trumps Cautious Outlooks (Investor's Business Daily) Uber may be the current leader in the autonomous driving race, as its customers can hail a fully automated, self-driving Volvo AB (ADR) (OTC: VOLVY) SUV in a pilot project that will start this month. On the other hand, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and its Google unit are still working on their own autonomous driving vehicle. Google had actually begun working on autonomous cars before the concept of Uber even existed. So how is it that Uber, a much smaller upstart, is beating the behemoth Google in the category? According to Recode, this is a question that Google and its employees are asking themselves. Related Link: Uber's Goal: Replace 1 Million Human Drivers With Robot Drivers ASAP Recode took a shot at answering why Google has been a "laggard to new rivals" in the space. First, Google devoted itself toward making a fully driverless car, which is a "far more difficult feat" given a lack of a steering wheel and other characteristics of a traditional car. Second, Google is in no hurry to rush a product to the market as it doesn't need a new revenue stream to support its business. By comparison, Uber's CEO Travis Kalanick was quoted by Bloomberg as saying autonomous driving vehicles were "basically existential for us." Third, Google may have trouble finding auto partners as manufacturers are skeptical of the type of data and control Google demands as part of an agreement. In the meantime, Google still holds an advantage over Uber and others in areas including machine intelligence, maps and not to mention its Android platform, which serves as a "capacity to distribute software for self-driving cars."

In the inaugural “Robocall Strike Force” meeting, the companies will announce their initial plans on how to stop US phone owners from receiving advertorial spam run by automated machines … The AT&T CEO said the 33 companies, which includes tech smartphone giants Apple and Google, will work on solutions to present a concrete plan by October 19 in a couple of months time. Right now, there are no details on what methods the companies have in mind to combat the spam phone calls, or what role Apple will play. There is a possibility Apple could add technology into iOS that can detect robotic spam callers before the user picks up the phone. Although a plan is to be expected by October 19, a prospective date for implementation of the scheme is even more fuzzy. AT&T chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson will make the announcement at the first “Robocall Strike Force” meeting at the FCC later on Friday, the company said. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler in July wrote major companies about robocalls. The strike force will report to the commission by Oct. 19 on “concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,” Stephenson said. “Accelerate the development and adoption” gives no promises about when such changes could come into effect, likely taking many months or years for 33 companies to coordinate with each other. At this stage, it’s not even clear how the stakeholders would achieve such a feat: just like email spam, combatting phone spam is a cat and mouse game. In iOS 10, Apple has already started along this path with a new extension point for third-party app developers that lets the phone flag up known marketers. At WWDC, Apple advertised this feature in the context of the Chinese region (where phone spam is also very high) but it works worldwide. This is what Craig Federighi is demoing at the keynote in the image above. Phone adds integration for third-party VoIP calls, voicemail transcription and a new caller ID extension for spam alerts. However, Apple has not announced any plans to provide this data itself as of yet. If customers want to take advantage of the new iOS 10 feature, they will have to download third-party apps that offer the underlying database and provide integration with the system. iOS 10 is expected to launch next month in September. We’ll bring more details to follow on Apple’s telephone spam efforts as they are announced. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

(Meet the man behind Sindhu's success) Olympics special site; Photo gallery "Following her sensational move against world number 6 Nozomi Okuhara in the semi-finals of the women's badminton singles, PV Sindhu was the top searched Indian athlete, followed by debut medallist Sakshi Malik," Google said. (Sindhu's final start time, TV info) PV Sindu in action at Rio Olympics Other top Searched Indian athletes in the last three days were Srikanth Kidambi (badminton), Dipa Karmakar (gymnastics) who secured fourth position, Sania Mirza (tennis), Saina Nehwal (badminton), Vinesh Phogat (wrestling), Lalita Babar (long distance running), Vikas Krishan Yadav (boxing) and Narsingh Pancham Yadav (wrestling). While overall badminton and wrestling remained the top searched sports by Indians, interest in athletics and gymnastics was boosted by some thrilling performances by the players in the Olympics. "India is currently ranked 11th in the global trends in terms of searches for the 'Olympics' over the last seven days," the statement said. Indians also showed a great deal of excitement for Jamaican Sprinter and World's fastest man Usain Bolt, who remained the most searched foreign athlete on Google India. Apart from Bolt, other top searched foreign players being searched by Indians in the last three days include Chinese badminton player Lin Dan who defeated Srikanth Kidambi, Nozomi Okuhara of Japan who lost to PV Sindhu, swimming great from the US Michael Phelps and Chinese badminton player Wang Yihan. Meanwhile, people of the North Eastern states appear to be more interested in the Rio Olympics compared to other states of the country, according to an analysis by Google. Six North Eastern states - Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Meghalaya, Manipur, Sikkim and Nagaland - have emerged as the top six Indian states from where netizens have extensively searched Google for information on Rio Games, the Google statement said. The remaining four positions in the Top 10 list have been occupied by Goa, Puducherry, Haryana and Uttarakhand, it said.

The study’s findings proved, without a doubt, that consumer engagement skyrockets when ads are personalized, yielding on average 3X the performance of standard display ads. “Personalization has fundamentally changed how marketers engage with customers, and is shifting the very foundation of the digital advertising market,” said Diaz Nesamoney, CEO of Jivox (pictured top left). “By replacing the industry’s traditional cost-per-thousand insertion model with an ‘always on’ paradigm, personalized ads offer brands significantly higher – and more predictable – revenue streams. This is a game-changing innovation for the industry with immense power to drive a business at scale.” The 2016 Jivox Benchmark Report examined more than one billion personalized ad impressions from 24 real-world ad campaigns, conducted by brands across six industries and delivered within 10 major global markets. Specifically, the study sought to quantitatively measure the impact on performance of ad campaigns delivered using real-time data signals, or triggers, in combination with first-party, audience and contextual data. Campaign performance was measured against three Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) – Click Through Rate (CTR), Interaction Rate (IR) and Average Dwell Time (ADT) – and compared to Google’s display ad benchmark for rich media, the industry standard for measuring online ad performance. Key Findings The study revealed enormous growth in consumer engagement when ads were personalized, yielding on average 3X performance gains over standard display ads: Click Through Rate. A commonly used measurement of ad performance, Click Through Rate (CTR) determines how often individuals who see an ad end up actually clicking on it. On average, the personalized digital ads from Jivox’s study delivered a CTR that was 230% higher than (or 3.3X) the Google display ad benchmark for rich media creative. Interaction Rate. Also known as Engagement Rate, the Interaction Rate (IR) measures the level of interaction while users are viewing an ad impression. The personalized ads from Jivox’s study achieved an IR that is 84% higher than (or 1.8X) the Google display ad benchmark for rich media creative. Average Dwell Time. By calculating the length of time individuals engage with an ad, Average Dwell Time (ADT) measures how successfully that ad captured user attention. A significant measurement, ADT directly correlates with an ad’s conversion rate, or its ability to achieve a desired user action. On average, the personalized digital ads from Jivox’s study achieved an ADT that is 28% higher than (or 1.3X) the Google display ad benchmark for rich media creative. “The numbers are staggering, and offer hard evidence of what up to now has been conventional wisdom among marketers: personalization drives massive performance gains in digital advertising,” said Nesamoney. “Personalized marketing certainly isn’t a new idea. But we believe brands are just on the cusp of realizing its promise with the recent emergence of modern data-driven ad technology platforms and the unprecedented availability of data to power campaigns. This is truly a new paradigm in marketing.” The Jivox report also examined six popular data “triggers” used for personalizing digital ads – Weather, Demographics, Retargeting, Geography, Language and Time – and analyzed their impact on overall ad performance. Additionally, the study revealed how data triggers impacted ad performance differently within specific vertical industries.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Google Duo 1-to-1 Video Calling App For iOS, Android Released – Direct Download Links By Uzair Ghani Posted Aug 16, 2016 42Shares Share Tweet Submit Google Duo, the 1-to-1 video calling app which the search engine giant showed off at Google I/O 2016 has been released for both iOS and Android. Google Duo Arrives For iOS & Android – Will Roll Out Worldwide In The Days To Come When it comes to video calling, Google has tried a number of times to make its formula work. But so far, the company has managed to ruffle a few feathers if not more. But at Google I/O 2016 it was fairly evident that the company has figured out how to make things work, and hence Duo’s foundation was laid down, with the company promising to release the app to the public during Summer time. Fast forward to today and Google Duo app for iOS, Android is finally available for download. And as you’d expect, it’s absolutely free. Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person, but too often it can be a frustrating or complicated experience. You shouldn’t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are. It’s no wonder that nearly half of us never make video calls on mobile*. Today, we’re releasing Google Duo — a simple 1-to-1 video calling app available for Android and iOS. Duo takes the complexity out of video calling, so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are. Advertisement Google Duo is packed with a lot of fun features that make video calling a worthwhile experience. For instance, Knock Knock gives you a glimpse of the caller even before you pick up the call so you know exactly what sort of situation you’ll be dealing with. Furthermore, things go straight through the roof when you realize Duo offers brilliant video quality that adjusts itself even on slower networks (WiFi and cellular both). Microsoft Pix Is A New Artificially Intelligent Camera App For Your iPhone Those who are into privacy a lot will be pleased to learn that calls are end-to-end encrypted. This means no one will be able to trace down your bad joke. So we’ll give Google a double thumbs up on that. Where To Download Google Duo As we mentioned above, Google Duo is available for free on both iOS and Android. But do keep in mind it might not be available in your region as the rollout is gradual. Give it a few days and everything will be there for you to try out.

For now, the functionality is still limited to only a specific collection of devices, but ahead of a wider release, Google has been slowly streamlining the experience. In the latest Canary release, M54 (via ChromeStory), Google has made some minor tweaks to the design of Chrome OS, starting with the “all apps” icon and the app tray. One of the first things you’ll notice is that the “all apps” icon has switched from the well-known grid icon to a new, very simple, circular icon. Along with that, you’ll also notice that the app tray now hosts two rows of apps rather than just one. This is undoubtedly related to Android apps as it gives users easier access to their more frequently used applications. Along with these two tweaks, Google has also changed how notifications look in Chrome OS with new notification icons on the notification tray. The cards also have a tweaked design. In bigger news, Google has also added support for background sync for apps such as Gmail. This is definitely a huge benefit for those using the app on a Chromebook as it will no longer need to be open in the background for notifications to sync. For now these changes are limited to the latest Canary update, although they should make their way to the stable channel over time, especially as more Chromebooks gain access to Android apps.
