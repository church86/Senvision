By Avi Salzman Feb. 10, 2017 5:28 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Expedia posted decent earnings on Thursday, but said some Google practices are presenting a challenge. Photo: Bloomberg News Like other Internet companies, Expedia appears to have a Google problem, and the search engine’s expanding reach could weigh on results in coming quarters. Google, owned by the Alphabet corporation, has been launching its own travel tools in recent years. In 2015, it began allowing users to book hotel rooms using Google’s interface (though the transactions were processed by third parties), and last year it released the Google Trips app that gathers travel information from users’ Gmail accounts. The search giant has also made it harder for other companies to get free exposure from searches in some cases. Google expanded the amount of spots for its paid desktop search options last year. At times it has gotten more aggressive in promoting its own services when people search, coaxing them to explore Google’s travel options first instead of immediately directing them to Priceline or Expedia. That leaves less room for other brands to promote their offerings directly. Google already has a $12 billion travel business, compared to less than $9 billion for Expedia, according to travel news and research site Skift. Much of Google’s travel-related revenue comes from charging online travel sites like Expedia to advertise. But even if Expedia is a valued Google customer, it is also a competitor, and CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has made it clear that Google has been a challenge for its HomeAway vacation rental business. Google has taken “more and more of their screen space and monetizes that screen space,” Khosrowshahi said on a conference call following the company’s fourth quarter earnings release on Thursday. “But players like ourselves don’t have much of a choice because of Google’s market power.” Big Picture: Expedia could see a growing threat from Google’s expanded travel business.

 As promised, Oracle just filed its appeal in its massive case against Google Julie Bort Feb. 10, 2017, 7:23 PM 5,093 facebook linkedin twitter email print Oracle's Larry Ellison and Safra Catz AP If you thought the loss Oracle suffered in May in its ongoing lawsuit against Google over Android was the end, think again. As promised, Oracle is appealing the case, and filed its appeal today. The two tech giants have been battling it out for years in two separate court cases over whether Google must pay Oracle billions of dollars for bits of code copied from Java (a programming language Oracle owns) and used in Android (the language Google controls). At issue were bits of code called application programming interfaces (APIs), the technology that allows different computer programs to talk to each other. While there's been back and forth over the years, with one side winning or losing various stages of the fight, the upshot is, Google has yet to be found liable for paying Oracle for Java, much less the massive, multi-billion dollar fine Oracle dreams of. Chilling effect In May, the two companies were in court arguing over what amount, if anything, Google owes after an earlier trial found that Google did in fact copy some of the Java code. Google argued that the copying fell within the "fair use" provision of copyright law, meaning Google was free to use it. A jury of 10 unanimously agreed with Google. Oracle vowed to appeal and here we are. In the appeal filing, seen by Business Insider, Oracle argues that the jury in May didn't get to hear all of the facts it wanted to share. Those facts included all the ways it believes Android harms Java, including how Android might one day usurp Java's role in its primary domain, as a language used to create apps and Web apps for PCs.  Oracle's lawyers argue in the appeal filing: “Google started trial knowing a fact it kept secret from everyone else: It was days away from announcing that 'the full functionality of Android would soon be working on desktops and laptops, not just on smartphones and tablets.'”   Many in the tech industry have been watching this case closely. Critics argue that a big fine for Oracle could have a chilling effect on some of the ways that software developers freely use and share code today. Google is not commenting on the appeal, although it did send Business Insider its original statement when it won the jury case in May. "[The] verdict that Android makes fair use of Java APIs represents a win for the Android ecosystem, for the Java programming community, and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products."

(YouTube) The Scroll OK, Google: Show Me Inclusion Why Google’s Super Bowl ad, which included a mezuzah, is an important metaphor for America By Marjorie Ingall The Scroll OK, Google: Show Me Inclusion Why Google’s Super Bowl ad, which included a mezuzah, is an important metaphor for America By Marjorie Ingall February 9, 2017 • 2:04 PM Did you miss the Google Home Super Bowl ad with the mezuzah in it because you were hanging out with activist rabbis instead of watching the game? Me, too! The ad didn’t attract a lot of notice. It first appeared online last October, and when it finally aired on TV it got more attention for making viewers’ own Google Home devices go crazy than it did for its content. (Apparently Google Home devices heard “OK, Google” repeated over and over from the TV, got confused, and acted out.) A writer for The Verge observed, “At some point, some enterprising TV writer or ad jerk is gonna plant an ‘OK Google’ into some TV with intent and force everyone to listen to Nickelback.” But, fellow yehudim, consider the ad itself. It opens with an aerial shot of a bus on a winding road. We hear the first wistful notes of a wordless, gentle instrumental version of John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads.” Then there’s a house with a rainbow flag (!) and wait, don’t get scared and change channels, look at the generic blond woman getting out of a taxi! And ooh, a cute dachshund looking out a window and whimpering eagerly for its person! And a sweet wholesome hetero fam with a sleeping toddler entering a suburban home through a tidy garage! Are you heteronormatively chill? Good! Here’s a shot of a mezuzah on a doorpost as a shoulder passes by! Ha! It’s the Jews, just 15 seconds after the gays! Shh, chill some more, look at the pretty white girl with a cello case in the rain entering her house, telling Google Home, “Turn on the hall lights.” Thanks, Google Home! Now there’s a little girl of color excitedly greeting her daddy! Oh, you’re cool, straight white Christian viewer; you’re not discomfited by the African-American dude saying “OK Google, turn up the music” and some dancing! You can do the Nae Nae! Look, there’s a Southeast Asian woman saying “OK Google, what’s a good substitute for cardamom?” Relatable! You don’t have cardamom in your spice rack either! And now it’s another cute wee brown girl giggling as her not-in-the-frame dad says, “OK Google, what sound does a whale make?” Oh, and this sweet elderly white lady asking “How do you say ‘nice to meet you’ in Spanish?” Google Home tells her, so when she opens the door to greet and hug a wholesome young Latino couple, she’s ready! Then there’s a quick montage of a bunch of Google Homes getting asked questions, then a big party of people of many races, and cake that says “Welcome Home,” and “OK Google, dim the downstairs lights!” And all the attractive multicultural people hide, and aw, it’s getting all soft-focus-y as people yell (but, like, gentle-yell) “Welcome home!” Reductive? Sure. But for me, seeing that mezuzah triggered the same feeling as spotting a friend in the crowd during a televised baseball game. I know you! It was a smidgen of what I felt during Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s JAP Battle, despite my agita about the term JAP and my dismay at stereotypes. Seeing my people represented—in such an in-group kind of way, with references many goyim would miss—was thrilling. We’re so seldom invited to the party, and here Google didn’t go for the obvious kippah or Shabbat candles, but the lesser known mezuzah. It’s like they know us! Not everyone I talked to about it felt the same way. One of my colleagues sniffed, “It’s using the perception of being inclusive to sell stuff. It’s pretty meh to laud companies just for using multiculturalism to build their brand. I mean, donate money, Google! Use your massive international clout to create a more tolerant world in a meaningful way! Provoke change!” I see where he’s coming from. But wasn’t it telling that so many big-game ads were tagged “liberal”? Coca-Cola re-ran its multi-language “America the Beautiful” spot. Airbnb showed tight close-ups of a variety of different folks of different ages, with different skin colors, along with the hashtag #WeAccept and text making that explicit: “We believe no matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love, or who you worship, we all belong.” The company’s founder and CEO tweeted that Airbnb pledged to provide short-term housing for the next five years to a hundred thousand people who need it, starting with refugees, aid workers and disaster survivors. The spot that caused the most controversy, Budweiser’s story of its founder’s immigration journey, took a year to produce. In other words, it was being storyboarded long before Trump took office. And the CEO of the lumber company that produced an ad supportive of legal immigration is a Republican Trump supporter. But all these ads convey a sense of the commandment ahavat ha’ger—love the stranger. To put it bluntly, I think there’s a feeling in the air of not wanting to be a dick. We’re yearning for connection, for bridge-building. There were even fewer sexist commercials this year than in past years. (The most provocative ads were a duo of self-aware, feminist, funny spots for T-Mobile, in which comedian Kristen Schaal enjoys a sadomasochistic relationship with Verizon. Any pussy-grabbing this character is involved in is clearly safe, sane, consensual and replete with riding crops.) Commercials are always about us as much as the product they’re selling. They’re about how we want to see ourselves, what we believe, who we love or hate, where we see our place in a wider world. I majored in folklore and mythology in college, so you’ll excuse me a flight of fancy: Commercials are similar to myths, which Joseph Campbell called “public dreams.” Campbell believed that the imagery in myths, like dreams, reveal “the deepest hopes, desires and fears, potentialities and conflicts, of the human will… Every myth, that is to say, whether or not by intention, is psychologically symbolic. Its narratives and images are to be read, therefore, not literally, but as metaphors.” The commercials we love and remember involve a brand tapping into our own longings and ways of viewing the world. I saw a mezuzah and felt welcomed. And that’s a big deal.

Samsung’s Chromebook Pro highlights the category’s continued evolution Posted 20 hours ago by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story WeChat users in China can now gift friends a Starbucks coffee via chat Advertisement Chromebooks hit a key milestone last May, outselling Macs in the US for the first time ever, by IDC’s account. It was a pretty big win for a category oft maligned at launch for its relative lack of functionality. And while the devices are, perhaps, not fully mainstream, they’ve had an impressive rise over the last couple of years. If you haven’t had much experience with one, it’s a pretty safe assumption that you haven’t spent much time in a classroom recently. Extremely competitive price points coupled with rugged designs have made the category extremely appealing for school, a sector that has served as the driving force in the products. But have the devices seen enough progress to justify purchase after graduation? Announced at CES back in January, Samsung’s two new Chromebooks serve as a good signpost for how far the category has come in the five-and-a-half years since it was first launched, coupling offline functionality with a newfound access to Google Play, opening the laptop up to a sea of Android apps. That coupled with a convertible form factor and the very Samsung-esque inclusion of a stylus (née S-Pen) make for one of the more compelling Chromebooks in recent memory. Chromebook by its cover The Chromebook is fairly simple as the name implies, with two pancaked pieces drawn together by large silver hinges. It’s an unassuming looking thing – more or less what you’d expect from a budget system. The “Platinum Silver” coloring is nice enough to look at, though the finish scuffed extremely easily as I ported it around town in my backpack, so you’ll probably want to pick up a devoted case for the thing. Like the (vastly more expensive) new MacBooks, Samsung’s Chromebook aims for port homogeneity, with a single USB-C on either side, which can be used to charge the device, plug in accessories and stream to and charge a 4K monitor, if you really want to get fancy with your $449 Chromebook. There’s a headphone jack and microSD slot on the left; volume rocker, power button and stylus housing are on the right. Two small speaker grilles are positioned on the underside of the Chromebook, elevated from the desk by a quartet of rubber feet.The system is 0.55-inches thick, weighing in at 2.38 pounds – that’s a bit thicker and heavier than a MacBook, but certainly portable enough to pop into a backpack. The keyboard is a bit cramped – taking a bit of getting used to if you’re making the jump from something full size – but it’s pretty easy to adapt. Ditto for the keys, which are a bit on the soft side. The track pad is fairly small as well, and a bit laggy on the default setting – though between the touchscreen and on-board stylus, there’s really no lack of methods for interacting with the system. Sound and Vision Latest Crunch Report Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Samsung’s new Chromebooks sport a 12.3 inch display that clocks in at 2,400 x 1,600, making it Quad HD – and markedly higher-res than recent comparable offers from the likes of Dell, Acer and ASUS. Honestly, it’s a really great display for the price point. Granted, these devices are largely positioned for business/education, but the inclusion of Google Play access really opens the system up to a slew of entertainment options. Coupling that with a sharp and bright display makes the system that much more appealing for users looking for a solid utility player at a good price. And then, of course, there’s the 360-degree hinge, which turns it into a (albeit thick) slate or lets the keyboard double as a kickstand for movie viewing. The built-in accelerometer also means you’ll be able to utilize movement for mobile gaming, in the case of titles that require you to tilt a handset for gameplay. The speakers, meanwhile, are nothing to write home about – as you’d no doubt expect from the category. They do get plenty loud, however, so they’ll probably do for a little music listening or watching an episode or two of a show. Otherwise, you’ll probably want to look into some headphones or a Bluetooth speaker. Beyond the Chromebook The addition of the Google Play store is definitely the nicest new feature for this latest generation Chromebook. Native support will be coming across the line, but for now, Samsung’s devices are one of the few places you can get the functionality. It’s a great addition and a quick fix to the ongoing issue of Chrome OS app selection. If it’s in the Play Store, you can download it, though, as with any convertible, it’s important to remember that a lot of the apps aren’t optimized for the form factor. In most cases that’s only a minor inconvenience when factoring in all of the functionality it opens up. The system is currently in beta (it will be live when the system is available at retail in April), but I didn’t encounter any major issues. And, of course, it wouldn’t be a new Samsung product without the addition of a stylus that tucks neatly into the product’s side. The company’s been careful to point out that, while the hardware is the same, this is emphatically not an S-Pen – a distinction is draws not so much because of the Note connection as the software it utilizes. As the company points out the S-Pen is part of a very specific mobile software suite. Instead, the company worked directly with Google to create a hardware software experience designed to provide a more seamless writing/drawing experience with the input device. And it largely delivers, utilizing a predictive algorithm that helps reduce the lag, creating a smooth experience.

Website http://www.google.com/chrome Full profile for Google Chrome Like the S-Pen, the stylus immediately triggers an on-screen pop up when you pull it out. From there, you can capture screen shots, utilize the tool in a presenter mode or open a new note. The on-board functionality is fairly basic – probably not advanced for anyone who wants to create serious artwork on the thing, but those often take notes by hand will find the stylus a nice addition. In its current form, it’s not really enough to make or break the device for most users, but it’s a nice feature to have. Plus or Pro Samsung’s two new Chromebooks are virtually identical inside and out. You’ll find a decent 4GB of RAM, coupled with 32GB of storage. That’s not much for a notebook, granted, but it’s a step in the right direction as Chromebooks continue to expand their offline functionality. The systems also support a MicroSD slot on the side, so you’ll be able to expand that a bit, particularly handy with all that new app access. The battery life is rated at eight hours, and indeed, I found I was able to get a solid day’s use out of the system without plugging it in. Not the best in the laptop business, but certainly enough for most real world uses. The only real difference between the systems is small but important. The Plus features an ARM processor – similar to what you’ll find on a mobile device, while the Pro sports and Intel m3. That alone is enough to justify the price difference between the systems –$499 vs. $549. In a sense, it also represents a symbolic divide between older Chromebooks and ones with full-fledged laptop aspirations. The decision to upgrade depends entirely on what you’re hoping to accomplish with the system. If you’re looking at the Chromebook as a simple secondary device to complement your daily laptop driver, the Plus should serve the purpose. If you’re expecting the system to do some real computing, you’re going to kick yourself for not spending the extra $100 to upgrade. Chrome sweet Chrome If early Chromebooks (understandably) put you off the space, you may be overdue for a revisit. The category has come a ways since the first generation, transforming from a machine defined by its limitations into a legit low-cost computing device – it’s a transformation furthered by the addition of Google Play. Samsung’s new Chromebooks aren’t exceptional, so much as they are a good signpost for that progress. The devices are low cost, capable and have a number of welcome hardware additions like the hi-res, 360-degree display. 0 SHARES Featured Stories Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report VIDEO | 2:38 | Crunch Report Carl Bass on his surprising Autodesk exit — and what’s next 13 hours ago | Connie Loizos Uncorking innovation with Treasury Wine Estates in Napa 14 hours ago | Lora Kolodny Beats X bring Apple’s wireless headphone tech to a tethered form factor 15 hours ago | Brian Heater Facebook says it will open up for independent ad audit 18 hours ago | Anthony Ha Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report: Prince returns to Spotify 9 hours ago | Anthony Ha Weekly Roundup: Tech companies rally against Trump’s immigration ban, Zenefits cuts workforce again 10 hours ago | Anna Escher Trump’s immigration ban is terrible for entrepreneurs 10 hours ago | Samia Bahsoun Payback’s a gift 11 hours ago | Talia Goldberg, Jeremy Levine Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Advertisement Comment moderation powered by Up Next WeChat users in China can now gift friends a Starbucks coffee via chat Posted 20 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings Data Migration Consultant at Exerp (West Palm Beach, FL, United States) Integration Consultant at Exerp (West Palm Beach, FL, United States) SENIOR ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE at Waxman Strategies (Washington, DC, United States) Senior Backend Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Senior Data Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 February 2017 by Military News Owner of Isenselogic.com Talks About how YellowPages.com’s causes Small Businesses to loose search rankings. David Meshach – Owner of Isenselogic.com recently talked about how YellowPages.com could be responsible for billions of dollars in lost revenue for local businesses. He in-depth discussed how YellowPages.com  creates bad links in their sponsored ad section that causes Google to penalize their websites.  It is shocking that Google would consider a well know company like Yellowpages as spam links but this isn’t the first time it has happened. See http://jasonmun.com/links-yellowpages-unnatural-according-google/ David describes how Google gives special preferences to local businesses that have a physical address.  They scour the internet looking for information about this business based on their address, phone number and business name.  This is commonly referred by SEO experts as the NAP. Which is short for Name, Address and Phone Number. When Google detects signals that do not match the (NAP) it causes a penalty in search rankings.  When Yellowpages.com uses its advertising plan for small businesses it creates links from other cities that the business doesn’t belong to thereby causing bad NAP signals. While talking about YellowPages.com’s bad links David Meshach has shared the story of Auto Repair Tacoma; how they lost a lot of their clients and their top ranking on Google’s first page which ultimately caused them a huge loss; and by the time that they realized that they are losing a lot of customers because of YellowPages.com, it was too late and they already had their search engine ranking and face a massive drop in sales. David Meshach stated: “I would advise you to watch your search rankings, and check references of any company offering to get you ranked higher on Google and keep an eye on your backlinks”. David highly emphasizes on selecting a good digital marketing company for Bellevue Search Engine Optimization and Bellevue Website Design because only a trustable company that has an extensive experience can actually serve what they promise.

Yet Chromebooks have defied expectations and made major inroads in an unexpected environment -- U.S. schools. In retrospect, that shouldn't be too surprising. Chromebooks are cheap and easy to manage, making them popular with budget-constrained schools with limited tech-support staff. And Wi-Fi is now common enough in U.S. schools and homes to make an internet-dependent device practical for students. Google doesn't want to stop there. It's releasing new models in partnership with Samsung that are designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers. They have several tablet-like features, including a stylus, touch controls and a 360-degree hinge that allows you to turn the screen faceup. One starts selling Sunday for $449; a more powerful version comes out in April for $100 more. Google and its manufacturing partners are trying to shed the Chromebook's perception as underperforming budget devices. But even with premium models, expanding beyond U.S. schools won't be easy. Chromebooks get schooled For personal computers and tablets, Chromebook's share of the U.S. education market was 49 percent last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2013, according to IDC figures released this week. But education accounts for just 14 percent of the 110 million devices shipped in the U.S. last year -- and Chromebooks make up just 9 percent of that broader total. Their numbers are also low abroad, even in schools. The Chromebook's popularity in U.S. education is also largely limited to grades K-12, analysts say. Macs and Windows laptops are still dominant on college campuses. Rough start Chromebooks use a lightweight operating system designed to get people online faster, without having to wait around for the computer to start up. Much of the heavy lifting on Chromebooks gets done on Google's remote servers, so Chromebooks themselves don't need fast chips or lots of storage. Early on, though, that made Chromebooks seem cheap and underpowered, which "soured consumer expectations right off the bat," IDC analyst Linn Huang said. Online storage for photos and documents online was much less common in 2011 when Chromebooks launched, so their limited local storage was initially unappealing. And the few apps available for Chromebooks didn't work offline, at least at the time. Differing needs But what constrains consumers can actually be liberating in education. Most kids don't need laptops on the bus or other locations where they can't connect to Wi-Fi. And they don't miss business software like Microsoft Office; Google's online apps for documents and spreadsheets do just fine for homework. "What surprised us was how quickly it took off in education," said Kan Liu, who oversees Chromebooks at Google. Apple's iPad was hot at the time, but Google sold the Chromebook on convenience. They're easier for classrooms to share; just sign in with a Google account, and a student's apps and documents instantly appear. Teachers also have online tools to lock down what apps and sites students can use. And with models available for less than $200, schools can get a few Chromebooks for the price of an iPad or a rival laptop. "It allows us to put more devices in students' hands," said Aaron Slutsky, chief technology officer for McDowell County Schools in North Carolina. Far from universal But Chromebook's success story in schools is largely an American one, and it's likely to stay that way. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa notes that Chromebooks are useless in China because the device depends on Google services that aren't available there. And in emerging countries, where a budget laptop would be ideal, she said internet access isn't reliable enough. Even in the U.S., the iPad is better for many creative tasks such as recording and editing movies. Students studying engineering, robotics and graphics won't be able to use Chromebooks to run the kind of specialized software that's available for Macs and Windows laptops. "But that's not needed for 98 percent of our students," said Tracy Dabbs, coordinator of technology and innovation at the Burlington-Edison School District near Seattle. Many school districts limit Apple and Windows computers for the students who specifically need them, then provide Chromebooks for the rest. McDowell County, for instance, has 5,500 Chromebooks, 1,200 iPads -- and only 100 Macs and 200 Windows PCs. Rivals stage a comeback Last year, Apple gave iPads in schools some Chromebook-like features unavailable to the general public. That includes ways to let multiple people use a single tablet and management tools for tech-support staff. A new Classroom app lets teachers control what apps students run and track their progress. Apple also provides classroom tools for teachers and students. Free e-books offer teachers step-by-step guides on using iPad apps and curriculum suggestions for everyday subjects. A separate app lets kids learn programming using the same language developers use to build iPad apps. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced last month new online apps and management tools for schools, along with Windows PCs priced similarly to Chromebooks. Beyond schools Huang said some businesses are giving Chromebooks a second look, especially in retail, banking and other settings where people share computers. But in many offices, the lack of business software such as Office is a major hurdle. Google's alternative lacks many advanced capabilities found in Office, and habits are hard to change. Google is trying to make Chromebooks more palatable by letting them run Android apps designed for phones and tablets. It's testing this capability on a handful of Chromebook models, including the new ones from Samsung. That makes it possible to install Office, Adobe Photoshop and many apps on a Chromebook, though these tablet versions have limited features compared with versions for Macs or Windows laptops.

The good news is that it will become available to the Nexus 5X and 6P models soon enough. Stephen Hall, from 9to5 Google, reported that the smartphones will get access to the famous Google Assistant along with their next important update. He tweeted this information and everybody went crazy about it. Up until now, the Google Assistant was a feature that appeared exclusively on the Pixel and Pixel XL devices. Other devices, such as Google Home and the Google Allo app were also compatible with it. The company has also released the Assistant Developer Platform to developers for third-party apps, and so they win by expanding the user base of this particular feature and improving its machine-learning possibilities, while at the same time satisfying a good share of its clients. Through their development of such an assistant, it is clear that they want to compete with the rival Siri, the digital assistant produced by Apple, or the Cortana one made by Microsoft. Steve Cheng, who is a product management director at the Assistant, declared that in time, they plan to bring this important feature to as many users as they can. Despite their ambitious plans, one problem might be the fact that not all the devices have the required hardware for OK Google compatibility. As such, we don’t know whether the Assistant would become available on mid-budget Android devices, and not even all the high-end ones might not support it. Up until now, Google confirmed that they will bring the feature to Android TV devices found in the US soon enough. Besides, it seems that the feature will also be “exported” to the LG G6 competitor, set to be released at the MWC event in Barcelona.

Many are being tempted to change their Nexus to a Pixel device, but hold on! Now you don’t need to upgrade the hardware anymore, since the software will receive a much anticipated feature: the Google Assistant. Up until now, the AI assistant that goes under the name of Google Assistant was available only for Pixel and Pixel XL models. The voice-activated feature seems to become more widely used now, since Google is currently releasing it to Nexus devices too. Stephen Hall, who works at 9to5 Google, announced on Twitter that he knows about the arrival of this much wanted feature to the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P through an important update. Even though it is awesome that the Assistant will become available for other devices too, it is not the first feature that started out as being exclusive to Pixel and then extended to other Nexus phones. According to a report published by Engadget, the latest update available for Nexus 5X also brought it the fingerprint swipe gesture, which was initially available just for Pixel. The feature lets you swipe up and down on the fingerprint sensor if you want to see your notifications and scroll through them. Mashable also reported that Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P aren’t the only ones which are being spoiled by the tech giant. As it seems, The Android TV feature from the Nexus Player and the Android Wear 2.0 devices will also be getting the update with the Google Assistant. Moreover, even the LG G6 from the rival company will enjoy this amazing feature that competes with the Siri assistant from Apple.

Via 9to5Google, both phones are currently in stock at the Google Store. For the Pixel, only the 32GB model is in stock but it’s available in Very Silver, Quite Black and Really Blue finishes. As for the deluxe Pixel XL, models with a Really Blue finish are unavailable but the Google smartphone can be purchased in 32GB or 128GB variants. Pricing remains the same for both Pixel variants. Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, which launched last fall, are the company’s push to make a fully first-party flagship phone. The Pixel and Pixel XL are priced in line with comparable premium smartphones like Apple’s iPhone and respectively come in 5-inch and 5.5-inch models. Within the U.S., the Pixel is exclusively available through Verizon Wireless, but it can also be purchased directly from the Google Store or Best Buy. Related Stories Google Pixel 2 Series Phones May Be Water-Resistant Google Struggles With Pixel, Pixel XL Supply While the Pixel series earned strong reviews upon its release, Google has struggled to keep up with demand for the phone. Immediately after its launch and even in January, reports appeared about the phone being unavailable and out of stock. The current inventory reload isn’t without its blind spots, but at least models are available to purchase. The Google Pixel 2 isn’t expected to be released soon, but the premium Android smartphone market will become much more crowded in the next few months. The LG G6 will drop in late February, while the Samsung Galaxy S8 is slated to be released in April. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Google is planning on cracking down on a number of apps that are known to cause problems, including knock-offs of popular apps and apps with outdated privacy policies. Word of the crackdown comes from an email sent from Google to app developers that was first unearthed by The Next Web. In the message, Google informs developers that it is planning to “limit visibility” or remove completely apps that do not meet certain requirements. The primary target of Google’s quality control efforts are “zombie apps.” Typically, these are apps that are counterfeit versions of popular games or utilities that don’t perform the task they purport to do. The intention of the apps is to show up in search when people go looking for other common apps in hopes of garnering a few downloads—occasionally with malicious intentions once they land on a person’s phone. The area of emphasis for Google appears to be the privacy policy of these apps. In its letter to developers, Google notes that it requires developer “to provide a valid privacy policy when the app requests or handles sensitive user information.” Apps can request permission to just about every part of a user’s device, including access to the camera, microphone, account details and contacts among other details. Google also mandates apps maintain a transparent disclosure of how user data is handled. Related Stories New Look For The Google Play Store Leaked Google Allo Has Surpassed 5 Million Downloads On The Google Play Store In Google’s developer guidelines, it states, “if your app collects and transmits personal or sensitive user data unrelated to functionality described prominently in the app’s listing on Google Play or in the app interface, then prior to the collection and transmission, it must prominently highlight how the user data will be used and have the user provide affirmative consent for such use.” App developers have until March 15 clean up their apps and meet any necessary privacy policy requirements. Google warned that failure to do so would result in “administrative action will be taken to limit the visibility of your app, up to and including removal from the Play Store.” The Google Play Store has become something of a hotbed for phony apps over time. While Google has attempted to clean up the store on a regular basis, it has often had more problems than Apple’s App Store for iOS—which has run into its own problems. A major Android malware attack called Gooligan hit devices last year and managed to infect more than one million accounts according to security researchers. Some of the apps spreading the malicious software were found in the Google Play Store until Google removed them.

Name: Subject: Message: Sony’s Android TVs will be the first televisions with Google Assistant Newsby John Callaham10 hours ago 10 528 11 Earlier this year at CES 2017, Google announced that its Google Assistant voice command feature would find its way into smart TVs. Today, Sony confirmed that its upcoming 2017 lineup of Bravia 4K televisions, which already have Android TV installed, will be the first to incorporate Google Assistant. See also: Best Android TV devices January 3, 2017 That’s the good news. The bad news is that if you buy one of the new 2017 Sony Bravia televisions right away, you won’t get access to Google Assistant out of the box. Wired reports that it will be added, via a firmware update, sometime “later this year”. Once it is enabled, you can start using Google Assistant by pressing on a special button on your TV remote. If you also own a Google Home connected speaker, you can issue voice commands to your Sony Android TV through that method as well. Google Assistant will have a few specific additions for its use on Sony’s new TVs. For example, you can tell it to change your source inputs in case you want to switch from using your cable TV box to your Xbox One console. You can also launch apps on the TV like Netflix and Hulu with your voice, along with adjusting the volume. You can ask it to start playing a specific TV show, or simply to change the channel. All of this sounds great on the surface, but it’s too bad that we will have to wait an unknown amount of time before Sony updates its TVs with Google Assistant. It will also have to compete with a lineup of smart TVs due out this year that will have Amazon’s Fire OS, all of which will come with their own voice remote to issue commands to the company’s Alexa digital assistant. Would you want to wait until your next smart TV has voice command features to buy it? Let us know what you think in the comments!

Argo AI was founded by two top engineers from Google and Uber who were both previously at Carnegie Mellon’s robotics institute. The startup plans to use its expertise in AI to develop software for self-driving vehicles. Bryan Salesky, the CEO of Argo AI, was the head of hardware at Alphabet’s car division, Waymo, for the past three years. Peter Rander, Argo’s COO, left Uber in September, where he was one of the top engineers for its self-driving division. This is the largest investment a traditional auto manufacturer has made in self-driving technology. General Motors acquired self-driving startup Cruise for $1 billion last year, and Uber bought autonomous trucking company Otto for $680 million, also last year. Ford will dole out the $1 billion over a five year schedule but will immediately become the majority shareholder. The company declined to disclose its specific stake, but the investment would value Argo at over $1 billion. Ford says Argo will remain headquartered in Pittsburgh and operate with substantial independence. Both Ford and Argo elect two board seats, with a fifth independent position. Ford plans to install Raj Nair, head of research and development, and Vice President John Casea to the board. This is the most Ford has spent on autonomous technology. In 2016, the automaker acquired on-demand shuttle service Chariot for far below $1 billion and invested in Velodyne, a maker of Lidar technology. Ford says it plans to market fully self-driving cars by 2021. While Ford will effectively own Argo, the AI developer plans to eventually license its software and sensor suite to other companies. “Our view [is that], in the future, there will be a number of players that will have systems,” Ford CEO Mark Fields told Recode in an interview. “There won’t be just one winner. But at the same time we can offer that to other companies where it doesn’t compromise our competitive advantages. We think that’s a great opportunity to get even more scale and create some value for the companies.” “There’s a lot of advantages to having this company be independent and operate with the agility of a startup,” Salesky told Recode. “We know that in order for this technology to be fully realized and deployed at scale, we have to work with folks that know how to do that.” According to Fields and Rander, the most important reason Ford didn’t acquire Argo was so the startup could attract top talent with offers of equity. This is also not the first instance of a cross-pollination between staffers from Uber, Google and Carnegie Mellon. Both Rander and Salesky — who plan to have a team of 200 by the end of the year — were big losses for Alphabet’s self-driving car company Waymo and for Uber. As Recode first reported, Rander left Uber along with two other top self-driving engineers — mapping head Brett Browning and autonomy head Drew Bagnell — just a year or so after Uber famously raided Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute for top talent. Rander’s departure came in the wake of Uber’s acquistion of Otto, a startup co-founded by former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski. The Otto founder was put in charge of Uber’s entire self-driving division, which sources said contributed to staff defections. For Waymo, Argo is the latest car startup to be hatched by one of its former engineers. In addition to Argo and Otto, Chris Urmson, Waymo’s former lead technologist, is starting, Aurora, as Recode first reported. Then there’s Nuro.ai, which was started by two former top executives of Google’s self-driving car project: Jiajun Zhu and Dave Ferguson. Though Google has been working on its self-driving technology far longer than any other tech company and has arguably the most advanced technology, many sources say there has been internal tension over the company’s path to market. It’s no coincidence that many of those who’ve left what is now called Waymo to start their own companies are laser-focused on commercializing self-driving technology. “We want to take a straight line path to market as much as we possibly can,” Salesky said.

In order to bring its Level 4 autonomous ridesharing fleet to the market, the automaker announced today a $1 billion investment in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence and robotics startup. This move makes Ford the majority owner of the company, which is now tasked with building the robotic brain that will power Ford's fleet. Argo AI is based in Pittsburgh and was founded in 2016 by former leaders from Google and Uber, two companies working hard on their own autonomous vehicle programs. Bryan Salesky worked for years on Google's autonomous car project, while Peter Rander was in charge of Uber's self-driving efforts until late last year. Both were involved with the Carnegie Mellon National Robotics Engineering Center. Ford will be moving employees currently working internally on its virtual driver system over to Argo AI. In an investor and media briefing today, Ford CEO Mark Fields said that Argo AI will essentially be an independent subsidiary of the automaker. The deal would still allow Argo AI to license its virtual driver software to other manufacturers. Argo AI will in turn partner with Ford's other divisions on the autonomous vehicle project. By the end of the year, Argo AI expects to have 200 total employees. Although most every major automaker is working on some form of self-driving cars, Ford has been far more open and forthcoming with detail than many of its competitors. The company is making no secret of its shift in focus away from strictly designing and building traditional automobiles.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google brings Home Control to Pixel phones with Google Assistant By Rei Padla - February 10, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google has recently made an important update to the Pixel and Pixel XL. The two Google phones now have access to Smart Home control. You can connect to different smart devices from Nest, Philips Hue, WeMo, SmartThings, and Honeywell. Of course, you need to have the Google Assistant enabled, specifically the “Home Control” command. We all know the drill: say “OK Google” directly to your device and the phone will do whatever you ask it to do. When you say “OK Google”, you still need to choose the category whether it’s for the Pixel or Home Control. You can Add Rooms and Add Devices in the Home Control settings. You just need to log in your account for whatever brand or product you want to connect to. You can also customize a title for each room so be creative. It can be fun to hear and identify the names you give each room in your smart home. You can name it just about anything. Google will be rolling out the update in the coming days. Note that it’s ready for the Pixel and Pixel XL phones initially. Other devices that support Google Assistant will soon receive this enhancement so we’ll see.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Ford just invested $1 billion in self-driving cars by Matt McFarland   @mattmcfarland February 10, 2017: 3:16 PM ET Ford's vision for the future The race to build a self-driving car keeps getting more intense -- and expensive. Ford (F) announced Friday afternoon it would invest $1 billion over five years in a previously unheard of startup. Argo AI, led by Google and Uber veterans, will combine with Ford's existing team to develop a fully self-driving car. It's the latest high-priced investment that a major company has made in self-driving car engineers. Almost a year ago, General Motors (GM) spent $1 billion to acquire Cruise Automation. And last August, Uber spent $680 million on Otto, a self-driving car startup led by former Google (GOOGL, Tech30) engineers that hadn't even existed a year before. Related: You car's data may soon be more valuable than the car itself Argo AI is a startup that hadn't even been publicly announced. And Ford hasn't acquired all of the startup, it's only the majority stockholder. Argo AI engineers will have equity in the company, which should help it attract talent. Other companies have tried similar arrangements amid intense competition for qualified engineers. When Google spun off its self-driving car project as Waymo in December, CEO John Krafcik said the arrangement would help it to better align incentives for employees. Argo AI plans to have 200 employees by year's end. They will be split between Silicon Valley, Michigan and Pittsburgh. Argo AI CEO Bryan Salesky spent three years working at Google's self-driving car program. He left in 2016. His cofounder, Peter Rander, spent nearly two years working on Uber's autonomous vehicle team in Pittsburgh. Experts have long warned that legacy automakers such as Ford risk being disrupted by tech companies like Google. Tech companies have the software expertise that is necessary to build a safe self-driving car. The doomsday scenario for automakers is to turn into Nokia, which was a global leader in cell phones -- until Apple unveiled the iPhone. Nokia wasn't able to keep up during the smartphone revolution and watched as SiIlicon Valley titans Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and Google sucked up their profits. Ford is clearly willing to spend a lot of money to avoid such a fate.

They’re both now available to order through the Google Store, although the titanium version of the Sport already appears to have sold out. Best Buy is also currently selling the Watch Style, but seemingly not the Sport. We aren’t sure if they will in the future. The larger Sport costs $349 and is decked out with features, including support for LTE connections, NFC for Android Pay, GPS and a heart rate monitor for run tracking, and a speaker for phone calls. The sleeker Style costs $249 (or $279 for rose gold) and doesn’t have any of those listed features. Both, however, include the new version of Android Wear.

Advertisement Last year, Google released an Android 7.1 Developer Preview, a beta for Nexus devices. The beta showcased some of the update’s features and it let select Nexus users test the update’s performance ahead of the final release. The company promised an Android 7.1 release for Nexus devices in December and the company made good on that promise. More recently, the company’s released a new February Android 7.1.1 build that brings security patches and, according to some Nexus 5x users, frustrating problems. The February Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 build is a security update that delivers some important patches to the former flagship. It’s small but it’s an important release for the Nexus 5X and Google’s stable of Nexus phones and tablets. Advertisement This roundup takes a look at the current Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Nougat build, Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 problems plaguing users on the old and new Android 7.1.1 build, a look at what’s officially coming after the Android 7.1.1 Nougat update, and some tips that might help you. We’ll continue to update this with new information so check back for regular updates as we cruise through the month. February Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Update: Impressions   1 / 7 Google recently rolled out a February Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 update. It's much smaller than the original Android 7.1.1 build and it doesn't bring any new features to the device.  The security build is small but it could also have a positive or negative impact on your device's performance and that's why we're taking a close look at it today.  We've spent just about a day with the new Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 update and battery life appears to be holding up. We haven't noticed any weird battery drain on our model. Advertisement If you start experiencing issues with battery life, and you might, know that it sometimes takes battery life a couple of days to settle in. If problems persist, you'll need to take action.  Up to this point we haven't run into any problems with connectivity. We've tested the Nexus 5X and its new Android 7.1.1 Nougat build with several ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices. Our connections remain strong and fast. We haven't experienced any random reboots or lockups/freezes/crashes and we haven't seen any UI lag when navigating around the home screen, apps and folders. Animations and transitions are snappy and fluid. It's about the same as the January Android 7.1.1 build.  The February Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Nougat update is performing well on our device. We recommend it for most users, particularly those who value their security. If you're feeling leery, track down a second or third opinion before installing it on your device.    1 / 7 23 Responses 10/07/2016 dennphill Reply Had no issues with upgrading to Nougat on my Nexus 5X (Verizon) yesterday – 6 Oct. Anguish in first several pages not necessary in my experience. Phone and service and WiFi (etc.) all seem OK. 10/08/2016 DennisUSA Reply My fingerprint reader has suddenly stopped working. Don’t know if it is related, but this seems suspicious. Anyone have any ideas for me? 10/12/2016 Pratyaksha Reply My Nexus also got the same problem of fingerprint then I just factory data reset now it’s working fine 10/13/2016 HellOJones Reply Finger printer sometimes collide with other apps, try deleting recently installed apps and rebooting device. For me, mine started working as soon as I deleted certain apps. 10/13/2016 Elicon200 Reply I found that my battery was not lasting nearly as many hours as it used it. Noticed immediately; from average 13 hours to about 8. 01/15/2017 Abhishek Gour Reply Same issue on mine too. And it started pretty abruptly. Getting an air of around 2 hours now, which used to be 3- 3 1/2 hrs 10/15/2016 Mohammed Hussain Reply Hi friends this is Hussain Actually I’m using Nexus 5x 32gb last 2months, Mobile is fantastic performance but last time android nougat 7.0 upgrade in my device. Suddenly my play store apps download in WiFi network only not download in mobile data. Please rectify my issues. And battery also drain quickly compared to marshmallow… 10/18/2016 igybundy Reply Many of us got dead phones after the update, usually from 2015 models. So if it is out of warranty wait until google says something. It might have been a bad OTA during the release but some have posted from a couple of weeks ago when they decided to update. After the flash and reboot, the screen is blank and will not turn back on, for others it goes into a boot loop and can not be recovered except for a new motherboard. 11/16/2016 Brendon Reply This happened to mine. Phone bricked a fee weeks after upgrade never to come to life again. While on a call with Google I was transferred to LG who told me that they cover it under warranty for 18 months from date of manufacture. Mine is currently out for repair. 12/15/2016 Mac Reply This is happening A BUNCH!!!! Many 5x phones are turning into a paper weight… I was advised by my son, who is now using a back-up phone due to his 5x completely gone… AND is currently fighting with LG and Verizon because as soon as the update downloaded, it fried!!! 12/15/2016 Mac Reply Update to my last posting, LG and Verizon will reimburse for the loss of the phone (in my sons case) if the phone was purchased with a credit card. Apparently, if the phone was beyond its year of Warranty, the credit card purchase is a type of ‘Warranty’… But, this is what my son is telling me. He might have swallowed his pride on the loss, and simply upgraded a (14 month) old phone. I am finding it Pathetic that we are paying out $500 a year to be forced into a mandatory “upgrade” once a phone developer decides to render our working product USELESS. Maybe we should leave cars on the side of the road once the gas tank goes empty, and blame it on the dealerships!!!! 10/22/2016 Harshit Reply Have been experiencing lagging in my Nexus 5X after the update. The UI seems to get jammed. Also the camera loading takes a while 10/28/2016 Afshin Reply I have not received any OTA update for android 7 on my Nexus 5x! Is it normal? Another question! Does the android 7 causes Bootloop on Nexus 5x? 10/28/2016 Afshin Reply My Device runs Android 6.1! 11/14/2016 amir Reply @Afshin, I read about bootloop, but i just got my 5X today. I will open the box and post here about it. 11/16/2016 Sean Reply My battery life has been terrible with the first release of Nougat 7.0. I just updated to the latest update and the battery life boosted to double the amount. 75% showing 1 day and 5hrs of usage. 12/08/2016 Anonymous Reply So all the article here is doing is complaining about the 7.0 update but it doesn’t explain how to bypass it to update to 7.1? 12/15/2016 Steve Simms Reply Steve I just did the 7.1.1 upgrade on my Nexus 5x and it cycles through the start up look over and over. I have shut it down after trying the hard re-set numerous times. Does anyone have any ideas on a fix. Seeing I cant get the phone to open the home page before going through the start up mode again i’m not sure what to do next. HELP 01/06/2017 Scott Reply I still haven’t received the 7.1.1 OTA update for my 5X. I’m still on 7.0. Is this an issue with my phone or is Google still in the process of rolling it out? 01/08/2017 alanbecker.deviantart.com Reply Real instructive and wonderful anatomical structure of content , now that’s user friendly (: 01/11/2017 Matt Reply 7.1.1 has broken Bluetooth connectivity with many people with certain types of car head units.

According to some Galaxy Note Edge owners, it also brings battery life problems along with it. With that in mind, we want to take an in-depth look at how to potentially fix bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life before and after Android 5.0 Lollipop. In September, Samsung took the curtain down from around its Galaxy Note Edge. As expected, the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge debuted with all sorts of bells and whistles including a new design, an improved display, a solid camera, and Android 4.4.4 KitKat. At the time, Android 4.4.4 KitKat was the most current version of Google’s mobile operating system. Given the Galaxy Note Edge’s status as a flagship, it was no surprise that it was among the first Samsung Galaxy smartphones to get Google’s new mobile OS, Android 5.0 Lollipop. The Galaxy Note Edge Lollipop update started rolling earlier this year and it delivers some big time features to Galaxy Note Edge users. Some have already gotten a taste of the changes, others are still waiting for the update to start rolling out. While the Galaxy Note Edge Lollipop update brings some huge changes to the device, it also brings Android 5.0 Lollipop problems including the usual array of battery life issues. Complaints about bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life have started to pick up as the software’s moved out to more variants and more regions around the world including the United States. Battery life issues always seem to plague Galaxy users after a new Android update though most of the time it’s not the actual update that’s causing the problems. Apps and other services are usually the culprit. For the moment, these Galaxy Note Edge battery life problems appear to be somewhat isolated though we do expect them to grow as more updates roll out. How to Fix Bad Galaxy Note Edge Battery Life With that in mind, we want to try and fix bad Samsung Galaxy Note Edge battery life for you. This guide delivers help to get better battery life on Samsung’s current flagship. These fixes should work if you’re on Android 4.4 KitKat or if you’re on Android 5.0 Lollipop. We’ve geared this towards Android 5.0 Lollipop users but we know that plenty of people remain on the older version of Google’s software. Find Apps Eating Up Your Battery The first recommendation we always make to people suffering from bad battery life is to check out third-party applications before doing anything else. Some people listen, some don’t. If you want to fix your bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life, you’re going to want to keep an eye on your applications for potential problems. Third-party apps have a tendency to put a huge dent into the battery life on smartphones regardless of the software that’s running on board. If you use an application a lot, it’s going to drain your battery but there are also times where bugs or issues might cause an app to go rogue and start abnormally draining the device’s charge. The first thing you’ll want to do is head into your settings and start taking a look at the effect that Galaxy Note Edge applications are having on the device’s battery life. If you notice anything out of the ordinary, it’s time to dig in. If you think an app is draining more battery life than it should be, try reinstalling it to see if that corrects the issue. If the problem persists, try uninstalling it to see if that has a positive effect. If you can’t figure out which app might be causing trouble, you’ll want to boot the Galaxy Note Edge into Safe Mode in an effort to single out potential troublemakers. Booting the device into Safe Mode disables third-party apps and allows you to isolate apps that could be causing the problems. Here’s how to boot the Galaxy Note Edge into Safe Mode: Power down the device. Then, press & hold the Power button and volume down key. Once it boots up, you can let go of the power button but keep the volume key held down. When you have successfully entered into Safe Mode, you will notice the text ‘Safe Mode’ at the bottom left corner of the screen. Restart the Galaxy Note Edge If you start noticing weird battery drain and or your Galaxy Note Edge starts heating up, you should try performing a simple restart to see if that returns things to normal. Most of you know how to restart the Galaxy Note Edge but we’ll remind you anyway. Hold down the power button, confirm that you want to turn it off, and then hold the power button down to turn it back on. We recommend doing this a few times a month to flush your device’s cache. Disable Unnecessary Services If your apps aren’t the problem and a simple restart doesn’t work, it’s time to start fiddling with some settings and working on some of your daily habits. In our experience, disabling features when they aren’t in use tends to have a positive impact on overall battery life. We recommend shutting off Wi-Fi connectivity when you don’t need it, Bluetooth connectivity when you don’t need it, NFC when you don’t need it, GPS when you don’t need it, and cellular data when you don’t need it. You can turn all of those off from inside the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge’s settings and you can easily monitor them with a quick swipe down from the top of the device’s screen. One thing that we’ve noticed is that poor cellular coverage is often to blame for bad Android battery life. When your Galaxy Note Edge needs to search hard for a signal, it runs the battery down faster, so keep that in mind when you’re in spotty areas. You may need to turn on Airplane Mode when there isn’t a strong 4G or LTE signal in the area. Try Using a Black Wallpaper Switching to a black wallpaper could help deliver better Galaxy Note Edge battery life thanks to the way Samsung’s Super AMOLED displays consume power. The device does not come with a default black wallpaper but you can search online for one. There are tons of them out there. After you’ve downloaded one, go to Settings, Wallpaper, Home and Lock Screens, More Images, and then set your black Galaxy Note Edge wallpaper. It’s a quick fix but there’s a chance that it will help. Start Using Its Built-in Software Features The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge comes equipped with two software features that you should know about if you’re experiencing bad battery life or if you’re concerned about the potential for bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life. If you head into the device’s Settings, you’ll notice two features. One is called Power Saving mode. The other is called Ultra Power Saving Mode. These features allow you to block background data and turn on grayscale mode which can help to limit the amount of juice being sucked up. You can also slow down the processor, reduce screen performance, turn off the lights on the buttons, and turn off GPS to save battery life. We also recommend getting familiar with the the Galaxy Note Edge’s brightness slider. The Galaxy Note Edge’s powerful display can suck up battery life so you’ll want to monitor the brightness of the screen if you’re starting to notice bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life. If auto-brightness isn’t working out, try doing it manually. Replace the Stock Launcher You also might want to consider replacing the stock TouchWiz launcher on the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge with something new. Samsung’s TouchWiz launcher has been known to hinder performance and it can be replaced. There are tons of different launches to choose from though the Nova Launcher is one of Android’s most popular choices. Give that a try if these other simple fixes don’t work out. Downgrade to Android 4.4 KitKat If you’ve already moved to Android 5.0 Lollipop, and some of you have, note that you can return to Android 4.4 KitKat in the event that Android 5.0 isn’t to your liking. We recently put together a guide on how to accomplish this so that’s going to be a great starting point for those of you that want to drop back down to Android 4.4. Factory Reset the Galaxy Note Edge If you don’t want to downgrade to Android 4.4 KitKat and you can’t find any fixes for your battery problems, you can factory reset your Galaxy Note Edge. This will wipe all of your files so you’ll need to make a backup before going this route. To factory reset the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge, go into Settings, User & Backup, and select Backup and Reset. From there, select Factory Data Reset. From there, select Reset Device and then Delete All. If nothing works, contact your carrier or Samsung. If you’re under warranty, you might be able to finagle your way into getting another device, or at the very least, a replacement battery. 7 Responses 05/20/2015 Jim Carter Reply The Lollipop update was certainly responsible for my battery/overheating issues as evidenced by flawless KitKat performance followed by immediate post update issues. There were no app additions, subtractions or updates. Upon seeing such stark evidence, I did a factory reset and all was well once again. Smartphones are no different than Windows PCs when it comes to OS updates. A clean install versus one OS on top of another is always the best choice. 05/26/2016 Carl Reply Soon tired of the remedies for fixing battery drain after an update.. If it wasn’t a problem before the update why should I have to go through all this crap of uninstalling all these apps BLACK WALLPAPER WTF? I didn’t buy this phone to make all kinds of changes these are not fixes but down grades on an expensive phone, this is useless info. 09/26/2016 Adam Reply I agree with Carl ^^^ 10/09/2016 Sergey Reply Usless article, misleading title. 10/29/2016 Deneiro Reply My phone is one year old, still making payments , went to Verizon , they told me to go buy a new battery, 30.00 dollars later I’m still pissed off 01/03/2017 Douglas Edwards Reply My Note Edge reboots when I still have 68% battery. A full charge with light to medium use last about 5 hours. I am considering tossing this and getting an IPhone. 02/10/2017 Bea Reply Yup, as well, Im still paying for my phone and it randomly shuts off and continuously reboots itself until I connect it to a charger. The jacked up part about it is I call T-Mobile and they suggested buying a new 30$ battery. WTF man! AND, I cant even talk on the damn thing in my house; shotty connectivity and doesnt matter if its wifi or data. Im just done with T-Mobile and Samsung…I will have to find another device that actually works as expected. Oh and my bill is over 200$ a month for two phones.

(Mark Lennihan, AP) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press on February 10, 2017 at 3:56 PM, updated February 10, 2017 at 3:59 PM comments NEW YORK -- The Google Chromebook, a type of stripped-down laptop, isn't a practical mobile device for many people -- mostly because it basically turns into an expensive paperweight whenever it can't find a Wi-Fi connection. Yet Chromebooks have defied expectations and made major inroads in an unexpected environment -- U.S. schools. In retrospect, that shouldn't be too surprising. Chromebooks are cheap and easy to manage, making them popular with budget-constrained schools with limited tech-support staff. And Wi-Fi is now common enough in U.S. schools and homes to make an internet-dependent device practical for students. Google doesn't want to stop there. It's releasing new models in partnership with Samsung that are designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers. They have several tablet-like features, including a stylus, touch controls and a 360-degree hinge that allows you to turn the screen faceup. One starts selling Sunday for $449; a more powerful version comes out in April for $100 more. Google and its manufacturing partners are trying to shed the Chromebook's perception as underperforming budget devices. But even with premium models, expanding beyond U.S. schools won't be easy. Chromebooks get schooled For personal computers and tablets, Chromebook's share of the U.S. education market was 49 percent last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2013, according to IDC figures released this week. But education accounts for just 14 percent of the 110 million devices shipped in the U.S. last year -- and Chromebooks make up just 9 percent of that broader total. Their numbers are also low abroad, even in schools. The Chromebook's popularity in U.S. education is also largely limited to grades K-12, analysts say. Macs and Windows laptops are still dominant on college campuses. Rough start Chromebooks use a lightweight operating system designed to get people online faster, without having to wait around for the computer to start up. Much of the heavy lifting on Chromebooks gets done on Google's remote servers, so Chromebooks themselves don't need fast chips or lots of storage. Early on, though, that made Chromebooks seem cheap and underpowered, which "soured consumer expectations right off the bat," IDC analyst Linn Huang said. Online storage for photos and documents online was much less common in 2011 when Chromebooks launched, so their limited local storage was initially unappealing. And the few apps available for Chromebooks didn't work offline, at least at the time. Differing needs But what constrains consumers can actually be liberating in education. Most kids don't need laptops on the bus or other locations where they can't connect to Wi-Fi. And they don't miss business software like Microsoft Office; Google's online apps for documents and spreadsheets do just fine for homework. "What surprised us was how quickly it took off in education," said Kan Liu, who oversees Chromebooks at Google. Apple's iPad was hot at the time, but Google sold the Chromebook on convenience. They're easier for classrooms to share; just sign in with a Google account, and a student's apps and documents instantly appear. Teachers also have online tools to lock down what apps and sites students can use. And with models available for less than $200, schools can get a few Chromebooks for the price of an iPad or a rival laptop. "It allows us to put more devices in students' hands," said Aaron Slutsky, chief technology officer for McDowell County Schools in North Carolina. Far from universal But Chromebook's success story in schools is largely an American one, and it's likely to stay that way. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa notes that Chromebooks are useless in China because the device depends on Google services that aren't available there. And in emerging countries, where a budget laptop would be ideal, she said internet access isn't reliable enough. Even in the U.S., the iPad is better for many creative tasks such as recording and editing movies. Students studying engineering, robotics and graphics won't be able to use Chromebooks to run the kind of specialized software that's available for Macs and Windows laptops. "But that's not needed for 98 percent of our students," said Tracy Dabbs, coordinator of technology and innovation at the Burlington-Edison School District near Seattle. Many school districts limit Apple and Windows computers for the students who specifically need them, then provide Chromebooks for the rest. McDowell County, for instance, has 5,500 Chromebooks, 1,200 iPads -- and only 100 Macs and 200 Windows PCs. Rivals stage a comeback Last year, Apple gave iPads in schools some Chromebook-like features unavailable to the general public. That includes ways to let multiple people use a single tablet and management tools for tech-support staff. A new Classroom app lets teachers control what apps students run and track their progress. Apple also provides classroom tools for teachers and students. Free e-books offer teachers step-by-step guides on using iPad apps and curriculum suggestions for everyday subjects. A separate app lets kids learn programming using the same language developers use to build iPad apps. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced last month new online apps and management tools for schools, along with Windows PCs priced similarly to Chromebooks. Beyond schools Huang said some businesses are giving Chromebooks a second look, especially in retail, banking and other settings where people share computers. But in many offices, the lack of business software such as Office is a major hurdle. Google's alternative lacks many advanced capabilities found in Office, and habits are hard to change. Google is trying to make Chromebooks more palatable by letting them run Android apps designed for phones and tablets. It's testing this capability on a handful of Chromebook models, including the new ones from Samsung. That makes it possible to install Office, Adobe Photoshop and many apps on a Chromebook, though these tablet versions have limited features compared with versions for Macs or Windows laptops.

The massive investment will make Ford the majority stakeholder in Argo AI, but the automaker said the software company has been structured to operate with "substantial independence." Ford said its relationship with Argo AI will combine its existing autonomous vehicle development program with Argo AI's robotics and "startup speed" on artificial intelligence software. Ford Ford CEO Mark Fields poses with the autonomous Fusion at the company's research lab in Palo Alto, Calif. Argo AI founders CEO Bryan Salesky, and COO Peter Rander are alumni of Carnegie Mellon National Robotics Engineering Center and former leaders on the self-driving car teams of Google and Uber, respectively. Argo AI's team will include roboticists and engineers from inside and outside of Ford working to develop a new software platform for Ford's fully autonomous vehicle, expected in 2021. Ford said it could also license the software to other carmakers. The current team developing Ford’s virtual driver system – the machine-learning software that acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles – will be combined with the robotics talent and expertise of Argo AI. This innovative partnership will work to deliver the virtual driver system for Ford’s SAE level 4 self-driving vehicles. Ford will become a majority stakeholder in Argo, and John Casesa, Ford's group vice president of global strategy, and Raj Nair, the automaker's product chief and chief technical officer, will sit on Argo's five-person board. By the end of this year, Argo will have offices in southeastern Michigan and California, according to Ford, along with its Pittsburgh headquarters. It will employ more than 200 workers at those three sites combined. Ford Last year, Ford purchased Chariot, a San Francisco-based on-demand shuttle service, which also operates in Austin, Texas and is planning to expand to eight other cities.   Another subsidiary created last March, Ford Smart Mobility LLC, will take the lead on the commercialization of Ford's self-driving vehicles, which includes options for using autonomous vehicles to move goods and people, such as ride sharing, ride hailing or package delivery fleets. Ford Smart Mobility also purchased Chariot, a San Francisco-based on-demand shuttle service, which also operates in Austin, Texas and is planning to expand to eight other cities. "The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," Ford CEO Mark Fields said in a statement. "As Ford expands to be an auto and a mobility company, we believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term." Ford A Ford self-driving prototype being tested at the University of Michigan's Mcity prvoing grounds. Software is the key differentiator in the functionality of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles. The average vehicle today has about 50 computer processors that control everything from engine control units (ECUs) to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) such as parking assist and adaptive cruise control. ADAS and fully autonomous vehicle technology are the sweet spots for Silicon Valley software developers, whose code can tie together the myriad cameras and sensors needed for a car to drive itself. Ford has already made significant investments in autonomous driving technology, including opening an R&D center in the heart of Silicon Valley. Ford is only one in a long list of carmakers that have invested in the area. Since 2011, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan-Renault and Toyota have all opened R&D centers in Silicon Valley. IDG, Wall Street Journal, Carmaker data Automakers who've set up shop or invested in Silicon Valley software companies to develop self-driving car technology. General Motors opened its Advanced Technology Silicon Valley Office in Palo Alto to develop an HTML browser for its Cadillac CUE in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) system. Nissan is focused on developing autonomous vehicles at its Silicon Valley facility, while Honda's operations there are working on human-machine interface technology, big data, connected vehicles and cybersecurity. Not only are the companies opening up R&D facilities, they're also recruiting rock star security and system engineers from the mecca of computer development, Jon Allen, a principal at management and tech consulting service Booz Allen Hamilton, said in an earlier interview with Computerworld. Meanwhile, a former mid-level Apple engineer heads Ford's new Palo Alto R&D center, just down the street from electric-car maker Tesla Motors. General Motors GM opened its Advanced Technology Silicon Valley Office in Palo Alto to develop an HTML browser for its Cadillac CUE in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) system. "This isn't your grandfather's automotive company any more. The [car makers] are moving away from simply being hardware manufacturers to becoming software developers," Allen said. "Fundamentally, the auto industry cannot be seen as just automakers any more. They're mobile developers." "And, look at who Apple is hiring. They're hiring auto executives," Allen added. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Name: Subject: Message: Deal: New customers can get Google Play Music and YouTube Red free for 4 months Apps & Games Newsby John Callaham10 hours ago 4 244 16 If you have yet to try out Google Play Music and YouTube Red because you didn’t want to pay $9.99 a month, there’s some good news. Google has once again launched a promotion that lets new customers try out both services for free for four months. See also: Problems with Google Play Music and how to fix them 2 weeks ago This isn’t the first time Google has offered this extended demo period but it does give you a much longer time period to experience both of these subscription services without having to pay up $39.96 from your wallet. If you are not familiar with Google Play Music or YouTube Red, here’s the skinny on both. First, you can still access all of the free features of Google Play Music, such as listening to tunes, uploading up to 50,000 of your own songs and access to podcasts and radio stations. However, the paid subscription adds ad-free access to its library of 35 million songs. You can also download your favorite tunes so you can play them offline, which can be helpful if you are on a beach, out in the woods or anywhere else where a cellular or Wi-Fi connection is not available. The YouTube Red service may be even better. Signing up for that subscription ditches all those annoying video and banner ads from the video service, so you can check out your favorite channels like Android Authority in full. A subscription also come with background audio support, in case you just want to listen to a video while doing something else on your phone. You can also play videos while offline. Finally, YouTube Red offers access to original video content that’s only available on this service, such as movies, sitcoms and more. Keep in mind that you will still need to type in your debit or credit card info, as you will be charged $9.99 a month after the free four month demo ends. The good news is you can cancel well before then and still get your free demo time, so it’s almost a win-win.

Announced eight months ago, the YouTube mobile livestreaming was only available to a select few in the community. That, however, has since changed. YouTube has now opened up the service to YouTubers with at least 10K subscribers. Oh, but that’s not the kicker to this whole story. Eligible content creators will also have at their disposal “Super Chat.” Umm… so what is Super Chat? Well, it’s Google’s vision of the “premium” that viewers must pay to be noticed by other viewers or content creators. In other words, you have to pay anywhere from $1 to $500 to make yourself seen in chat. Google is taking a few pages out of Facebook’s social media playbook. Zuckerberg and company rolled some similar services in the past to help make celebrities and other influencers become…well… even more influential. The amount of money people are willing to spend (as a fan/viewer) to interact with the people they follow has shown tremendous potential. The real question, though, is: Are the new YouTube features REALLY going to change the monetizing landscape of its content creators? YouTube launched its own esports/gaming livestreaming platform awhile back… and let’s just say Twitch is still vastly superior in every aspect.

Zero One: Are You Ready for AI? Feb 10, 2017 Tom Kaneshige EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 More and more companies are seeing the AI light, and if predictions prove right, this could be the year AI goes mainstream. Related Media Google I/O: Google reportedly preparing its own chatbot platform Advertisement “If somebody like Google or Apple announced tomorrow that they had made [AI android] Ava, we would all be surprised, but we wouldn’t be that surprised.” –Alex Garland, writer-director of “Ex Machina” (2015) Imagine a smart robot performing delicate surgery under the control of a surgeon. Or an artificial intelligence (AI) machine mapping genomic sequences to identify the link to Alzheimer’s disease. Or psychiatrists applying AI in natural language processing systems on the voices of patients to assess their risk of suicide. You don’t have to imagine anymore, because all of this is happening right now. The great promise of AI – a technology once confined to sci-fi movies – lies within the grasp of everyday business. More and more companies are seeing the AI light, and if predictions prove right, this could be the year AI goes mainstream. “It’s an incredible time, and it’s very hard to forecast, what can these things do?” said Google co-founder Sergey Brin, speaking at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, last month. To be sure, line-of-business executives (LOBs), the new shot-callers for tech, care little about pie-in-the-sky ideas. But they’ll pay close attention to real-world business outcomes and may be wondering if AI is right for their businesses. It’s a simple answer: If not AI today, AI tomorrow. That’s because AI has the potential to impact nearly every aspect of business, from predicting customer needs to optimizing operations and supply chains. “AI can transform your business,” wrote Forrester analysts Martha Bennett and Mathew Guarini, in a research note. “AI will be employed across enterprises, doing everything from engaging with customers and employees to automating and improving large elements of the operation.” Related: Digital Business Transformation: A Channel Story It’s still early days for AI, but that’s about to change. A Forrester survey of business and tech professionals found only a small number of companies with AI implementations, yet more than half of companies said they plan to invest in AI in the next 12 months. Specifically, 37 percent plan to implement intelligent assistants for customers and 35 percent doing the same with cognitive products. Among AI adopters, 57 percent said improving the customer experience is the biggest benefit. Marketing and sales, product management, and customer support lead the AI charge. Forrester puts AI deployments into five buckets: speech recognition, such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana; machine learning, such as Netflix’s customer data-driven recommendations; image recognition; advanced discovery techniques, such as IBM Watson; and robotics and self-driving cars. AI makes the most sense in industries with big data, such as healthcare. After all, AI feeds off of data but in a slightly different way than simple analytics. Whereas analytics software mines data to unearth trends and make predictions about the future, AI systems use data as a kind of sharpening stone to refine algorithms that produce targeted outcomes, such as diagnosing a type of cancer. In a way, AI influences the future. “With AI, we can begin to advance our analytics capabilities to personalize the interventions we roll out to patients and move from looking in the rearview mirror at what worked historically to looking at what could work in the future with predictive and prescriptive analytics,” wrote Forrester analysts Kate McCarthy and Nasry Angel in a research note. Such awesome power has led to decades-worth of apocalyptic sci-fi movies and television shows, from “Blade Runner” (1982) to “Terminator” (1984) to “The Matrix” (1999) to “Battlestar Galactica” (2004-2009) to “Ex Machina” (2015) – all showing AI machines putting a beatdown on their human creators. Before waving this off as merely entertainment, LOBs should keep in mind the fear that people have about AI. For instance, AI’s ability to gauge the likelihood of an individual becoming sick or getting in a car accident opens up a host of societal issues. Armed with this knowledge, will insurance companies raise rates? Societal and privacy concerns are just a few of the many challenges facing AI adopters. As with any emerging technology on the verge of taking off, there’s a severe technical skills shortage. LOBs must make sure they have the right talent to pull off AI projects, such as engineers to select and prepare data for AI and developers to customize AI software to the use case and fine tune AI algorithms. It’s a Herculean task. Forrester says training IBM Watson for a new diagnostic domain takes between six and 18 months, depending on how complicated the domain and how much data available. Related: Rise of the IoT Architect Poor talent can make a mess of things, even more so with AI. Like in the sci-fi movies, AI is as flawed as its human creators. Forrester gives an example of a machine-learning system trained to predict a patient’s risk for catching pneumonia when admitted to the hospital. Developers of the AI system forgot to put in critical information in the data set. As a result, Forrester says, the AI system told doctors to send home patients with existing asthma conditions – a high-risk category. Human bias also raises its ugly head in AI systems. There have been reports of image-recognition AI automatically identifying a blinking person as Asian and AI systems designed to assist police discriminating against African Americans. Then there’s the infamous Tay, a Microsoft Twitter AI chatbot depicted as a pixelated young woman released in spring last year. After Twitter users tricked the chatbot into making outlandishly offensive remarks, Microsoft yanked Tay offline and apologized. “AI systems can behave unpredictably,” Forrester’s Bennett and Guarini said. “In particular when working on complex or advanced systems, developers often don’t know how AI-powered programs and neural nets come up with a particular set of results… It gets dangerous when the software is left to take decisions entirely unsupervised.” Despite its long history and inherent dangers, AI has come far in the last few years. Consider Google’s Brin, a computer scientist who admitted he didn’t pay much attention to AI in the 1990s because “everyone knew AI didn’t work.” Before becoming president of Google parent company Alphabet, Brin headed the Google X research group, which, in turn, worked on Google Brain, an AI project that began in 2011. Today, Google Brain is part of the tech giant’s DNA. “Fast-forward a few years, and now Brain probably touches every single one of our main projects, ranging from search to photos to ads to everything we do,” Brin said, adding, “We really don’t know the limits.” Tom Kaneshige writes the Zero One blog covering digital transformation, big data, AI, marketing tech and the Internet of Things for line-of-business executives.

Ford will investment the money in Argo AI, a start-up founded by former leaders from Google and Uber's self-driving car research units, and they will work toward the goal of a system that's ready for deployment in 2021. The research will be focused on a virtual driver system capable of operating at what's called "SAE level 4." It's one of five levels defined for self-driving cars and specifically describes an autonomous car that's capable of completely controlling the vehicle in almost any condition. After it has been engaged, drivers do not need to pay attention to the driving. It's a step more advanced that many of today's demonstration systems, which still require driver control in many situations, and one step down from full automation. Ford has already said that it's hoping to have a level-4 commercial vehicle ready for sale in 2021. Argo AI is based in Pittsburgh and was recently founded by Bryan Salesky, who headed hardware development at Waymo, Google's self-driving car unit, and Peter Rander, who was an engineer at Uber's autonomous car research project. Like other auto makers, Ford has already begun researching autonomous driving technology, but Friday's announcement, which also makes Ford majority shareholder in Argo AI, goes beyond the company's own cars. Ford said the technology could be licensed to other companies looking at autonomous technology. That's a departure from much of the driverless car research to date, which has been focused on the company's own vehicles. Argo AI will have about 200 employees working on the project once it gets up and going. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

On Thursday, Google officially announced that WebVR is coming to Chrome; this makes it easier to discover content spontaneously. It means you can now easily navigate to a specific webpage, click on a WebVR experience, and navigate it with your finger if that’s how you want it. You can also toss your phone into your Daydream View to have a more immersive experience. This is particularly very interesting when you consider that using VR on your phone used to be a deliberate experience. How does WebVR help content creators? WebVR helps creators and companies to dig into the world of creating VR experience without the need to host them in a native VR app, reports TechCrunch. Adding it to the Google Chrome browser will enable websites host 360-degree videos that people can view, and support complete experience with the Daydream headset and controller. “With the latest version of Chrome, we’re bringing VR to the web—making it as easy to step inside Air Force One as it is to access your favorite webpage,” said Megan Lindsay, Chrome’s product manager. This is probably the best time to get the Chrome browser on your Android phone update—and that’s if you already have a Daydream VR headset. The experience, according to Lindsay, is something you won’t want to miss out on. Credit: https://blog.google/products/chrome/experience-virtual-reality-web-chrome/ “You can already try out some great VR-enabled sites, with more coming soon. For example, explore the intersection of humans, nature and technology in the interactive documentary Bear 71. Questioning how we see the world through the lens of technology, this story blurs the lines between the wild world and the wired one.” Not to worry if you don’t have a headset; you can view VR content on any phone or desktop computer and interact using your finger or mouse. Google is planning on adding more VR-enabled sites in no distant future, you better watch out for that. The company also promised to bring virtual reality to everyone regardless of the kind of device they use: “We want to bring VR to everyone on any device, and in the coming months we’ll add support for more headsets, including Google Cardboard. Try out these VR-enabled sites to be one of the first to experience the magic of VR on the web.” Google’s adventure into VR began in 2015 when reports surfaced online that the company was working on a virtual reality version of Android. This, according to the WSJ, would be a software platform that could be available to anyone to build virtual reality apps. Google, according to the report had “tens of engineers” working on developing a version of Android that will power VR apps. Competition seems to be brewing among major players as Sony, Facebook, and Microsoft already are already taking the market by storm. Everyone seems to be securing a place in the market, which makes it easier to understand what Google is planning to do.

Taxpayers should hope the rumors are true. While internet service providers (ISPs) have invested more than $1.5 trillion in private funds in building broadband infrastructure over the last two decades, Google Fiber has built its small network on taxpayer subsidies and special interest favors. The two most egregious examples of this behavior are in Provo, Utah and Huntsville, Ala. About a decade ago, taxpayers in Provo paid nearly $40 million for a high-speed Internet network, iProvo, that allowed the city to sell internet access directly to customers in competition with private providers. The city borrowed heavily for construction. To help pay back the loans, the city charged residents exorbitant fees of up to $700 to install the service and raised taxes on utility bills. Not surprisingly, residents were outraged and iProvo floundered. ADVERTISEMENT The city finally decided to cut its losses and looked for a buyer to take over its network. Google Fiber was waiting in the wings and, boy, did the company make off like bandits. The company bought iProvo for just one dollar. One dollar. That is .000000025 percent of what Provo’s taxpayer-subsidized expenditure. Huntsville’s misadventure is ongoing. That city is using public money to build a network for Google Fiber to lease. The system reportedly will cost $57 million. Alphabet is one of the largest companies in the world. It does not need to pick Huntsville taxpayers’ pockets to achieve its fiber dreams. Kansas City also opened its wallet to Google Fiber. In their quest for Kansas City to become the first Google Fiber, city leaders plied Google Fiber with all sorts of free stuff. As one reporter pointed out, Google Fiber’s contract says the city will “make space available to Google in City facilities for the installation of Google’s Central Office equipment and for additional network facilities” and “will not charge Google for such space, power, or related services.” Free rent and free utilities. That sounds appealing to a lot of Kansas City residents and small businesses in the area, but only wealthy mega companies need apply. Google Fiber has negotiated sweetheart deals with other cities for leases on the “fiber huts” needed for its networks. These huts essentially are relay stations that allow Google Fiber to move its fiber signal to homes and businesses on the last mile of its network. In San Antonio, Texas city officials provided a sweetheart lease to Google Fiber to use several city parks for its huts.  The lease was made at below market rates and residents weren’t given the opportunity to discuss the deal in public hearings. (According to one estimate, Google Fiber is paying $0.29 per square foot for its leases when the going rate is around $5.) Some of the sites are in historic or residential neighborhoods and on valuable park land where other commercial interests and property owners are not allowed to build. The city now has halted construction because neighbors are outraged. A local television station also recently reported that Google Fiber’s subcontractors haven’t paid for damages done to some homes during the construction process. Google Fiber also is building fiber huts in Charlotte, N.C., where it recently was granted 82 construction permits and in Raleigh, N.C., Atlanta, Ga., and Nashville, Tenn. In Charlotte, the company is reportedly paying $2 per square foot for its lease. Residents there already are upset about disruptions and damage attributed to construction and there also is concern that Google Fiber is building in wealthier neighborhoods first, a prospect that, if true, could expand the city’s digital divide. Alphabet’s pockets are deeper than those of the taxpayers’ of these cities. These handouts amount to nothing more than backdoor corporate welfare. Citizens are forking over too much and getting too little in return. Google Fiber is sinking and now it’s time for taxpayers to abandon ship.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile ZTE Axon 7 Becomes Cheapest Phone With Google’s Daydream VR Support, Thanks To Nougat Update By Zara Ali Feb 7, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Joining the Nougat update bandwagon, ZTE has finally announced the Android 7.0 OTA update for the Axon 7 smartphone. At the CES this year, the company promised that Nougat update for the ZTE Axon 7 would come in January, but it missed the deadline by a week. With the Nougat update, the ZTE Axon 7 gets a slew of new features. Other than the regular Nougat features, there also many surprise elements that will be of some use. For starters, the update brings enhanced battery saving “Doze” support along with the multi-window support that allows the usage of two apps simultaneously in two windows side by side. In addition, the update also brings new emojis onboard. The company has worked closely with Google to get support for Daydream VR platform, and with this collaboration, the Axon 7 is the first ZTE smartphone with such compatibility. Not only this, Axon 7 is now the cheapest smartphone in the United States to get DayDream support, which will now let users Google’s Daydream VR headset for excellent VR experience. Advertisement Not just Google, ZTE has also allied with Hiya to enhance caller ID support on the phone. It will help users in identifying calls and also block the unwanted calls. Hiya has previously partnered with leading manufacturers such as Samsung and Huawei to provide caller ID assistance on their phones in other regions outside the US. But ZTE is bringing the same feature for Axon 7 units in the US. Commenting on the update, ZTE USA’s VP of Technology Planning and Partnerships, Jeff Yee, says: “We’re excited to team up with Hiya to automatically protect our consumers from the nuisance of robocalls. Our Axon 7 is the first in the US to offer spam and scam protection along with a natively integrated caller ID solution for free because we are committed to protecting our consumers and giving them the best phone experience possible.” To recall, the ZTE Axon 7 was marketed as the “most affordable flagships” of 2016. It comes with flagship-level specifications and does not cost a bomb. The phone is available at $400 price tag. Now that ZTE has finally taken the route to Nougat, we can expect its other devices to follow suit soon. The update for the Axon 7 will start rolling from today and will hit all the units in the coming days. ZTE has not revealed whether Axon 7 Mini will also be updated to Nougat, but we can expect the phone to get it soon. You can check if your ZTE Axon 7 phone has got the update by going to Settings>About Phone>Check for update. The version number for the latest update is A2017UV1.1.0B15.

LG Watch Sport Designed to Take Advantage of Android Wear 2.0 The LG Watch Sport is one of the first smartwatches to support Android Wear 2.0, which was released on Feb. 8. Google says it collaborated with LG on the Watch Sport's design, which features LTE as well as WiFi connectivity. It Runs the Newly Released Android Wear 2.0 Arguably the biggest feature in the LG Watch Sport is its operating system. Android Wear 2.0 was unveiled at Google I/O in May but didn’t find its way to devices until now. It comes with a built-in app marketplace, an always-on watch face and a customizable home screen. The Watch Features a Round, High-Quality Display The LG Watch Sport comes with a round display measuring 1.4 inches. According to LG, the display has a resolution of 480-by-480 and 348 pixels per inch, which puts it among the best in the smartwatch market. LTE Connectivity Is Built in The smartwatch comes with both WiFi and LTE connectivity, allowing users to be productive on the go. The feature will enable users to download apps directly to their devices wherever they might be; absent LTE support, that wouldn’t be possible. Android Pay Support Speeds Checkout The LG Watch Sport comes with a near-field communications chip, making it possible to complete mobile payments from the smartwatch via Google’s Android Pay. Users can hold the device up to a payment terminal and send payments wirelessly. Go Streaming with LG LG’s smartwatch fully supports Google’s mobile apps, including Google Play Music. It supports music streaming and lets users sync playlists directly from the watch or stream them over the internet to Google Play Music. It’s Also a Fitness Tracker Thanks to an expanded Google Fit app, the LG Watch Sport comes with multiple fitness-tracking features. Users will be able to see how far they’ve traveled, track their steps and calories and more. The smartwatch also will recommend ways to improve a workout. Wireless Charging Support a Convenient Feature The LG Watch Sport supports wireless charging. The smartwatch ships with a charging base that charges the battery when the watch is placed on it. Users can interact with the device’s software while it’s charging. Protection Against Damage LG isn’t skimping on protective features in the Watch Sport. The device has a rating of IP68, meaning it’s both water- and dust-resistant. According to LG, the smartwatch can be immersed in nearly 5 feet of water for 30 minutes with no damage. The Watch Supports Android and iOS Devices The LG Watch Sport can exchange data with Android or Apple iOS smartphones. Users need either a handset running Android 4.3 or newer or an Apple iPhone running iOS 9 or newer. Pricing and Availability The LG Watch Sport is slated to be available Feb. 10. The device will be available in AT&T and Verizon stores, as well as the Google Store and will retail for $349.

Twitter Facebook Ford to pump $1B into AI for driverless cars Former Google and Uber engineers will work with Ford on a system for 2021 Martyn Williams (IDG News Service) 11 February, 2017 07:17 - - - - print email Comments Ford plans to spend US$1 billion over the next five years on the development of an artificial intelligence system for driverless cars. Ford will investment the money in Argo AI, a start-up founded by former leaders from Google and Uber's self-driving car research units, and they will work toward the goal of a system that's ready for deployment in 2021. The research will be focused on a virtual driver system capable of operating at what's called "SAE level 4." It's one of five levels defined for self-driving cars and specifically describes an autonomous car that's capable of completely controlling the vehicle in almost any condition. After it has been engaged, drivers do not need to pay attention to the driving. It's a step more advanced that many of today's demonstration systems, which still require driver control in many situations, and one step down from full automation. Ford has already said that it's hoping to have a level-4 commercial vehicle ready for sale in 2021. Argo AI is based in Pittsburgh and was recently founded by Bryan Salesky, who headed hardware development at Waymo, Google's self-driving car unit, and Peter Rander, who was an engineer at Uber's autonomous car research project. Like other auto makers, Ford has already begun researching autonomous driving technology, but Friday's announcement, which also makes Ford majority shareholder in Argo AI, goes beyond the company's own cars. Ford said the technology could be licensed to other companies looking at autonomous technology. That's a departure from much of the driverless car research to date, which has been focused on the company's own vehicles. Argo AI will have about 200 employees working on the project once it gets up and going. Demand for 3rd Party ERP Support Soars More from Rimini Street Join the Computerworld newsletter!

YouTube Go was targeted at India, which has been eyed as a growth market for Google. Now, it’s been reported that a beta version of YouTube Go for early testers has been made available for download. The app is essentially a faster and lighter version of YouTube. It gives you the option to stream selected videos immediately or to download them for offline viewing in standard and low-quality definition which is an extra option from the standard offline viewing feature. YouTube Go also allows you to send videos to other YouTube Go users that are near you via a local Wi-Fi hotspot and this won’t eat up your data. The app isn’t available for download on Google Play for Zimbabwe yet, but there is an option to install it via an apk which you can get by following the link below. advertisement YouTube Go beta version apk download Considering how videos are an increasing representation of how we consume content on the internet, workarounds to data challenges like YouTube Go are a big deal. Since African internet use faces similar challenges the hope is that companies like YouTube also make an extension for African users in the same way that Facebook has made lighter access to its platform a use case for the African market. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Android Apps, Google, Internet videos, YouTube, YouTube Go, YouTube Offline Previous Post « EcoCash reduces its MasterCard transaction limit to US$400 per month Next post One Comment ManFidza says: February 10, 2017 at 9:20 PM thanks I tested it.It sure does save data but at the expense of video quality.Good for watching Zim comedies on Youtube Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

For example, if you have a Pixel C tablet with no data, plus a Pixel with active data, you can establish a data connection to the Pixel C in just moments. As Amarilio describes, “When you unlock a tablet such as the Pixel C, it will notice if there is no internet connection available, and will ask your Pixel phone if it has internet and battery life. If it does, we will give you an option to enable a secure hotspot and pair automagically, without even taking your phone out of your pocket.” Listed on Google’s support page for Instant Tethering, the Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 6P running Android 7.1.1 and up can run as “host” devices. A receiving device will need to be a Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel C, or Nexus 9 running Android 6.0 and up. Of much importance, Google highlights that certain carriers have their own limitations when it comes to tethering. Some cellular carriers limit or charge extra for tethering. We recommend checking with your carrier. If your cell plan is green lighted for all sorts of tethering, and you have the required hardware with the latest Android build (and we know that’s not many of you), enjoy it. To find it, head to: Settings, Google, Instant Tethering.   Via: Google [2] Post navigation Previous StoryT-Mobile Tuesdays Bringing Back Free Pizza, This Time With Papa John’s Next StorySprint Announces 5 Unlimited Lines for $90 Promo Plan That Only Lasts a Year fritzo2162 I don’t get it- if I turn my hotspot on with one button, my other device connects automatically. Is this allowing you to turn the hotspot on your phone on FROM the tablet? JC I might be wrong, but I believe the whole point of this is so you don’t have to use hotspot through the carrier. I believe they are implying, that you are able to teether for free from device to device with Bluetooth thanks to Google. If you are using hotspot through you phone carrier, they charge for that service and data. Like I said, I might be wrong, but that’s my first take on reading this.. and I’m hope I’m right, because this would be step in the right direction. Tyler Shortt Anybody notice that when this tethering gets triggered (in my case on a pixel xl and a pixel c) and it’s rejected, the Bluetooth gets disabled? QLR I see… I had a Tracfone SIM in my phone and the option doesn’t show up on my 6P; I placed my Verizon UDP SIM in it and the option shows up. Yay. Too bad I have no other device to test it with. Rich Robinson I don’t have this option in my Pixel XL… sn2hotty It may take a while to get it. Android Central says it comes with an update to Google Play Services. Maybe you didn’t get the update yet. jonzey231 Saw AP write about it a while back but I didn’t actually see it on mine until a couple days ago when I flashed the new image on my 6P. Cory S Windows 10 has had something like this for windows phones for a while. I have really been wanting an android compatible version of it. I have been using tasker to do this with other android devices for sometime…but to have a laptop do the same is a lot more complicated. needa It would be nice if the gov’t would step in and make it law that these carriers have to allow us to get our data however we choose. Whether it be on this tiny screen that strains my eyes after an hour of use, or a laptop that is tethered to my phone. espnman36 Then the new pro-business Administration will never make such a law. needa Probably not. Just as the last administration didn’t. Cowboydroid It would be nice if a company would step up and provide the service as a key differentiator to their product, and thereby steal market share from the lousy companies that don’t offer it. needa Maybe we will see it with 5g. Probably not, but I can hope. Joel Hardman Question. I’m signed up for Android Beta on my pixel, so I’m on 7.1.2, but I’m still on January’s security update. Can I have both, or do I have to wait till 7.1.2 stable to get the February security update? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman The security update is of the overall OS, so you can’t have both separately. 7.1.2’s next beta release will likely include all the February security updates. cadtek91 Aw no Nexus 5 🙁 Good_Ole_Pinocchio How does that Instant Apps setting work? Allen George Going to have to put that build.prop hack back in so I can tether. UDP on Verizon and they can eat it for trying to charge me to use my data. Mike Levy This isn’t going to help bypass that. I guess you missed the part in the article where it mentions that some cellular carriers will limit or charge extra for tethering. You’d fall into the “charge extra” category. Allen George It has worked forever on Verizon. I don’t have the feature showing up on my Pixel, but the build.prop hack is working on 7.1.2. I just added it. espnman36 The edit to the build. Prop should work, theoretically. It bypasses the carrier provisioning so when you activate this particular method of tethering it’s not going to do a carrier check. Again this is theoretical espnman36 I’ve been using the build. Prop hack for a while. Hopefully that still works for this new setting. It bypasses the carrier provisioning so it should work, theoretically trixnkix637 I have hot spot/tethering added on my unlimited plan. It’s only $24 a month too. Might want to look into it. teh Jax If only there was a decent Chromebook or tablet that didn’t cost $500 that worked with this. Got 13GB/mo of tethering with my plan so this would be awesome!

Takes Another Shot at Amazon With Home Control InvestorPlace Brad Moon 18 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Where the Obamas are headed after the White House 15 celebrities who had epic fails as entrepreneurs © Provided by InvestorPlace Alphabet Inc. Pixel Phone Gets a "New" Feature: Home Control Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home connected speaker takes on Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa on its home turf. But what about Google’s big advantage over Amazon in the smart home war — all those smartphones? The company has just begun rolling out Home Control, a new feature that lets Google Assistant control smart home devices by voice. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 827.46 +6.10 +0.74% Alphabet Inc GOOGL ▲ 834.85 +4.79 +0.58% However, at this point, Home Control — like Google Assistant — remains a feature that’s exclusive to Google’s own Pixel Phones. The Battle for the Smart Home Google Home is a connected speaker with Google Assistant baked in. Owners can use Google Assistant on the speaker to answer questions, find music and control a growing number of smart home devices using their voice only. The device is GOOGL’s answer to the Amazon Echo. Amazon’s Alexa-enabled speaker has been a surprise hit and allowed Amazon to take a big lead in the race to become the smart home hub — despite the distinct disadvantage of lacking a smartphone platform to host its digital assistant. Google has Google Now and the new Google Assistant, while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has Siri. Between them, the two companies have billions of mobile devices in consumers’ hands, yet Amazon still managed to leapfrog them with its personal assistant hosted in a speaker, to build an impressive smart home lead. Apple’s Siri can control HomeKit-compatible smart home devices using voice commands, and now GOOGL is rolling out a similar feature for its Google Assistant, Home Control. Home control Google’s new feature for voice control of smart devices isn’t actually new. Anyone who owns both a Pixel Phone and a Google Home speaker already had a Home Control setting on their smartphone. 10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today However, as of yesterday, GOOGL has begun to roll out Home Control to all Google Assistant users. This amounts to all Pixel Phone owners, since Google Assistant remains an exclusive that third-party Android smartphones don’t get. With Home Control, someone with a Pixel Phone gets the same voice control ability for smart devices they would have if they owned a Google Home speaker. They can use voice commands on their phone to change the temperature on their Nest Learning Thermostat or turn off the smart lighting in the room they just left. The battle for the smart home enters a new phase (sort of) At the start of this fight to be the company that becomes the hub of the smart home — the one who controls all those smart devices — the smartphone was it. Smartphones ran all the apps that controlled each of the devices and everyone owned one. With smartphones, the battle came down to iOS and Android, Apple and Google. Then Amazon disrupted everything with the Echo and Alexa. With thousands of compatible products and services, consumers have been snapping them up. Amazon sold out of the Echo at Christmas, after selling nine times more of the smart speaker than the previous year. Voice control is in. Having to poke buttons on a smartphone is out. Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0 However, Apple and Google are not about to cede the smart home to Amazon. GOOGL began its assault on Amazon with the Google Home smart speaker to directly take on the Echo and Alexa. With Home Control, it’s bringing voice control of smart devices to the smartphone, leveraging its massive lead over Amazon when it comes to numbers. There may be millions of Alexa-powered homes, but there are billions of people already carrying an Android smartphone. Except, most of those people still won’t be able to use Home Control. GOOGL has baked Home Control into Google Assistant, a feature that’s been exclusive to its Pixel Phones since they were released last fall. With Google Home and now Home Control, Alphabet clearly has Amazon’s number. The question will be whether Amazon gets Alexa into more third-party devices before Google decides to let third-party Android smartphone makers have access to Google Assistant. For GOOGL, the decision comes down to which is more valuable: maintaining a key competitive advantage for its own Pixel Phones, or giving up that Google Assistant and Home Control exclusivity to take a real shot at unseating Amazon in the smart home.

[Photo: courtesy of Ford Motor Company] More from Robot Revolution AI For Matching Images With Spoken Word Gets A Boost From MIT Why Google, Ideo, And IBM Are Betting On AI To Make Us Better Storytellers Wearables That Detect Emotion Could Tell You When The Conversation Is Getting Awkward Emily Price 02.10.17 3:30 PM Ford is going all in on self-driving tech. The automaker said today it plans to invest $1 billion over the next five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company founded by former Google and Uber employees to develop autonomous driving technology. "We think automation is going to define the automobile in the next decade, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford’s moving assembly line did 100 years ago," Mark Fields, Ford's president and chief executive, said at a press event in San Francisco announcing the partnership. Argo AI will work exclusively with Ford on building a virtual driver system, with the goal of Ford delivering an autonomous vehicle in 2021. While everything Argo AI works on during that time will be made available exclusively to Ford, over time there’s the potential for Argo AI to also license that technology to other automakers. Pictured left to right: Peter Rander (Argo AI COO), Bryan Salesky (Argo CEO), Mark Fields (Ford CEO), and Raj Nair (ford exec VP Global Product Development and CTO). With the investment, Ford will become the majority stakeholder in Argo AI. The company has been structured to operate with a good amount of independence. "From an accounting standpoint, Argo AI is a subsidiary of Ford," says Fields; however, he stopped short of calling the partnership an outright acquisition. Employees will all have equity in Argo AI, not Ford as a whole, which means that equity will change in valuation based on the success of just that business. Argo AI was founded in late 2016 by former Google and Uber employees in Pittsburgh. In stealth until today, the company is now actively recruiting for its engineering hubs in southeastern Michigan and the Bay Area, with the goal of having 200 employees by the end of the year. "We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide rage of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move," says Bryan Salesky, cofounder and CEO of Argo AI. "We are energized by Ford’s commitment and vision for the future of mobility, and we believe this partnership will enable self-driving cars to be commercialized and deployed at scale." He says the company understood early on that it would need to partner with a larger entity. With Ford, it will be able to move with the speed of a startup, but also have the funds and strength of a larger company, something that it will be able to use not only for R&D but also to help retain top talent. With the partnership, a number of Ford employees will also become Argo AI employees. Never miss a story.

Ford announced Friday afternoon it would invest $1 billion over five years in a previously unheard of startup. Argo AI, led by Google and Uber veterans, will combine with Ford's existing team to develop a fully self-driving car. It's the latest high-priced investment that a major company has made in self-driving car engineers. Almost a year ago, General Motors spent $1 billion to acquire Cruise Automation. And last August, Uber spent $680 million on Otto, a self-driving car startup led by former Google engineers that hadn't even existed a year before. Argo AI is a startup that hadn't even been publicly announced. And Ford hasn't acquired all of the startup, it's only the majority stockholder. Argo AI engineers will have equity in the company, which should help it attract talent. It plans to have 200 employees by year's end. Argo AI CEO Bryan Salesky spent three years working at Google's self-driving car program. He left in 2016. His cofounder, Salesky Rander, spent nearly two years working on Uber's autonomous vehicle team in Pittsburgh. Experts have long warned that legacy automakers such as Ford risk being disrupted by tech companies like Google. Tech companies have the software expertise that is necessary to build a safe self-driving car. The doomsday scenario for automakers is to turn into Nokia, which was a global leader in cell phones -- until Apple unveiled the iPhone. Nokia wasn't able to keep up during the smartphone revolution and watched as SiIlicon Valley titans Apple and Google sucked up their profits. Ford is clearly willing to spend a lot of money to avoid such a fate. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

If you’re not paying attention 24/7, it’s easy to miss some of the best stuff. Each week we will highlight five of the best new or overlooked apps and games. You’re sure to find some hidden gems in these recommendations. Go forth and download! 1. Custom Search Bar Widget One of the staples of an Android home screen is the ubiquitous Google Search Bar. The design of the search bar has changed over the years, but you don’t have to use the design that Google chooses. Custom Search Bar Widget allows you to completely customize the look and functionality of the search bar. It can be much more than a simple white bar that leads to Google. DOWNLOAD: Custom Search Bar Widget – Google Play Price: Free In-app Purchases: Yes Rating: 3.7/5 Installs: 50,000 – 100,000 2. Nuzzel Nuzzel has been around for a while, but more people should know about it. The app uses your Twitter account to curate the news. You see stories that your friends have shared, but it’s ordered by how many friends shared a story. A popular story that a lot of your friends are tweeting about will be at the top. You can even get notifications when multiple friends are tweeting about something. DOWNLOAD: Nuzzle – Google Play Price: Free In-app Purchases: No Rating: 4.4/5 Installs: 50,000 – 100,000 3.

Any Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, or Nexus 6P running Android 7.1.1 and above can be a “host” and share its internet connection automatically with another supported device signed into the same Google account. “When you unlock a tablet such as the Pixel C, it will notice if there is no internet connection available, and will ask your Pixel phone if it has internet and battery life,” Google’s Omri Amarilio wrote in a forum post explaining the feature. “If it does, we will give you an option to enable a secure hotspot and pair automagically, without even taking your phone out of your pocket.” Instant Tethering was first spotted in early testing late last month. You don’t have to enter any passwords or manually switch on the feature; it’s one of those just works things that could prove very convenient for anyone with multiple Android gadgets — so long as they’re of the Nexus or Pixel variety. Android pays very close attention to battery life during all this, according to Amarilio. If you’re finished with the tablet but forget to disconnect the Instant Tethering link, “we will notice that you stopped using your tablet and we will disconnect the hotspot for you to save your precious battery throughout the day.” This happens after about 10 minutes of inactivity. Apple already offers a similarly effortless tethering function between iOS hardware and Macs. Android tablets are a first step, but if Google can make this feature work with Chromebooks, it would help ensure that the cloud-connected laptops never get stuck without data so long as your smartphone is nearby.

 Ford just invested $1 billion in a secretive AI startup founded by former Google and Uber execs Danielle Muoio and Matthew DeBord Feb. 10, 2017, 2:51 PM 6,693 facebook linkedin twitter email print Screenshot via YouTube Ford is investing $1 billion in a secretive artificial intelligence startup headed by former Google and Uber execs to advance its self-driving car efforts. The startup, Argo AI, was founded by Bryan Salesky, the former director of hardware for Google's self-driving-car efforts, and Peter Rander, Uber's engineering lead at its autonomous cars center. Argo AI is based in Pittsburgh, Penn. and has hubs in Southeastern Michigan, where Ford is based, and the Bay Area of California. The $1 billion investment will be spread out over five years as Ford looks to commercialize its self-driving technology by 2021. According to Ford Chief Technical Officer Raj Nair, $1 billion is what it costs to develop advanced autonomous technology, and the investment is consistent with what Ford said its capital allocation in the space would be when it presented information to investors last year.  He told Business Insider, however that "the investment to deliver the entire autonomous vehicle" as planned in 2021 is more than that. Argo AI will leverage roboticists and engineers from inside and outside of Ford to develop a virtual-driver system for the autonomous vehicles in 2021, Ford said in a press release. The virtual driver system will use machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that improves with experience, to act as the brain of Ford's self-driving cars. The technology will deliver near-full-autonomy — a "level 4" capability — that can be used in very large geo-fenced urban areas. The Argo AI founder and Ford executives characterized the eventual application as an order of magnitude more sophisticated as the semi-self-driving systems currently on the road. Ford is a majority stakeholder in Argo AI, but the startup wrote in a Medium post that it's structured to operate with independence. Salesky and Rander will serve in the board, as will Nair and John Casesa, Ford's VP for Global Strategy. Some Ford employees will become Argo AI employees as a result of the investment. Employees will receive "significant equity participation" in Argo AI. On a conference call with Wall Street analysts and the media, Ford CEO Mark Fields said that Ford and Argo AI could take on additional investors in the future, or consider an IPO of the company. Fields also said that the five-year cadence of the $1-billion investment wouldn't be revealed, but he added that there would spending above and beyond that figure for future costs. Argo AI expects to have 200 employees in total by the end of the year. Ford acquired shuttle-bus service Chariot last year.Ford Long term, the investment could expand Ford's lines of business. "Our initial focus will be to support Ford’s autonomous vehicle development and production, but in the future, we may license our technology to other companies and sectors looking for self-driving capability," Ford's Medium post reads. Fields stressed the value of this licensing proposition is response to analysts' questions. The carmakers efforts around mobility services could yield returns in the 20% ballpark, Fields has said, compare with the 10% margins that a carmaker earns when business is good. The investment takes place against the backdrop of the traditional auto industry, flush with cash after several record sales years, looking to play a major role in the transformation of mobility. General Motors has invested $500 million in ride-hailing service Lyft and spent nearly $1 billion acquire Cruise Automation, a self-driving startup. Ford recently bought Chariot, a shuttle-bus service based in the Bay Area. The stakes are high. Ford is facing increasing pressure from Waymo, the self-driving-car company operating under Google's parent company Alphabet, and Uber. A Waymo Pacifica.Waymo Fiat Chrysler has supplied Waymo with 100 Pacifica minivans equipped with Waymo's self-driving-car hardware as part of the two companies' partnership. The minivans are currently being tested on public roads in Arizona and California. There are reports that Fiat Chrysler and Waymo could launch a self-driving taxi service by the end of 2017. Waymo's self-driving-car software is considered among the most sophisticated out there. Waymo's cars have driven over 2 million miles, amounting to 300 years of human driving experience. Uber has launched pilot programs for its self-driving cars in Pittsburgh and Arizona. The ride-hailing service is also partnering with Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz. Daimler will supply its self-driving cars to run on Uber's network. Ford was careful to characterize its investment in Argo AI as just that, rather than as a de facto acquisition. Ford's majority stake, Fields said, leaves equity available for Argo AI to fight the "war for talent" and provide incentives for the best engineers and leaders to come work for the company. In a sense, Ford is functioning here both as a technology partner, lending vast global scale to Argo AI's development, and as a venture capitalist. The automaker and Argo AI called this a "hybrid" model and said that it had been much discussed prior to the investment decision being made. "The real advantages came to the forefront," said Raj Nair. "It was an ideal way to solve the problem."

Snap will spend $1 billion on Amazon cloud services, amended filing shows Posted yesterday by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Tesla said to be aiming to start test production of Model 3 on February 20 In addition to the $2 billion Snap committed to spending on Google cloud infrastructure over the next five years, the company also revealed today in an amended filing that it expects to spend $1 billion on Amazon’s cloud services over the same time frame. However, the company clarified that it may choose to build its own infrastructure in the future. Snap’s agreement with Amazon has it spending $50 million this year, then increase its spending in subsequent years until it reaches $350 million in 2021. The amended filing was spotted this morning by Recode and Reuters, which both noted the sizable deal with Google, and how Snap is committed to using Google’s infrastructure for the vast majority of its business, including computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services. But the deal with Amazon indicates that Snap is not restricted to using only Google’s cloud as it moves forward. As Snap explains, “our agreement with Google requires that we use their cloud services for substantially all of our hosting requirements,” adding that a Google Cloud disruption of service could harm its business, as could having to transition to a new provider – a move that would be costly, too. Also included in the updated filing was more information about how Snap sees the broader competitive landscape around the world. It noted that users outside of North America and Europe tend to consume Snap’s content more than they create it – something the company attributed to a variety of factors, including the lack of high-speed cellular access in some regions. This requires users to wait until they’re in an area that has high-speed Wi-Fi, Snap said, which translates into less frequent daily usage as you’d see in developed market. Those users instead will spend more time watching Stories, instead of sending Snaps and Chats, the company said. This broadcast model where a few users post content many others consume leaves Snap susceptible to competition by broadcast-oriented platforms. “Fewer Snaps and Chats sent means fewer notifications inviting friends back into the application and therefore lower and more sporadic daily use,” explained Snap. The amended filing was published a week after the company’s IPO registration, where the company is looking to raise $3 billion.

Google officially brings WebVR to Chrome Posted yesterday by Lucas Matney (@lucas_matney) 0 SHARES Next Story The Analogue Nt Mini is the perfect NES console for video game lovers Virtual reality is coming to the web. Using VR on your phone has always been a pretty deliberate decision, you slot your phone into a headset, navigate the internal menus and home screens and launch apps and experiences from within the headset. Now, Google is making it easier to discover VR content spontaneously by bringing WebVR to Chrome. Previously Chrome lacked mobile browser support for WebVR, meaning that the browser couldn’t gather any data regarding the phone’s position and orientation or input controller. With this data, Chrome has the ability to offer pretty rich experiences. Users can navigate to a particular webpage, tap on a WebVR experience and have the option of navigating it with their finger (or mouse on desktop) or tossing the phone into their Daydream View to embrace a more immersive experience. In December, Google rolled out support for the WebVR API to a beta of Chrome, but now that update is going wide. WebVR allows companies and content creators to delve into the world of creating VR experiences without having to host those experiences in a native VR app. This update to Chrome not only allows websites to host 360-degree videos that users can view, but it also supports enabling full experiences with the Daydream headset and controller. In Google’s blog post, the company highlighted some early partners including SketchFab, Matterport, and PlayCanvas. Right now, this expansion is limited to users of Google’s Daydream headsets as well as people viewing the VR content on their phone or desktop without a headset. Google says they plan to add support for other headsets soon, including their own Cardboard platform. Given that this only works for Daydream, iPhone users are obviously not included here, but iOS may see some love once Google rolls out full Cardboard support. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Virtual Reality Popular Posts Featured Stories Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report VIDEO | 2:38 | Crunch Report Carl Bass on his surprising Autodesk exit — and what’s next 13 hours ago | Connie Loizos Uncorking innovation with Treasury Wine Estates in Napa 14 hours ago | Lora Kolodny Beats X bring Apple’s wireless headphone tech to a tethered form factor 15 hours ago | Brian Heater Facebook says it will open up for independent ad audit 18 hours ago | Anthony Ha Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report: Prince returns to Spotify 9 hours ago | Anthony Ha Weekly Roundup: Tech companies rally against Trump’s immigration ban, Zenefits cuts workforce again 10 hours ago | Anna Escher Trump’s immigration ban is terrible for entrepreneurs 10 hours ago | Samia Bahsoun Payback’s a gift 11 hours ago | Talia Goldberg, Jeremy Levine Comment moderation powered by Up Next The Analogue Nt Mini is the perfect NES console for video game lovers Posted yesterday CrunchBoard Job Listings Data Migration Consultant at Exerp (West Palm Beach, FL, United States) Integration Consultant at Exerp (West Palm Beach, FL, United States) SENIOR ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE at Waxman Strategies (Washington, DC, United States) Senior Backend Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Senior Data Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

And in Google’s opinion, if you’re going to ever play music on the Home, you might as well stream everything from the company’s streaming service, Play Music. To demonstrate how well the Home and Play Music work together, Google has announced that it is hosting a couple of block parties in LA and NYC… To show off the different ways you can utilize the Home with Play Music, Google has built three mini houses within a tiny neighborhood. The company is bringing along Wong Fu Productions, MyCupcakeAddiction, and Us the Duo so that they can demonstrate how you can ask Google Home to play different music mixes based on your mood or current activity. Google’s LA block party will be taking place February 11 and 12, at 1515 Abbot Kinney Blvd. Venice Beach, CA. Don’t worry about rushing down there as they will be open both days from 10 AM until 7 PM. The NYC event will take place later in the month from February 24 to 26. You can check it out at 75 9th Ave. New York, NY. It will be open from 10 AM to 9 PM on that Friday and Saturday but will close earlier at 6 PM on Sunday.

Julia Ioffe of The Atlantic, said she received a warning about two weeks ago. Another day, another state-sponsored phishing attack. pic.twitter.com/rlzI7s1jBE — Julia Ioffe (@juliaioffe) January 27, 2017 New York Magazine's Jonathan Chait said he received a warning about a government-backed hacker as recently as two or three weeks ago from Google. He also said he was "contacted over email by a stranger who offered to help me by giving me an encryption key to protect me from hackers. He would not give me his name, meet me or talk on the phone, despite repeated requests." This person reportedly also contacted Dan Goodin of Ars Technica and David Frum, James Fallows and Adam Serwer of the Atlantic. "The fact that all this started right after the election suggests to me that journalists are the next wave to be targeted by state-sponsored hackers in the way that Democrats were during it," said an unnamed journalist who received a warning from Google. "I worry that the outcome is going to be the same: Someone, somewhere, is going to get hacked, and then the contents of their gmail will be weaponized against them — and by extension all media." A Google spokesperson said that receiving a warning does not mean that the account has been compromised, and that they were sent because of "an abundance of caution." "Since 2012, we've notified users when we believe their Google accounts are being targeted by government-backed attackers," the spokesperson said in a statement. "We send these warnings out of an abundance of caution — they do not indicate that a user's account has already been compromised or that a more widespread attack is occurring when they receive the notice."

Regardless, Google continues to add new features that are supposed to make the AI assistant more useful to those using it. The Mountain View company confirmed last month that Google Assistant will provide Pixel users with more options to command their smart devices. Google has even implemented this feature for a handful of smart devices manufactured by Belkin, Wemo, and Honeywell. Today, Google pushed another update that allows Pixel owners to control even more smart devices. According to 9to5Google, the new “Home control” feature will show up on Pixel smartphones running Android 7.1.1 with Google app 6.11 and Play Services 10.2.98.

Sure, Google’s use of machine learning might not be anything new, but understanding how it’s using this technology is vital for the sector which can sometimes struggle to satisfy its notoriously fickle and savvy customer base. NB: This is an analysis by Daniel Bensley, travel industry lead at Qubit. To me, this report highlights a wider challenge for the industry around our approach to AI and machine learning techniques. Whether it’s Google changing its search ranking metrics or technology’s impact on jobs in the sector, headlines around AI are often more likely to spark fear rather than excitement. The fact of the matter is that everyone, across all sectors, needs to better understand how to harness this technology to identify, reach and engage with customers. For the travel industry, in particular, the benefits can be enormous if the technology is understood. Supercharge segmentation The travel sector has regularly outspent all other industries on pay-per-click ads, yet with sometimes as many as 80% of customers abandoning their shopping carts on travel websites there is clearly a wide gap between acquisition and satisfaction. Put simply, travel brands have spent too much time and money trying to attract eyes to their websites instead of thinking about how they can delight customers when they arrive on the site. Naturally travel’s sale cycles tend to be longer and involve a greater degree of research than other sectors, but there is still plenty of room for improvement for operators looking to provide a more relevant, satisfying experience for customers – this can only be achieved by building a better understanding of who your customers are and what they need. Segmentation in travel is nothing new – the sector is in a fantastic position since customers are only too happy to hand over information about who they are and what they are searching for. But many operators are still only scratching the surface, building basic, core segments, using limited data such as “First-time customers vs Repeat customers” or varied stages of the purchase journey. Machine learning can add to and analyse data about a visitor’s behaviour and needs far quicker than any human can, in order to create a hyper-detailed picture of that customer and build deeper, more sophisticated segments. For example, a customer may let you know they’re based in the UK and searching for a family holiday for two adults and two children. A deeper analysis of previous purchase behaviour, combined with real-time customer feedback could tell you that this customer is in the ‘intent to purchase’ phase and likely to be interested in short haul flights, within the school holidays and would respond best to speaking to a call centre adviser. Armed with these insights, a travel brand can then choose how to best engage with this customer in a much more meaningful way than before. With so many variables to factor into travel marketing, machine learning represents a tremendous opportunity for businesses to become far more accurate and targeted with their segmentation efforts. Uncover new opportunities Those headlines that examine the opportunities of AI tend to focus on the end of the funnel – a host of brands have rolled out chatbots to assist customers in finding low-cost flights, while VisitOrlando attracted plaudits for its bot that went a step further and could point interested travellers in the direction of popular brunch spots and craft beer bars. This is obviously the sexier end of the AI spectrum, but in my opinion, the real opportunity is far less visible and much more powerful. AI and machine learning can not only supercharge travel brands’ existing segmentation practices by answering questions about who your customers are – it can help spot entirely new opportunities by identifying more nuanced patterns in this data that would otherwise go unnoticed by a human analyst. Brands can then choose what they want to serve up to these new segments. As we approach St Valentine’s Day you may see customers searching for city breaks during the evening of February 13 are open to spending more than those browsing during for couples getaways in late January. You can make up your own mind on whether these are forgetful last-minute spouses desperately searching for a last-minute gift – machine learning’s role here is to flag the new pattern. You can then decide how you can better serve these desperate customers and point them in the direction of temporary offers for romantic getaways that suit their needs and boost your average order value at the same time. AI shouldn’t be approached as a panacea for the travel sector, but it shouldn’t be feared either. As it stands, machine learning is an incredibly useful tool that allows travel operators to seize opportunities they don’t know exist yet, but like any tool it’s important to not jump in and start using it before having a clear understanding of how you want to use it and the outcomes you want to see. You also need to ensure you’re feeding your AI platform the right data – provide useless information, expect useless results. Ultimately we do need to be careful in developing AI, but not for the reasons many believe. The danger isn’t that we lose control, lose our jobs (it will free us up to do more meaningful tasks) or that Google decides your website isn’t important enough. The true danger is that we let this tech revolution pass us by without tapping into its true potential beyond headline-grabbing bots. AI’s untapped opportunities are legion – if it screws up, then we’re to blame. NB: This is an analysis by Daniel Bensley, travel industry lead at Qubit.

There were none in the article. Reply 7 days ago   Andy We use it for inferring intent for each customer. It means we can then automatically change the sort order (of hotels or holidays, for example) and make them “probably” much better suited to an individual user. There are so many combinations that it would not be possible to do this with normal segmentation or by using hypotheses. Still much room to improve but the results are good and we see more and more uses for the data models that are refined and altered in real time. Reply 5 days ago   Dorian Harris @Andy I get the theory, I’ve just never seen it work in practice, so it would be good to see what you’re working on. From the AI solutions I have experienced first hand, iTunes ‘Genius’ recommendations fall a long way short of genius and Amazon’s ‘you may also like’ throws out loads of rubbish. From what I can see, even Google isn’t a pure AI solution – it’s a rule based system, uploaded in bulk every so often. Here at Skoosh we developed a rule-based fraud system which out-performed all the AI based solutions offered by banks, again despite the fact that banks have far more data to work with. The only time where AI out-performed manual solutions for us was on data-matching which is a completely different use-case to product recommendations.

Reply 7 days ago   Martin Cowley eRoam delivers complex itineraries in seconds to the 18-35 fit traveller using AI to match transport, accommodation, activities etc to the traveler’s profile. Profile is either manually entered or accessed by e.g. Facebook. The content is continuously scanned and made more relevant using social media and other sources to identify what is currently ‘trending’. The content is instantly bookable. It has both B2C and B2B applications. I’ll be happy to arrange a demo if interested. It’s the only way to show you the reality of eRoam’s capability.

Learn how to install its worthy drop-in replacement, Pixel Launcher, on a non-Pixel phone. By Jack Wallen | February 10, 2017, 10:06 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen One of the mainstays for the Android home screen, Google Now Launcher, is reportedly saying "Goodbye World." It is rumored that, as of March 1, 2017, the popular home screen launcher will no longer be available on the Google Play Store. Why is Google Now Launcher being discontinued? The reasons why Google is discontinuing this outstanding launcher are unclear. An anonymous tipster from within Google posted this on the android-dms-announcements@googlegroups.com mailing list: The email (which you can see below) explains that the Search Launcher Services library for OEMs that has been in testing is now available. This library is that same one used by certain OEMs (such as Sony) to integrate Google Now into their own home screen launchers. Now that the Search Launcher Services library is available, all OEMs can add Google Now to their home screen launchers...so the need to have the official Google Now Launcher available might be seen as a redundancy by Google. Couple that with the release of the Pixel Launcher, and Google feels it's time to let go of their aging Launcher. If you ask the public, this is a mistake. The Google Now Launcher is one of the best ways to get a pure Google experience on Android. Why is Pixel Launcher a worthy replacement? If you own one of the much-lauded Google Pixel phones, you know the native home screen launcher is fantastic and is also one of the most elegant-looking launchers for Android. The key features for Pixel Launcher include: View Google Now cards (long press the home button and tap the Google Now button) Access the app drawer with a quick swipe up Quick access to Google Search App suggestions at the top of your app drawer Long-press apps that support shortcuts to see the shortcuts menu (such as long-pressing the Chrome launcher to open a new tab directly) More about Mobility Apple iPhone 7 is being hardened to handle military-grade secrets Why mobile app developers may soon be looking for a new job Download: Remote access policy Subscribe to our Mobile Enterprise newsletter If you don't own a Pixel phone and open the Google Play Store on your non-Pixel device and search for Pixel Launcher, you'll see that your device isn't supported. It seems Google is leaving everyone else out, but there's a way around this: You can side-load Pixel Launcher on a non-Pixel device. Before doing that, please note: not all the features work as you might hope (for instance, on certain devices the swipe-right to reveal Google Now and the shortcuts feature do not work); and I have installed and scanned the apk file for malware, so the file to be installed is safe. Even though all of the features will not work, Pixel Launcher is still worth installing, especially if you're a fan of Google Now Launcher. SEE: Google Pixel phone: The smart person's guide (TechRepublic) How to install Pixel Launcher It's very rare for me to encourage side-loading an application; it's not a best practice, and it should only be done with applications you're certain are okay. The source for the apk to be installed is APKMirror, a site run by the reputable and highly respected Android Police, so the Pixel Launcher apk is good to go. Download the apk file on your Android device. While the file is downloading, open Settings and go to Security. Within the Security window, enable Unknown Sources (Figure A). Figure A Enabling Unknown Sources on the OnePlus 3. Swipe down your notification shade and tap the entry that indicates the download has completed. If you don't see that, open your device's file manager app and navigate to Downloads. Locate and tap the file com.google.android.nexuslauncher_XXX_apkmirror.apk (XXX is the release number). When prompted, tap Install (Figure B), and the apk file installation will complete. Figure B Installing Pixel Launcher The next time you press the Home button you'll be asked which launcher to use—tap Pixel Launcher and tap ALWAYS. You'll be greeted by your new Google-powered launcher (Figure C). Figure C Pixel Launcher on a Nexus 6. You're ready to start working with this worthy replacement for the Google Now Launcher. Although it doesn't offer all the features found when used in conjunction with the Pixel phone, it does a great job as a drop-in replacement for the launcher Google is leaving behind. A note about Pixel Launcher updates Pixel Launcher will not show up in the Play Store on your device. If you want to check for updates, you must head back over to the Apk Mirror site, search for Pixel Launcher, and download any newer files.

Google Warns Some They Have Been Targeted By State-Sponsored Hackers By AJ Dellinger On 02/10/17 AT 2:30 PM Close Hacks performed by foreign entities was a primary feature of the 2016 United States Presidential election. While the election may be over, the hacks aren’t done. Prominent journalists in the U.S. have reportedly been targeted by state-sponsored hackers, according to warnings from Google. Politico reports the notification of attempted attacks have started to appear for many well-known American journalists. According to some of the reporters, the warnings have been appearing for weeks or even months. Included among the affected journalists are Julia Ioffe of the Atlantic, Jonathan Chait of New York Magazine , Vox founder Ezra Klein, GQ special contributor Keith Olbermann, CNN senior media reporter Brian Stelter, New York Times national security correspondent David Sanger and columnist Paul Krugman, Yahoo Washington bureau chief Garance Franke-Ruta. The crop of top reporters have spotted a bright red bar that appears atop the GMail inbox when Google believes a person is being targeted. “Warning: Google may have detected government-backed attackers trying to steal your password,” the notification reads. Google sends the warnings out as a means of alerting people they may want to take extra steps to secure their account. It is primarily a precautionary move and doesn’t mean an account receiving the notification has already been compromised. Related Stories Cyber Attack Suspected On Italian Foreign Ministry Similar To Trump Election 2016 Twitter Warns Users Of State-Sponsored Cyberattacks Google began issuing users warnings of potential state-sponsored attacks in 2012. When the warning is sent, Google provides the recipient with a number of options to help lock down their account, including creating a more secure password, making sure their browser and other software is up to date and enabling two-factor authentication. It’s unclear what the motivation of the attempted hacks may be. Given the successful dissemination of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, it’s possible the hackers intend to leak private conversations from the press to an organization like WikiLeaks. The apparent targeting of journalists has gone beyond just hacking attempts as well. Chait has reportedly received an email from a stranger offering to provide him with an encryption key. The person wouldn’t disclose any additional details or meet or talk with the reporter. Other journalists including David Frum, James Fallows and Adam Serwer of the Atlantic , Andrew Sullivan of New York Magazine and Ars Technica’s Dan Goodin also received the email.

Name: Subject: Message: Play Store now starting to show both original and sale prices for apps Newsby Andrew Grush13 hours ago 2 210 6 While there are plenty of great things about the Google Play store, it’s certainly not perfect. Thankfully Google continues to refine the store slowly but surely, adding little features along the way that make our mobile lives just that little bit easier. Case in point, it seems Google is now making it easier to see when a game is on sale. As you might already know, this isn’t exactly new to the Play Store, as this feature has been available for a while for movies, books, and music. Interestingly enough, the games that are marked on sale so far seem to be only of a Batman-themed nature. This includes a few LEGO Batman titles as well as Teeny Titans – Teen Titans Go! Checking out other non-Batman-related titles that we know are on sale yields no similar sales tags just yet. This could likely have to do with the today’s arrival of the LEGO Batman Movie, though hopefully it comes to other games and apps in short order. For those curious, these changes aren’t just for the Google Play app, but also seem to apply to the web listings via Chrome as well.

SUBSCRIBE Cool tricks to explore Google’s Knowledge Graph results, featuring Donald Trump Whether you want to gain some insight into how Google's Knowledge Graph works or you just want to prank your friends, columnist Tony Edward shows some cool tricks for changing up the SERP display with URL modifiers. Tony Edward on February 9, 2017 at 11:44 am More Kashin / Shutterstock.com By now the majority of searchers on Google are familiar with the Knowledge Graph box, which appears on the right side of the search results page and highlights information about various entities (companies, people, places, things and so on). In the past, I’ve written about how to both obtain and optimize a Knowledge Graph result. In my attempts to learn more and get a better understanding of Google’s Knowledge Graph, I’ve discovered some cool hacks and tricks. While these tricks do not have any significant practical implications, they can serve as a way to better understand how Google’s Knowledge Graph works, which can be used to optimize your personal or company Knowledge Graph results. Before getting into the tricks, let’s break down some important items. For the examples below, I used Donald Trump. Google Knowledge Graph API The Google Knowledge Graph API is a tool that can be used to get insight into your Knowledge Graph result. It provides details about classification of the entity, score and ranking. It also provides a machine-generated identifier (MID), which is a unique code assigned to each entity. MID (machine-generated identifier) Machine-generated identifiers, or MIDs, are unique entity IDs that were originally generated from Freebase. Although Freebase was ultimately shut down and the data was migrated to Wikidata, Google is still using the Freebase identifier codes for entities. This could eventually change to Wikidata Qids, but we have to wait and see what Google will do. As you can see below, in the Knowlege Graph API results for “donald trump,” the president’s entity MID is /m/0cqt90. Normal search engine results page (SERP) Here is what the normal SERP looks like when a search for “Donald Trump” is completed. As you can see, Trump is an entity and has a detailed Knowledge Graph panel appearing alongside his search results. https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump Knowledge Graph tricks Knowledge Graph-only SERP By inserting the following modifiers into the search URL, we can have just the Knowledge Graph Panel appear on the SERP, with no paid or organic listings. Modifiers: kponly  (a command that tweaks the SERPs to only show the Knowledge Graph panel) kgmid= (a command that allows the SERP to be filtered specifically for the specified entity; simply add the MID number after the equal sign) Original URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump Modified URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump&kponly&kgmid=/m/0cqt90 Change the language of content in the Knowledge Graph Adding the hl string to the URL and specifying a language code will change the language of the Knowledge Graph SERP. Here is an example of the content changed to Spanish. Original URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump Modified URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump&kponly&kgmid=/m/0cqt90&hl=es Change related images in the Knowledge Graph panel Another trick that can be done is to change the related images within the Knowledge Graph panel to items you specify in your search query. For example, a regular search for “donald trump mexico” does not return a Knowledge Graph result. However, by appending the MID to the search results URL, we can generate a Knowledge Graph result that contains images relevant to the search query. Original URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump+mexico Modified URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump+mexico&kgmid=/m/0cqt90 Generate a Knowledge Graph panel for an entity for any search query This trick is my favorite, as it’s great for a prank or joke. Applying the same tactic from the previous example allows you to have a Knowledge Graph panel for your specified MID appear on the SERP for any search query — even if your Knowledge Graph entity is not related to your search. Original URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=homer+simpson Modified URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=homer+simpson&kgmid=/m/0cqt90 Note that this trick will override an existing Knowledge Graph panel for an entity. Without the “hacked” URL, a search for “Homer Simpson” generates a Knowledge Graph result for Homer Simpson, as expected.   I hope this helps shed some light on how some parts of Google’s Knowledge Graph work. It can be useful if you’re redirecting users to a Google SERP result for reasons related to business or humor.

Are Top Topics Americans Googled Since Election By Denisse Moreno On 02/10/17 AT 2:12 PM Close The divisive presidential race between President Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had people turning to Google for information. Now, Americans are using the search engine to learn more about cabinet picks, the latest executive orders and even asking about Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s gum chewing, according Google data analyzed by Estately shared by Distractify . The presidential election dominated searches on Google last year, according to the search engine’s data released December 2016. Trump took the first spot, followed by Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who was the fourth most googled person in 2016. After Trump took office, Estately, a home searching platform, used Google trends to analyze search traffic for hundreds of names, terms and questions. Estately found what Americans in each state have been searching for the most on Google since Trump was inaugurated. Searches in Alabama included looking for information on Jeff Sessions, and for those who didn’t pay attention in history class “who is Frederick Douglass?” after Sean Spicer and Trump suggested the abolitionist was still alive (he died in 1895). Meanwhile, Indiana residents googled “Cheetos bronzer” and those in Kansas searched for “Kellyanne Conway punch,” after she allegedly hit a man at an inauguration party. In New York, people were more interested in whether President Barack Obama would be able to run again, and in California people googled “Is Donald Trump a sociopath?” and “Will the world end in 2017?” or “Are we going to die?.” Here is the complete list of Google searches across U.S. states: ALABAMA :  Jeff Sessions / Will Jeff Sessions be the next Attorney General? / Who is Frederick Douglass?

You Can Now Add Smart Home Devices To Google Assistant On The Pixel Eric Ravenscraft Feb 11, 2017, 6:00am ⋅ Filed to:  android google pixel smart home Share Google Assistant has some really weird inconsistencies. For example, up until recently, you could control smart home devices from your Pixel phone, but only if you added them from a Google Home first. Now, you can skip the Home. As Android Police points out, if you have a Pixel, you can open up the Google Assistant settings and add smart home devices such as those from Nest, Philips and Belkin. To do it, follow these steps: Launch Google Assistant by holding down the Home button. Tap the three-button menu icon and choose Settings. Tap Home Control. Tap the plus button at the bottom of the screen to add a new device. Once the device is added, you'll be able to control it with voice commands from Google Assistant on your Pixel. If you have a Google Home, the commands should work there, too. However, it's unclear if you can control them from other Assistant-enabled devices, since the assistant is notoriously fragmented. Still, this is a step in the right direction. Google Assistant on Pixel gets proper home control with multi-room support, no Google Home required [Android Police] Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

A Google Chromebook displays Adobe Lightroom in New York. The computers have defied expectations and made tremendous inroads in one of the least likely places: U.S. schools. ASSOCIATED PRESS A Google Chromebook displays Candy Crush Saga in New York. ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK (AP) — The Google Chromebook, a type of stripped-down laptop, isn’t a practical mobile device for many people — mostly because it basically turns into an expensive paperweight whenever it can’t find a Wi-Fi connection. Yet Chromebooks have defied expectations and made major inroads in an unexpected environment — U.S. schools. In retrospect, that shouldn’t be too surprising. Chromebooks are cheap and easy to manage, making them popular with budget-constrained schools with limited tech-support staff. And Wi-Fi is now common enough in U.S. schools and homes to make an internet-dependent device practical for students. Google doesn’t want to stop there. It’s releasing new models in partnership with Samsung that are designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers. They have several tablet-like features, including a stylus, touch controls and a 360-degree hinge that allows you to turn the screen faceup. One starts selling Sunday for $449; a more powerful version comes out in April for $100 more. Google and its manufacturing partners are trying to shed the Chromebook’s perception as underperforming budget devices. But even with premium models, expanding beyond U.S. schools won’t be easy. Chromebooks get schooled For personal computers and tablets, Chromebook’s share of the U.S. education market was 49 percent last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2013, according to IDC figures released this week. But education accounts for just 14 percent of the 110 million devices shipped in the U.S. last year — and Chromebooks make up just 9 percent of that broader total. Their numbers are also low abroad, even in schools. The Chromebook’s popularity in U.S. education is also largely limited to grades K-12, analysts say. Macs and Windows laptops are still dominant on college campuses. Rough start Chromebooks use a lightweight operating system designed to get people online faster, without having to wait around for the computer to start up. Much of the heavy lifting on Chromebooks gets done on Google’s remote servers, so Chromebooks themselves don’t need fast chips or lots of storage. Early on, though, that made Chromebooks seem cheap and underpowered, which “soured consumer expectations right off the bat,” IDC analyst Linn Huang said. Online storage for photos and documents online was much less common in 2011 when Chromebooks launched , so their limited local storage was initially unappealing. And the few apps available for Chromebooks didn’t work offline, at least at the time. Differing needs But what constrains consumers can actually be liberating in education. Most kids don’t need laptops on the bus or other locations where they can’t connect to Wi-Fi. And they don’t miss business software like Microsoft Office; Google’s online apps for documents and spreadsheets do just fine for homework. “What surprised us was how quickly it took off in education,” said Kan Liu, who oversees Chromebooks at Google. Apple’s iPad was hot at the time, but Google sold the Chromebook on convenience. They’re easier for classrooms to share; just sign in with a Google account, and a student’s apps and documents instantly appear. Teachers also have online tools to lock down what apps and sites students can use. And with models available for less than $200, schools can get a few Chromebooks for the price of an iPad or a rival laptop. “It allows us to put more devices in students’ hands,” said Aaron Slutsky, chief technology officer for McDowell County Schools in North Carolina. Far from universal But Chromebook’s success story in schools is largely an American one, and it’s likely to stay that way. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa notes that Chromebooks are useless in China because the device depends on Google services that aren’t available there. And in emerging countries, where a budget laptop would be ideal, she said internet access isn’t reliable enough. Even in the U.S., the iPad is better for many creative tasks such as recording and editing movies. Students studying engineering, robotics and graphics won’t be able to use Chromebooks to run the kind of specialized software that’s available for Macs and Windows laptops. “But that’s not needed for 98 percent of our students,” said Tracy Dabbs, coordinator of technology and innovation at the Burlington-Edison School District near Seattle. Many school districts limit Apple and Windows computers for the students who specifically need them, then provide Chromebooks for the rest. McDowell County, for instance, has 5,500 Chromebooks, 1,200 iPads — and only 100 Macs and 200 Windows PCs. Rivals stage a comeback Last year, Apple gave iPads in schools some Chromebook-like features unavailable to the general public. That includes ways to let multiple people use a single tablet and management tools for tech-support staff. A new Classroom app lets teachers control what apps students run and track their progress. Apple also provides classroom tools for teachers and students. Free e-books offer teachers step-by-step guides on using iPad apps and curriculum suggestions for everyday subjects. A separate app lets kids learn programming using the same language developers use to build iPad apps. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced last month new online apps and management tools for schools, along with Windows PCs priced similarly to Chromebooks. Beyond schools Huang said some businesses are giving Chromebooks a second look, especially in retail, banking and other settings where people share computers. But in many offices, the lack of business software such as Office is a major hurdle. Google’s alternative lacks many advanced capabilities found in Office, and habits are hard to change. Google is trying to make Chromebooks more palatable by letting them run Android apps designed for phones and tablets. It’s testing this capability on a handful of Chromebook models, including the new ones from Samsung. That makes it possible to install Office, Adobe Photoshop and many apps on a Chromebook, though these tablet versions have limited features compared with versions for Macs or Windows laptops.

Brave brands like Coco-Cola, Air B&B, Audi, Budweiser, and 84 Lumber made their message loud and clear, while Go Daddy, T-Mobile, and Google Home were more subdued. Even the entertainment in the opener and half-time shows were on point. Here’s a rundown of what I saw: Inclusion was in the air from the very start. The cast from Hamilton set the tone for the evening by updating ‘America the Beautiful’ adding “and sisterhood” to the lyrical reference of brotherhood. The moment was best captured when the camera caught the look of surprise on Falcons coach Dan Quinn’s face when he heard the edited lyrics and smiled. I suspect there were millions more smiling with the small, but powerful addition to song. The timing being so close to the historical turn out for the Women’s March. Shortly after the opening, a second performance of ‘America the Beautiful’ came in the form of Coke’s 2014 commercial, ‘Together is Beautiful’. Its multi-lingual, multi-cultural version of the song delivered a strong message that America isn’t one language, one religion, or one race, but one ideal. Lady Gaga also delivered on the theme in a big way during her half-time show. She performed a cover of Woody Guthrie’s Americana classic “This Land Is Your Land” with the lyrics, “This land is made for you and me.” Followed by her hit song, ‘Born this Way’, an anthem for self-confidence and inclusion, especially with the LGBTQ crowd. Budweiser and 84 Lumber’s coming to America stories were well timed and most importantly for an ad, got everyone talking. 84 Lumber’s spot which was too controversial for TV (aka Fox censored the ad) required you to go online to see the conclusion. The ad worked because during the half-time show, due to an overload of traffic, the website crashed. Tackling the politically heavy topic of immigration is risky – you either loved it, or took to Twitter to call for a boycott. Google Home and Air B&B both had themes of diversity and acceptance. In Google’s ad, multi-national and multi-lingual families who had homes adorned with items, like a gay pride flag and a mezuzah, welcomed people in with loving hugs. Yet, the only headline Google will probably get will be for its technology and how the commercial activated the device for viewers at home. Air B&B tackled the immigration ban head on with a powerful message saying “we all belong”. Their message is backed by a 4M pledge to the International Rescue Committee. I’m heartened to see our business leaders being good global citizens too, by standing up for those most in need. This isn’t a brand exploiting an issue, this is a brand standing for something. Another example of a progressive sentiment from a tech brand is Expedia. We’re shown a woman who expands her horizons with foreign travel. She witnesses soldiers guarding a border, and at one point embraces what appears to be a child refugee who’s making landfall in an inflatable boat. But, let’s get personal for a moment. The spot that moved me the most was ‘Daughter’, by Audi which promotes gender equality. As a female working in a male dominated industry, this particularly hit home. There’s absolutely no subtlety about it. From the boys that jest and de-value her at the starting line to the provocative narration of her father during the race. It asks an important question about one of the biggest social issues of today: “What do I tell my daughter?” I relished in the story juxtaposed to an event known for its hyper-masculinity, especially hearing the question coming from a male perspective since the louder voices on the issue come mainly from women. This ad is a call for progress and I believe it is one of the best this year – a true inspiration. The most improved player goes to Go Daddy. The brand is finally climbing out of its sexist hole from years past. Their spot incorporated an “Easter Egg” referencing the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC), the world’s largest conference for female technologists with a #GHC17 button pinned to Internet’s backpack. With Go Daddy cleaning up their image, I was somewhat surprised, I only spotted two ads with bikini-clad women this year. That’s progress! However, one was a teaser for the new Baywatch movie. I feel like a free pass for that spot is justified. I mean, how else would you promote Baywatch? Finally, for all the young athletes out there. T-Mobile, featuring Justin Bieber, celebrated the game with its #unlimitedmoves campaign. Towards the end of the spot, a young football player spikes the ball and shows everyone that girls can have moves on the field too. You could have blinked and missed it. T-Mobile isn’t exactly a sports brand, but the casting choice was intentional. It sends a message that females have a place in the male dominated world of football. Unity, diversity, and inclusion was a thread through much of the game – sometimes obvious, sometimes not so obvious. With the nation on edge politically, it’s amazing how an ad that would have seemed apolitical just a couple of years ago can suddenly feel like a fierce statement. Businesses are sticking their necks out at the risk of social media warfare. With the threat of recent boycotts, I commend the brands, like 84 Lumber, Budweiser, Air B&B and Audi that have the guts to stand for something. How quickly times have changed, that when having a message of unity and inclusion can be so controversial. Love it or hate it, these are the spots that are winning because these are the spot that are sparking the most conversation.

SUBSCRIBE Cool tricks to explore Google’s Knowledge Graph results, featuring Donald Trump Whether you want to gain some insight into how Google's Knowledge Graph works or you just want to prank your friends, columnist Tony Edward shows some cool tricks for changing up the SERP display with URL modifiers. Tony Edward on February 9, 2017 at 11:44 am More Kashin / Shutterstock.com By now the majority of searchers on Google are familiar with the Knowledge Graph box, which appears on the right side of the search results page and highlights information about various entities (companies, people, places, things and so on). In the past, I’ve written about how to both obtain and optimize a Knowledge Graph result. In my attempts to learn more and get a better understanding of Google’s Knowledge Graph, I’ve discovered some cool hacks and tricks. While these tricks do not have any significant practical implications, they can serve as a way to better understand how Google’s Knowledge Graph works, which can be used to optimize your personal or company Knowledge Graph results. Before getting into the tricks, let’s break down some important items. For the examples below, I used Donald Trump. Google Knowledge Graph API The Google Knowledge Graph API is a tool that can be used to get insight into your Knowledge Graph result. It provides details about classification of the entity, score and ranking. It also provides a machine-generated identifier (MID), which is a unique code assigned to each entity. MID (machine-generated identifier) Machine-generated identifiers, or MIDs, are unique entity IDs that were originally generated from Freebase. Although Freebase was ultimately shut down and the data was migrated to Wikidata, Google is still using the Freebase identifier codes for entities. This could eventually change to Wikidata Qids, but we have to wait and see what Google will do. As you can see below, in the Knowlege Graph API results for “donald trump,” the president’s entity MID is /m/0cqt90. Normal search engine results page (SERP) Here is what the normal SERP looks like when a search for “Donald Trump” is completed. As you can see, Trump is an entity and has a detailed Knowledge Graph panel appearing alongside his search results. https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump Knowledge Graph tricks Knowledge Graph-only SERP By inserting the following modifiers into the search URL, we can have just the Knowledge Graph Panel appear on the SERP, with no paid or organic listings. Modifiers: kponly  (a command that tweaks the SERPs to only show the Knowledge Graph panel) kgmid= (a command that allows the SERP to be filtered specifically for the specified entity; simply add the MID number after the equal sign) Original URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump Modified URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump&kponly&kgmid=/m/0cqt90 Change the language of content in the Knowledge Graph Adding the hl string to the URL and specifying a language code will change the language of the Knowledge Graph SERP. Here is an example of the content changed to Spanish. Original URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump Modified URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump&kponly&kgmid=/m/0cqt90&hl=es Change related images in the Knowledge Graph panel Another trick that can be done is to change the related images within the Knowledge Graph panel to items you specify in your search query. For example, a regular search for “donald trump mexico” does not return a Knowledge Graph result. However, by appending the MID to the search results URL, we can generate a Knowledge Graph result that contains images relevant to the search query. Original URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump+mexico Modified URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump+mexico&kgmid=/m/0cqt90 Generate a Knowledge Graph panel for an entity for any search query This trick is my favorite, as it’s great for a prank or joke. Applying the same tactic from the previous example allows you to have a Knowledge Graph panel for your specified MID appear on the SERP for any search query — even if your Knowledge Graph entity is not related to your search. Original URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=homer+simpson Modified URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=homer+simpson&kgmid=/m/0cqt90 Note that this trick will override an existing Knowledge Graph panel for an entity. Without the “hacked” URL, a search for “Homer Simpson” generates a Knowledge Graph result for Homer Simpson, as expected.   I hope this helps shed some light on how some parts of Google’s Knowledge Graph work. It can be useful if you’re redirecting users to a Google SERP result for reasons related to business or humor.

Now it appears that it is Samsung’s turn to wade into the connected device and virtual assistant world, as the tech giant recently filed a trademark in Europe for a system dubbed “Hello” that sounds a lot like the already crowded field of digital assistants. BGR reports Samsung filed the trademark for Hello with the European Union Intellectual Property Office on Wednesday, describing the system as a process to aggregate and organize various types of content. According to the filing, the system would take on several different tasks, including: • Providing personalized features and information based on user’s preferences in the fields of weather, music, entertainment, games, travel, science, health, contact, and social news; • Scheduling and managing appointments, reminders, events and calendar entries on an electronic calendar; • Organizing and accessing phone numbers, addresses, and other personal contact information; • Using voice command and recognition to provide personalized features and information based on user’s preferences in the fields of weather, music, entertainment, games, travel, science, health, contact, and social news. BGR contends that because Hello appears to be a virtual assistant, it could be the official name for Bixby. Or it could serve as just an additional feature to Bixby, which is expected to be included on phones, computers, tablets, and other Samsung devices. No matter how Samsung plans to use Hello, Android Headlines notes that simply filing the trademark shows the tech company is ready to take on Google, Amazon, and Apple in the AI field.

The system, formerly confined to high-performance datacentres, now powers Android Wear 2.0's suggested message replies. The added reply options are a significant new Android Wear feature. Not only do they make it easier to respond to text messages but they also mark a step forward in the development of machine intelligence. The replies use advanced AI algorithms but require no internet connection. In a blog post yesterday, Google's research team detailed how it brought AI from server rooms to your wrist. The project started with Allo and Duo, Google's new messaging apps that use machine learning. The team behind the apps was approached by the Android Wear group and asked if Allo's Smart Reply could run on a watch. The answer was a resounding no. Smart Reply for smartwatches Recognising the opportunity to solve a unique problem, the team working on Smart Reply went back to the drawing board. Its work so far was thrown out as the focus shifted to building a new, lightweight machine learning architecture that runs offline. Just getting it working without an internet connection would have been a significant achievement. The team went a step further though, committing to bringing Smart Reply to smartwatches. As this week's announcement shows, it eventually succeeded. Improved match grouping The system is based on a new grouping mechanism that's faster and more efficient than existing models. Previous attempts to use on-device AI have revolved around simplistic systems based on rule mappings. These models can detect positive emotion in phrases like "I love this movie" but do not scale to understanding the diverse vocabularies encountered in real text message exchanges. Neural networks are required for this but they're demanding algorithms that won't run on a wearable's tiny processor. Projection model Google's new solution aims for a middle ground in between the two. It first groups similar messages by comparing them using vectors. A locality sensitive hashing system is able to reduce the number of potential matches from millions of unique words to a specific sequence of bits, allowing messages to be compared with each other. The information is then fed through a "projection model" that can predict probable replies based on previous learning. The complete system is highly complex and explained in more detail in Google's blog post. The outcome is an AI that can be trained using the cloud but then essentially downloaded to devices. The phone, tablet or wearable can then use an enhanced form of the inexpensive mapping procedures formerly used for on-device AI. "Excited about how well it works" In use, the system works well with much greater accuracy than previous models. Google said it performs better than anticipated, leading it to continue expanding the algorithms in the coming months. AI is now baked into new Android Wear smartwatches, without any strings to the cloud. "When we embarked on our journey to build this technology from scratch, we weren't sure if the predictions would be useful or of sufficient quality," said Google. "We're quite surprised and excited about how well it works even on Android wearable devices with very limited computation and memory resources." The development could be a pivotal point in the next evolution of AI. Over the next few years, machine intelligence is expected to move out of the datacentre and into the devices around you. They'll be able to help you while offline and reduce the time taken to respond to queries. Google is starting small with suggested message responses. However, the company said it's already using the model to build "completely new applications," hinting that on-device AI will do much more in the future.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Google may remove (or hide) Play Store apps that lack privacy policies 02/09/2017 at 5:00 PM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment There are more than 2.6 million Android apps available for download from the Google Play Store. But soon some of them may disappear… or at least get harder to find. The Next Web reports that Google is setting a note to some developers letting them know that they have until March 15th to make sure their apps comply with Google’s User Data policy. If they don’t, Google may remove those apps from the Play Store, or take steps to “limit the visibility” of apps. Specifically, Google says developers need to make sure their apps “provide a valid privacy policy when the app requests or handles sensitive user or device information.” In other words, if an app requests access to your device’s contact list, account, camera, mic, or phone feature, users need to be able to read about how their data will be used. The move is probably going to be a good one for users… for the most part. I suspect the apps that are least likely to be updated are older ones that are still available for download, but which may not be regularly updated by their developers. If you rely on apps that meet that description, you may want to make sure to save a backup of the installer in case Google purges your favorite apps from the Play Store.

Google Chromebook laptops are impractical for many people because they’re little more than expensive paperweights when they’re out of range of an internet connection. Yet they’ve defied expectations and made tremendous inroads in one of the least likely places: U.S. schools. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)(Credit: AP) NEW YORK — The Google Chromebook, a type of stripped-down laptop, isn’t a practical mobile device for many people — mostly because it basically turns into an expensive paperweight whenever it can’t find a Wi-Fi connection. Yet Chromebooks have defied expectations and made major inroads in an unexpected environment — U.S. schools. In retrospect, that shouldn’t be too surprising. Chromebooks are cheap and easy to manage, making them popular with budget-constrained schools with limited tech-support staff. And Wi-Fi is now common enough in U.S. schools and homes to make an internet-dependent device practical for students. Google doesn’t want to stop there. It’s releasing new models in partnership with Samsung that are designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers. They have several tablet-like features, including a stylus, touch controls and a 360-degree hinge that allows you to turn the screen face-up. One starts selling Sunday for $449; a more powerful version comes out in April for $100 more. Google and its manufacturing partners are trying to shed the Chromebook’s perception as underperforming budget devices. But even with premium models, expanding beyond U.S. schools won’t be easy. CHROMEBOOKS GET SCHOOLED For personal computers and tablets, Chromebook’s share of the U.S. education market was 49 percent last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2013, according to IDC figures released this week. But education accounts for just 14 percent of the 110 million devices shipped in the U.S. last year — and Chromebooks make up just 9 percent of that broader total. Their numbers are also low abroad, even in schools. The Chromebook’s popularity in U.S. education is also largely limited to grades K-12, analysts say. Macs and Windows laptops are still dominant on college campuses. ROUGH START Chromebooks use a lightweight operating system designed to get people online faster, without having to wait around for the computer to start up. Much of the heavy lifting on Chromebooks gets done on Google’s remote servers, so Chromebooks themselves don’t need fast chips or lots of storage. Early on, though, that made Chromebooks seem cheap and underpowered, which “soured consumer expectations right off the bat,” IDC analyst Linn Huang said. Online storage for photos and documents online was much less common in 2011 when Chromebooks launched, so their limited local storage was initially unappealing. And the few apps available for Chromebooks didn’t work offline, at least at the time. DIFFERING NEEDS But what constrains consumers can actually be liberating in education. Most kids don’t need laptops on the bus or other locations where they can’t connect to Wi-Fi. And they don’t miss business software like Microsoft Office; Google’s online apps for documents and spreadsheets do just fine for homework. “What surprised us was how quickly it took off in education,” said Kan Liu, who oversees Chromebooks at Google. Apple’s iPad was hot at the time, but Google sold the Chromebook on convenience. They’re easier for classrooms to share; just sign in with a Google account, and a student’s apps and documents instantly appear. Teachers also have online tools to lock down what apps and sites students can use. And with models available for less than $200, schools can get a few Chromebooks for the price of an iPad or a rival laptop. “It allows us to put more devices in students’ hands,” said Aaron Slutsky, chief technology officer for McDowell County Schools in North Carolina. FAR FROM UNIVERSAL But Chromebook’s success story in schools is largely an American one, and it’s likely to stay that way. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa notes that Chromebooks are useless in China because the device depends on Google services that aren’t available there. And in emerging countries, where a budget laptop would be ideal, she said internet access isn’t reliable enough. Even in the U.S., the iPad is better for many creative tasks such as recording and editing movies. Students studying engineering, robotics and graphics won’t be able to use Chromebooks to run the kind of specialized software that’s available for Macs and Windows laptops. “But that’s not needed for 98 percent of our students,” said Tracy Dabbs, coordinator of technology and innovation at the Burlington-Edison School District near Seattle. Many school districts limit Apple and Windows computers for the students who specifically need them, then provide Chromebooks for the rest. McDowell County, for instance, has 5,500 Chromebooks, 1,200 iPads — and only 100 Macs and 200 Windows PCs. RIVALS STAGE A COMEBACK Last year, Apple gave iPads in schools some Chromebook-like features unavailable to the general public. That includes ways to let multiple people use a single tablet and management tools for tech-support staff. A new Classroom app lets teachers control what apps students run and track their progress. Apple also provides classroom tools for teachers and students. Free e-books offer teachers step-by-step guides on using iPad apps and curriculum suggestions for everyday subjects. A separate app lets kids learn programming using the same language developers use to build iPad apps. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced last month new online apps and management tools for schools, along with Windows PCs priced similarly to Chromebooks. BEYOND SCHOOLS Huang said some businesses are giving Chromebooks a second look, especially in retail, banking and other settings where people share computers. But in many offices, the lack of business software such as Office is a major hurdle. Google’s alternative lacks many advanced capabilities found in Office, and habits are hard to change. Google is trying to make Chromebooks more palatable by letting them run Android apps designed for phones and tablets. It’s testing this capability on a handful of Chromebook models, including the new ones from Samsung. That makes it possible to install Office, Adobe Photoshop and many apps on a Chromebook, though these tablet versions have limited features compared with versions for Macs or Windows laptops.

Name: Subject: Message: Pixel XL is (mostly) back in stock on the Google Store site Newsby John Callaham16 hours ago 8 486 9 We have been reporting on the huge supply issues that have hit the Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones ever since the Android 7.1 Nougat handsets went on sale in late October. Indeed, people who have tried to get the more expensive 5.5-inch Pixel XL have encountered long shipping delays and “out of stock” messages on the Google Store site. Today, the Google Store finally started selling the Pixel XL again, in most of its models, after weeks of not being available to purchase. See also: Best Google Pixel Accessories 3 weeks ago As of this writing, the store listing shows the Quite Black version of the phone available to buy in both its 32GB and 128GB storage versions. The 32GB version is scheduled to ship in “2-3 weeks” but you will have to wait “4-5 weeks” for the 128GB version. The Very Silver 32GB version is also in stock, but it has a huge “6-7 weeks” shipping time frame. The Very Silver 128GB model of the Pixel XL is still showing as “out of stock” on the Google Store. The Really Blue 32GB version is also still not in stock (Google does not offer that Pixel XL model in a 128GB version). Obviously, this situation could change very quickly, so if you have your heart set on getting an unlocked Pixel XL, you might want to move right now before more “out of stock” message start showing up. You still also have the option of going to the Verizon Wireless website to order the Pixel XL, but as we have reported earlier this week, you will encounter long shipment times from that carrier as well. Indeed, some people who ordered the phone from that location are getting free Daydream View VR headsets from Verizon as an apology for the long delays in shipping the Pixel XL.

The move could affect millions of apps that don’t spell out what they do with user data. Developers worldwide have been receiving notices from Google this week, informing them that the company plans to “limit visibility” or to entirely remove such apps, according to The Next Web. That could be a whole lot of apps. Google Play store had some 2.6m apps as of December 2016, according to statistics portal Statista. Studies have found that mobile apps in general – both those in Google Play and in Apple’s app store – have been pretty dismal when it comes to privacy. In 2014, a coordinated study of apps run by a group of national privacy and data protection bodies from all around the world found that some 85% were failing to provide adequate information on the privacy implications of using the app. Google Play store app developers have until March 15 to do one of two things: either link to a “valid” privacy policy on their app store listing page and within their app, or stop asking for sensitive user data. According to Google’s User Data policy, developers must be “transparent” in how they collect, handle and share user data. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More That’s the bare minimum requirement, though. Requirements get stiffer still for personal and sensitive information. That includes personally identifiable information (PII), financial and payment information, authentication information, phonebook or contact data, microphone and camera sensor data, and sensitive device data. If an app collects that kind of user data, it’s required by the User Data policy to… Post a privacy policy in both the designated field in the Play Developer Console and from within the Play distributed app itself. Handle the user data securely, including transmitting it using modern cryptography (for example, over HTTPS). This is a good move both for the sake of user privacy and for the developers of (privacy-respecting) apps who’d like to get a bit more elbow room in the cluttered Google Play store. One developer, Jack Cooney, creator of the app Hip Hop Ninja, was singing the praises of the purge. TNW quoted him: I think it’s fantastic, this will clear the Google Play store of so many junk and zombie apps that our games will find increased visibility on the store as the search terms will become much less cluttered. This will make it easier for people to be able to find our app’s [sic] like Hop Hop Ninja! with better keyword searches like ninja or Nerd Agency and find much more relevant results.

It will be interesting to see what google says they do with the data they collect in apps. As in – google maps, yes they track people all the time even when the app is off. This is so they can give us great traffic info (how fast everyone is going). But do they ever stop tracking you? and who do they share it with? Personally I am concerned I’ll get a speeding ticket in Email some day after opening it up on an empty highway, or maybe even if at the drag track.

Robert Scoble, tech evangelist and co-author of “The Fourth Transformation” wearing his Microsoft HoloLens. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) Virtual and mixed reality technology is developing even more rapidly than many anticipated. For some, that’s a nightmare scenario, a foreshadowing of a dystopian future and a loss of human connection. For others, it is an immense opportunity. Robert Scoble falls distinctly in the second category. A blogger and tech evangelist, Scoble has been a vocal advocate for virtual and mixed reality, making the case and explaining the implications of these emerging technologies in the new book he co-authored with Shel Israel, “The Fourth Transformation: How Augmented Reality & Artificial Intelligence Will Change Everything.” On a recent episode of the GeekWire podcast, Scoble spoke with editor Todd Bishop and reporter Taylor Soper about his vision for this technology, and he says the future is closer than we think. “I predict within three years I’m not using a phone very often,” he said. “I’m using mostly [mixed reality] glasses, because with glasses you get as many virtual monitors as you want.” Scoble also predicted that Apple will announce a new line of mixed reality-enabled devices this year, and noted that platforms like Microsoft’s HoloLens and the Google-backed Magic Leap have been ramping up with engineering talent and funding for their mixed reality devices. “You’re starting to see a lot of companies spending a lot of money at this new world coming at us,” he said. And while relatively clumsy technology of the past has given mixed reality a bit of a bad rep — anyone remember Google Glass? — Scoble said upcoming technology will be mind-blowingly realistic and easy to use. “These glasses that are coming put virtual stuff on top of the real world. The Google Glass didn’t do that, and that’s part of the problem with Google Glass. The night I got them home, my wife said ‘Oh, do these show me anything about the people I’m going to meet?’ Because that’s the expectation, that it’s going to overlay information about things, and people that you are looking at. And the [new] glasses will do that,” he said. Listen to the podcast above to hear our full conversation with Scoble, or download the podcast as an MP3. Keep reading for an edited transcript of the interview.  Robert Scoble. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) Todd Bishop: So this book is called ” The Fourth Transformation.”  What were the first three briefly, and then, what is the fourth and how is it going to change the world? Scoble: For me, this is the fourth transformation of our personal computer age. Right? We started out in our journey down this path, if you are old enough, on an apple 2, with a character mode interface. And you would have to type commands to talk to the computer and make the computer do something. DOS is another example of this. And then the second transformation was when we went to GUI when the Macintosh came out in 89 and we used a mouse to click on icons. And the third one is mobile phones, particularly when we went to touch, the iPhone. And, that meant you’re carrying the computer with you and you are touching it. And we wrote a book called “Age of Context” about that world. And this one is mixed reality, or next generation augmented reality, where you are going to wear some glasses, so it’s going to overlay the interface on top of the real world. So you can use your hands, your eyes, your voice to control the computer. And that let’s you do all sorts of weird things like, virtual reality. Bishop: So you and Shel make some very bold claims about this in the book, and I think people have been been somewhat — they have been somewhat skeptical of this since Google Glass did not do as well as many people thought. Scoble: Yep. Bishop: But you’re saying, that eventually. It may take a couple decades, but eventually people will be turning to their glasses and experiencing a world. Scoble: I don’t think it’s two decades either. Bishop: So, increasingly they will be doing things through their glasses instead of their phones. Defend that case, because I think there are some skeptics out there. Scoble: Well, it’s hard to get the future when you haven’t seen it yet. And fortunately I have been going around R&D labs and companies like Lumus who’s making new kinds of optics and understanding where theses glasses are coming from. And I have interviewed the founder of PrimeSense that Apple bought out. Scoble: Let’s talk about apple, because I think that will take this conversation into a an interesting world. I believe in June, Apple going to announce more new technology than it has ever announced in it’s history. Bishop: Okay, so first off. Why June? WWDC, World Wide Developers Conference?  It’s hard to get the future when you haven’t seen it yet.Scoble: No, they are opening a new headquarters, which is a massive headquarters. It’s the most modern building in the world. It was built — designed and built with more technology than any other building, from what the people who built it told me. And they said when you walk in, you are going to be able to control ever room by using gestures. So every room has a 3D sensor in it. Every room is set up for next reality. So that’s the fist. Right? So they are going to bring us to that new headquarters in June or September, because they are already moving into it. And it’s going to be mostly one in June, and completely done in September. In June you are going to get invited to this new building first. Second, it’s the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, of receiving an iPhone. And, there is a lesson in their by the way. Because the first Iphone release was announced in January and we didn’t get it until June. And that will be the case with these products. They are keeping them very secretive because they don’t want pictures of these things leaking. And it’ll be apparent why in a second. So and along with that, they’re going to announce a new iPad, three new iPhones, a new TV product, a new watch, a new 3D map, a new Siri. And new glasses, all concerning augmented reality. And Tim Cook has been signaling to this for — since last June. And every week he has been in the press talking about how important augmented reality is to the world. And he is signaling that a big thing is coming. He has spent more that 10 billion dollars doing this, and spent 7 years of his life doing this. So, what is coming this year is going to be a massive deal. And that is going to wake everybody up. And then we are going to see: is the Hololens better than the Apple one? Is the Magic Leap better than the Apple one? Is the Facebook one better than the Apple one? Is the Snap one better than the Apple one? Bishop: So you think that Apple is going to be much as it was with the iPhone, the pace setter in the new world of mixed reality. Scoble: Yes. Yes. Bishop: Wow. Taylor Soper: And you think it’s going to be glasses that they are going to announce. Scoble: Well they are going to show a clear iPhone. So the three iPhones going to do mixed reality. They all have a 3D sensor from Primesense, they have 600 engineers in Tel Aviv working on that sensor. And four years ago when I saw that sensor it could tell how hard I was pressing on a table from three feet away. That’s how detailed it is, right. And you’re going to see a whole new realm of AI. Because that sensor is going to see stuff on your table in front of you, separate it into objects and then start looking things up. So, you can make Skrillex come out of this La Croix can and give a performance right on your table. I mean that’s where we’re going over the next decade. We’ll see how much of that arrives this year. But I think a lot of it is going to arrive this year, because it’s not just Apple. It’s Microsoft, it has 1800 people working on Hololens and it’s betting their whole company on the user interface of mixed reality. Snap is making many, many hires, right? Google just bought a company called Eyefluence which is in the book, for eye tracking and glasses, that tells me Google is building glasses that are separate from Magic Leap, which they also invested half a billion dollars in, right? And so, boom, boom, boom, boom. You’re starting to see a lot of companies spending a lot of money at this new world coming at us. Bishop: So, what do you say to the skeptics who say, ‘hey look, yes all these companies are making these bets, but in the end users are not going to want to immerse themselves in a whole other world’? Or these point clouds, as you talk about in the book. I think for people, it’s a bit of a leap for them to think about immersing themselves in alternate realities. What do you say to those skeptics? Scoble: Well, the market place is spending hundreds of billions of dollars to bring these things to you, and they will have some real advantages. Forget all the holographic stuff that Hololens is doing. Just getting as many screens around you as you want. So, let’s say you are a financial trader. Right now you are working in front of five screens cost? So, now you are talking about 2500 for five monitors around you. Well, what if you want to do that while you are walking around, or on a subway, or at a beach or at a party? Well, now you can wear those Apple glasses and get those same five monitors around you and be running your business on matter where you are. Bishop: So there is this company called Envelop VR, that had that exact plan. They shut down, they couldn’t make it. So doesn’t that speak to the fact that — Soper: But they aren’t Apple. Bishop: They’re not Apple, Okay.  I predict within three years I’m not using a phone very often. I’m using mostly glasses because with glasses you get as many virtual monitors as you want.Scoble: They’re not Apple, and these glasses I’m expecting are going to cost less than 500 dollars and they are going to be two ounces, and that’s a real important factor. Some where around two ounces. I’m seeing lots of glasses that are about four ounces that will get announced this year, with lenses from Lumus and from Vuzix and other places. But those are all stuff contained. Apple, I’m hearing, is going to put all that stuff down in the phone in your pocket or in your purse and you are going to wear glasses that have very little compute power on them, to make them really light and make the batteries on them really small, but last a long time. And so, we are going to see differing philosophies, right? Microsoft Holo ones might go in a little bit different direction. Magic Leap will go in a completely different direction, and then we’ll see, we’ll see. Bishop: So I know there is tons to talk about. What do you get most excited about, what’s on your mind on this topic? Scoble: You know at CES — I just came back from CES and Sundance to study this new world — and I saw these Lumus lenses. Now Lumus is a little start up nobody has ever heard of from Israel, and all they make is optics. I’m showing you a pair on my phone right next to the Snap Spectacles. Now, Snap Spectacles don’t have any screens in them, and the Lumus lenses in them have a 720p monitor on these lenses and they’re the same size. Which is why I believe this stuff is happening this year. It’s not just coming from Apple it’s coming from all sorts of places. Bishop: So it’s a tiny display embedded in the glasses and of course when it is that close up it looks like it’s actually big. You know there was a company, I think they might still be around, that did this on contact lenses too. Scoble: Yeah, those are farther away. Bishop: Yeah. Scoble: People ask me that all the time — when are we going to get contact lenses, or when are we going get brain jacking in. I mean, if you are blind you are already getting brain jacking in. It cost $150,000 to have surgery like that. And it comes with some downsides, because you are going to touch the optic nerve. And if they do that wrong well, it’ll screw stuff up, but if you’re already blind you are willing to take those risks because you are going to get sight maybe where you don’t have any sight today. And those techniques will lead down the path to figuring out how to jack in for far less money. But, that’s down. Bishop: Down the road. Scoble: It’s like 15, 20, 25 years. I can’t see that far. We all know it’s coming. But, you know — when? But the next decade is going to be about glasses. I don’t see how you’re going to do anything other than glasses in a mass market way anytime soon. Soper: I’m think I’m still one of the skeptics. Let’s talk about Google Glass little bit, because we were talking about this last night. And you’ve tried the Google Glass. There is a famous picture of you in the shower with them. Scoble: Yeah. Soper: What was wrong about those, both from maybe hardware and software and why is it different now with all these other new specs? Scoble: First of all, what’s coming on the market is completely different than Google Glass. Google Glass was just a little small screen up on the corner of your eye that would show you notifications, like you know, take a left turn on this corner. Or, hey your wife just wrote you on Facebook messenger. Real lightweight, not what we are talking about. What we are talking about mixed reality is you’re going to be having Aliens coming out from your walls. That all ready happens with my Hololens. Bishop: That happens every night at my house. Scoble: Well, you know. Bishop: Or is that — that’s something else though. Scoble: You know, it is legal in Seattle!  The next decade is going to be about glasses. I don’t see how you’re going to do anything other than glasses in a mass market way anytime soon.Scoble: These glasses that are coming put virtual stuff on top of the real world. The Google Glass didn’t do that, and that’s part of the problem with Google Glass. The night I got them home, my wife said ” oh, do these show me anything about the people I’m going to meet?’ Because that’s the expectation, that it’s going to overlay information about things, and people that you are looking at. And the glasses will do that, that are coming out, but not Google Glass. And then Google Glass just was early. The batter life only lasted 45 minutes. The camera on it was compressing in software, so it was blurry. It wasn’t as sharp as a GoPro for instance — blah, blah, blah. Those problems are all going away at some level, or they are going to be avoided. I keep hearing rumors that the Apple glasses have no camera in them other than the 3D sensor, which is a form of a camera. But, we’ll see, you know. Because Apples trying to avoid the privacy problems with these, Right? So we’ll see there is going to be different philosophies. Snap is going to put two cameras in these things and give you 3D. Bishop: What do you think about Snap, because I think a lot of folks, and of course for people who don’t know this is the parent of SnapChat. They have rebranded themselves as basically a camera company. Which seems a little dubious to me, but do you think — are they a legitimate player in this space? Because it seems like a novelty. Scoble: The glasses are the best way to create media for snaps. So if you care about looking cool to 20 year olds, you are going to be getting this. Bishop: Not really. Scoble: Well you don’t care, but there’s a lot of people out there who do care. There’s a lot of brands who want to meet 20 year olds and talk them into using their toothpaste and stuff like that. Bishop: I care about 20 year old GeekWire readers. Scoble: Well, there you go. Bishop: And should-be GeekWire readers.  The glasses are the best way to create media for snaps. So if you care about looking cool to 20 year olds, you are going to be getting this.Scoble: So, most of those people are on Snap or Instagram, instead of Facebook or Twitter. So if we want to reach them, we have to start channels and media properties for them. And if you’re going to do that, then you are probably going to get a pair of Snap Glasses because they are going to create the best media for that channel. And that’s a great way to look at it: that’s the camera for that channel. And if you want to use Facebook, you are going to use a different channel. Bishop: Yeah, well, that’s interesting — do you see a place for smartphones in this new world? Because you know a lot of the initial VR experiences are smart phone based, you just put it in the headset. Scoble: I predict within three years I’m not using a phone very often. I’m using mostly glasses because with glasses you get as many virtual monitors as you want. At home I have five monitors sitting on my desk — virtual monitors that look real — when I am wearing the glasses they look like real monitors, they are real monitors. Bishop: What are you using a Vive or something? Scoble: Hololens. Bishop: Like a developer edition. Scoble: Yeah I have it right here. They say it’s a developer edition, it’s just too expensive for consumers. Scoble: And too heavy and too dorky, right. Great for the GeekWire. Bishop: It’s perfect. Scoble: It’s perfect right, everybody who has a Hololens marks themselves as a geek right now. But soon those big things are going to be small. And then, we find out where the fun is really. Because I’ll wear a really light weight pair of glasses a long time. Hololens is really hard to wear for longer than an hour. Soper: The form factors still bugs me. At the dinner, we were at this VR dinner last night and two people brought out their Snap Spectacles and they are these sunglasses and they took, you know video of each other. But for me, I don’t want to have to bring my glasses or put on glasses when I’m at dinner, I just want to enjoy it, or use my smartphone to do some things. Scoble: Let’s talk about the game. Because I just spoke to the sports teams. Soper: Yeah, this is interesting. Scoble: And they are already putting sensors around the stadium to track every player in real-time. And you are going to wear the glasses and you are going to look at, you know, who’s your favorite player? Soper: Damian Lillard, on the Blazers. Scoble: All right, so you are going to have a look at Damiam Lillard, and as he is doing his sport you are going to see stats on top of him, how fast is he running. If he gets hit, how hard was that hit, you know. We can predict even by the time the ball leaves his hand, is that shot going to be made, right? Because we already have missiles — technology to figure out whether a missile’s going to hit anything right, before we shoot it down and spend half a million dollars. Bishop: I think only Steph Curry’s shots can be qualified as missiles.  I keep hearing rumors that the Apple glasses have no camera in them other than the 3D sensor… because Apples trying to avoid the privacy problems with these.Scoble: Well, in football there putting a sensor in the ball it’s self to watch its spin rate as it leaves the quarterbacks hands. I mean, that’s what is about to happen. So you are going to wear these glasses while going to NASCAR, going to a football game, to see a football game in much better detail. Plus you are going to be able to say, you know what, I’m tired of these bleacher seats. Because that’s all I can afford. So, can I click on Bill Gates’s glasses and see it from his point of view?  Possibly. And certainly, if there is a Nokia 360 camera next to him, you can choose that camera and sit next to Bill Gates for a while. Bishop: So, one company that has not yet come up — which I am surprised by, because the last time you stopped by here they were maybe first on your list — Amazon. Where are they in this world? Scoble: They are working on it. They’re not — Bishop: Do you know things? Scoble: Yeah, I mean, I know people — Bishop: We have ways, Robert. Scoble: I know people who are working on it. And it’s too big of a deal for Amazon to ignore anyways, because this is going to change shopping malls and shopping. An their competition is working on it, so of course Amazon is working on it, not to mention they have some real advantages in this world. Because we are already buying everything off of Amazon. My book is published by Amazon so. Soper: Well you mentioned yesterday, if I had my glasses now and I’m looking at your book here, looking at your jacket, I could just instantly buy it. Just by looking at it. I’m sure Amazon is thinking that, right? Scoble: Yeah. And that exact thing was show to me by the founder of Eyefluence who got sold to Google. So we’ll see what Amazon is up to. Amazon doesn’t need to move fast because we don’t have that expectation — that they are going to be the computer that we are going to use. We have that expectation with Google, with Android and Apple, with ISO. But Amazon could be a disruptor here. It will be fun to watch, how amazon comes into this market. Bishop: We’ll they’ve got Alexa, so it seems like there will be a natural confluence between voice technologies, machine learning, artificial intelligence and this new world of mixed reality. Scoble: Yeah. Bishop: So wouldn’t that give them a leg up in a inroad if they have that system?  If I had my glasses now and I’m looking at your book here, looking at your jacket, I could just instantly buy it. Just by looking at it.Scoble: It could, and they have a lot of media, as well. Which you are going to want to play in this new world, because this is going to be how you watch TV. This is personalized TV, right? When you are wearing two or four ounce glasses only you see what you’re watching, and you get as big a screen as you want. So why am I watching a 60 inch screen over in the corner. Why don’t I just grab it with my hands, make it bigger and put the screen where ever I want to around me. And that’s what’s coming with mixed reality. You know, that’s why the TV product is going to be interesting. Because you are going to have to buy the new TV, the new iPad, the new iPhone, the new watch and the new glasses. This is $3000 worth of Apple stuff coming at us. Bishop: Well maybe you don’t actually have to get the new TV, maybe you can take that out of the equation. Scoble: No, you’re still, your going to want the TV box because it has the PrimeSense sensor on it. Now why do you want a 3D sensor on your TV or sitting next to your TV? Because it can aim at your body and now you can do full body VR. You can do kick boxing or yoga or anything that requires you to use your legs and your hands. Right now, all the VR tools use only hands, so that HTC Vibe that I have in my house or Oculus rift they have sensors that watch your headset and your hands and know where those things are in space. But, coming soon, where are you going to get full body VR. Bishop: As you are describing it seems like Kinect was kind of the equivalent of the black and white era, in a lot of ways. Scoble: And where did Kinect come from? It was licensed from PrimeSense. Bishop: PrimeSense, that’s right. Scoble: Which Apple bought. Bishop: Although Microsoft would — the people who were on that team with Alex Kipman would get into a knock down drag out argument with you over that. Scoble: I know. But you know what, they did license their technology from PrimeSense. Bishop: They did, yes. Yes. Soper: Yeah, I’m curious — Robert, obviously you are somewhat excited for this future, but are you worried about anything? Are you scared? Or are you just supper psyched about it? Bishop: Have you met this man? Scoble: Battery life. Soper: Battery life? Scoble: I’m worried about battery life, because these batteries are going to be really small and the processors are really small — everything is really small. Bishop: Wireless charging. Scoble: Wireless charging is going to be a big part of this, right? And I hear Apple has some cool stuff coming, some next generation wireless charging. We’ll see if it shows up. Bishop: Nathan Myhrvold and Intellectual Ventures, they showed how to do this last week with meta materials, it’s one of their new things to check out. Scoble: There we go. So I keep hearing this kind of stuff. That wireless charging is coming. Broadcom at CES for two years now has been showing me wireless charging pads, where you can hold a watch or a phone over it, and even a foot away from it and it will still charge. So, I hear there are newer technology than that coming. So we’ll see. Bishop: But to Taylor’s point, privacy and loss of human connection would be two of the top concerns people would have. Scoble: You mean dressing up the SpongeBob is a little weird? Bishop: Wait, I’m sorry what did I miss? Scoble: Because with next reality I can do anything visual that you can dream up. Anything! Soper: Is that good or bad? Bishop: At that point I’m not going to want to be experience the real world if I can make the virtual world anything I want. Scoble: Well, first of all the AR world is the, their is stuff on top of the real world, so you are getting mixture, this is why I call it mixed reality. Bishop: Yeah, you guys use that phrase, MR is the phrase you use. Scoble: And, whether it gets call that at Apple we’ll see. I doubt it. Apple will come up with some trade markable — Bishop: iWorld. Robert Scoble, wearing his developer edition HoloLens. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) Scoble: Yeah, Apple world, you know. But there is a lot of truth to that. We should talk about these new 3D maps that are coming out. But in my Holo’s I play a game called fragments. Where you map out your room with the glasses and then it puts murder in your room and you have to solve the murder with clues that are on all the walls. And there are even little virtual rats that run around your feet. And it is freaky as hell. But this shows, when you get mixed reality, you are going to mix reality. Some things are going to be virtual and some things are going to be physical, and in 10 years it’s going to be really hard to tell the difference. Maybe less, right? Bishop: Because even the physical objects will have IP addresses, they will be kind of natural citizens of the virtual world. Scoble: Not to mention, think about what the marketers are going do with this. You are going to walk into a hotel and see an augmented hotel. You are going to see a coke can that’s augmented, and Skrillex is going to pop out of the coke can and give a performance right in front of you and then jump back into the coke can. Your car companies are all thinking about this. Mercedes Benz is already thinking about giving you a pair of mixed reality glasses in the glove compartment so that when you blow out the tire you are going to put on the glasses and its going to show you how to change the tire step by step. And it’s going to watch you to make sure you did your work properly. Did you turn the lug nuts hard enough, and enough turns. And it can watch that, and it can give you Pokemon points when you do it right, if they wanted to. Bishop: So if you look at it this way in terms of people creating their own reality. Frankly, our President is decades ahead. Scoble: Oh, absolutely. Bishop: Just fashioning his own environment. Scoble: Why do you think I am so into VR? Because VR solves both physical and emotional pain. And it’s really hard to get into one of the creations I saw at Sundance and think about work, or think about troubles with your family, or think about politics. It’s really hard, it why we all go skiing and snowboarding, or surfing. Because in those activities your in a high flow state activity, and it’s really hard to focus on your troubles. And VR is permanent skiing. It’s fun. Soper: Permanent skiing, I like that.  Why do you think I am so into VR? Because VR solves both physical and emotional pain.Scoble: Yeah. Because you’re shooting your friend in paintball and you’re forgetting your troubles. This is why I got into VR. Anyways, at Bowing, up the street, they have hundreds of HoloLenses and they are teaching people how to fix jet engines with these things. This is the best education technology humans have ever invented, and it teaches you in real time when your doing something, and it’s not — you don’t have to go to a classroom for a week anymore. You just go, they give you the glasses, you go to work. And it shows you — on top of the jet engine — the steps that you need to take to fix that Jet engine. And it checks your work as you are doing, so it makes sure that you screwed that screw in properly and it won’t fall out in the middle of the air, right. Bishop: One of my favorite HoloLens demos early on was the electrician demon, or the plumber demo, where the plumber is sitting at his or her office scrolling on a tablet, the consumer in the home has a HoloLens on and is literally seeing, annotated in front of them, how to fix the plumbing. Based on what the plumber is doing. To your point, I mean, there is lots of different business applications here too. Scoble: Absolutely. Disney’s new theme park in Shanghai, China. I’ve been to it, it’s beautiful. It was all built in VR. Fords new cars, you go to their R&D labs, they use VR to build cars now. They don’t build clay models anymore as often, because they are really expensive. And if you want to change the fender design on a clay model it takes you a week to re-shave the fender. Now it takes you a few seconds on, in VR. You just aim at it and you change the shape. Bishop: So you’re saying, basically, that the benefits are going out weigh any negatives. Scoble: Yeah. By far, on this one. And that’s why I know that this is going to happen fast. When people get their HoloLens on their face and realize just what mixed reality does for them, they just are floored. My son calls it his super power. Soper: And you think, speaking of Hololens, earlier you talking about how Satya, CEO of Microsoft is betting, you said something like betting the whole company’s future on Hololens? Scoble: Yeah, when I was at Gitech, all you saw on the front door was Microsoft Hololens. They are betting a lot on it. Because they know this user interface is going to be usable by a lot more people, even illiterate people can use mixed reality because it works the same way as the real world works. As a two year old you learn to pick up a can or a pencil very early in life, and that’s the skill you need to work in VR or AR.  It’s zero instruction learning, I saw a little four year old come into my house, just pick up the headset, the HTC Vibe headset and the controllers and went to town without anybody telling her what to do. She knew how it worked because that’s how the real world works. Bishop: If you were somebody who was just wanting to get into virtual reality, which device would you pick? Scoble: Today? Bishop: Yeah, today.  Even illiterate people can use mixed reality because it works the same way as the real world works.Scoble: I would probably point them to the HTC Vibe, because it has the best room scale technology, where it defines the little box that you can walk around in. And the games are — the experiences on HTV Vibe are more mature. Than on the Sony play station VR or on the Oculus Rift. Now Oculus, it’s tough one. Six months ago I would have been very strong, you have to go HTC. Now I’m not to sure, because the touch controllers on Oculus are nicer than on the controllers on the HTC Vibe. But HTC has new controllers come out so, it’s a war right now. So you wait six months and everything about this market is changed. And certainly, when Apple comes in the market it’s going to do most or much of what a HTC Vibe does, because it’s going to do full six-degrees-of-freedom VR, as well as mixed reality. So, it’s going to be a fun year to see how all these companies compete with each other. I think HTC is fine, by the way. Even if Apple is very, very successful. Because I think HTC is going to be the choice for putting in a lot of these VR arcades. And in China alone, I hear there is already 1000 VR arcades, where you can go in and rent some time on a HTC Vibe or Oculus Rift and play with your friends, right. Bishop: Now Microsoft has windows holographic which essentially extends the technology that’s in the Hololens to third party devices. Speaking very generally there. Scoble: Yep. Bishop: And they are coming out with third party devices this year, some of their partners. Will Windows be the dominate underlining OS here? How does that work? Scoble: As much as I love my HoloLens — I think Microsoft has been doing the best work — They’re still swimming upstream. Everybody in the world has an android or an iPhone in their pocket, and how is Microsoft going to get your to buy a 1000 dollar thing on top of that? That’s really hard. I don’t understand how they are going to get there. But, they were first into this new space. And I expect a new 2.0 Hololens and I expect major improvements. And we’ll see, it’s going to be a war over these things. And I don’t know how it plays out. You know, we haven’t seen the players yet. As much as I know about what Apple is coming out with, I have no idea how good their artificial intelligence is. I expect it to be mind blowing because they have 600 people working on it. But I don’t know. You know, there’s a lot of if’s. And, I don’t know how good Microsoft is. Clearly the first one was pretty good. That was a pretty good first attempt in a new field. But they need to improve that a lot to be a mass market consumer product and one that will steal the users away from Google and Apple. Right, that’s a hard thing. Bishop: Taylor I know you probably have more to ask, but I always get sentimental when you come in Robert, because you were the subject of one of my first ever front page stories at the Seattle PI. Do you remember this? Scoble: Barely, but yeah I do. Bishop: I’ve got it right here, look at yourself. I’ll link to this from the show notes. It was 2003, July. Soper: Looking good Robert, looking good. Bishop: Yeah, you’re looking good. You actually, you’ve lost a lot of weight. Scoble: Yeah, I’ve lost 50 pounds the last two years. Bishop: Yeah, you really have. Anyway, the headline was ” All the new kids on the blog”. It was when there was all this excitement and surprise that all the Microsoft employees were finally speaking publicly. On their blogs. So, at any rate I’ll link to that. Scoble: We changed a lot about how PR worked, and how these companies had to build social teams. And now, those teams have been — are part of the companies. Every company has a social team, if they don’t they’re screwing up. Soper: One thing I wanted to ask was, I think I’m thinking about unity and you mentioned all the employees now working on these technologies. And I think a piece of advice, I think you mentioned this earlier, was go study that because you will get a job, right, if you know how to do that. I’m thinking about the whole new world. Scoble: Unity people are going to be in short supply because every brand is going to need to virtualize. When we visited Sephora, a big cosmetic retailer, they already have augmented reality makeup, and you can already try it on your iPhone. So you get the Sephora app, aim it at your face, try out some pink lipstick on your face. And the product that you experience on your iPhone is color matched to the physical product. So that took a lot of work. And they’re building — they’re thinking about this mixed reality world where Apple and other people are going to walk into their stores and want to experience the store in a different way. So they are thinking about it, and they are already augmenting signs when you walk into the store with your phone. So they are already thinking about when you are walking in the store with your glasses on, and you have this Sephora app, you can try all sorts of stuff without putting on your skin. Soper: And this is just Sephora, and we mentioned sports teams. I mean, it’s everywhere. Scoble: Yeah that’s why we say it’s going to change everything. When we started doing the kind of work — visiting companies and really thinking this through — it’s like, what happens if Apple really does sell glasses to every iPhone user? You know, last quarter alone they sold 78 million of these iPhone 7’s and 7 Pluses, and this is a product that’s really not that inspired. It’s iterative. You know, compared to a 6S, it has a little better camera. Okay, great. Is that really a reason to buy a new phone? But they sold 78 million anyways. Imagine next year when they have really amazing new technologies and products. How many people are going to buy it — 100 million, 150 million, 200 million? I don’t think they are even going to be able to build enough. That’s going to be a problem for Apple, right. So, I think he just opened a factory in India for that reason. If he really is going to expand the market noticeably in the next three years, he’s going to have to build a lot of product. Bishop: So, when you are talking Apple, are you basing this on public clues or inside knowledge?  Watch with the self-driving industry does with mixed reality, because the technologies are very, very similar.Scoble: Both. When you visit so many R&D labs, and have so many relationships with people high up in the consumer electronics industry, you find out stuff. And I’ve interviewed the founder of PrimeSense and the founder and the CTO of Metaio back in 2011 which lead to this book. And those companies got bought by Apple. See, if you go back to those interview, they tell you what they are going to do with their lives. And I assume they are going to give it to us this year. Back in 2011, the Metaio CTO showed me monsters on the sides of skyscrapers. He took us outside and he said look, we can put monsters on the sides of buildings. So now when I get these glasses I’m expecting to blow up the entire city with aliens. And it will be viewed from your position. So, if you are behind a building you will see it properly occluded. And if he doesn’t do that Magic Leap is going to do that, or Hololens is going to do that. Because I already have aliens coming out of my walls with my Hololens, so what’s next for entertainment? A lot. In fact, I just had dinner with Ted Schilowitz the futurist at 20th Century Fox, the movie company. And he’s very bullish on this technology. He said this is a huge deal for the entertainment industry, because we are going to be able to see a huge screen in front of us, even while sitting in the coach section of a plane, or taking the light rail to the airport. Now, all of sudden we can watch a movie in the same glory you would watch it in a movie theater. Bishop: What’s this going to mean for sex? Scoble: Oh, you had to go there didn’t you. Soper: That’s a whole other show. Sex robots in augmentation, yeah. Scoble: I think it will change deeply, because my wife will be able to dress me up as Brad Pitt. Bishop: Enough said. Robert Scoble! Thanks for joining us this week on the podcast! Oh, that’s good. Any other big areas that you would cover? Scoble: Watch with the self-driving industry does with mixed reality, because the technologies are very, very similar. The LiDARs are focusable on the newer stuff that’s coming a long, from companies like Quanergy. There’s a new AI engine in soft driving cars coming from a company called DeepScale and others. And there is a new 3D map coming from a company called Luminar Technologies, who also is building sensors for the front bumper. And these are all stealth mode companies, you haven’t seen their products yet. But they are coming. And they work very similarly to these mixed reality glasses which have a sensor on them that see’s the world in 3D. It has an artificial intelligence brain and it’s going to need a 3D map. Because when you walk into a certain room at the Ritz ,it’s going to know it’s in that room, because every room is different. If you think about it, I’ve been paying attention to this now for more than a year, I’ve never been in a room that’s exactly the same. Even in a hotel, where the rooms are pretty much the same, but each room has something slightly different from any other room in the world. So if your glasses can see those difference — and they will, it will know exactly that you are in room 318 at the Ritz right now, and you are looking out toward the window — and so it can do stuff with all those surfaces and put Mick Jagger in your hotel room if you want to. Bishop: Hey, before you go. You’ve been sitting here this whole time with this sort of amulet around your neck. And it’s been flashing with little LED’s I guess? What is this thing? Scoble: It’s geek jewelry I call it. Zackery Vor, he’s an artist and entrepreneur in San Francisco is making this little geek jewelry. Bishop: So it’s for show, it’s not actually doing anything? Scoble: It’s not doing anything but he’s building one that will react to sound. So if you are at a rave or at a nightclub it will be doing fun stuff with LED’s. Yeah, it’s burning man art basically.  This is the best education technology humans have ever invented. Bishop: All right, so let’s turn this over to the audience. We’re going to be turning this over to the audience, we’re going to give away a copy, a signed copy of The Fourth Transformation by Scoble and Shel Isreal. What I am going to ask you to do is send an e-mail to contest@geekwire.com and describe the application of mixed reality that you are most looking forward to in the future. You can say sex if you want, you can say you’re going to look like Brad Pitt, too. But if there’s other things that you want to talk about I want to hear that instead. Once again, send your e-mail to contest@geekwire.com, describe the application of mixed reality that you are most excited about in the future and from the answer, and from the responses we’ll pick one person at random to win a copy. Scoble: I’ll give you one that I want and Microsoft has already showed it to us. I want to say “hey Cortana” — if I am using the Microsoft classes — show me the Hubble telescope view on the sky. Because I can never see the sky because we have light pollution in most modern cities. And we have you know, lots of other pollution. And Microsoft has this thing called the World Wide Telescope, where they have 30 different telescopes and you can go from, you know, from the Hubble telescope view to the Keck telescope view. And I want to see that on top of the sky when I’m outside with my kids and I want to show them the universe the way the Hubble sees it, not the way my eyes sees it. Bishop: So when the ozone layer is gone we can just re-create it virtually is what you are saying. Scoble: Yeah, you know we’ll just put snow on the mountains again, and we’ll put, you know. Bishop: Sorry, I didn’t mean to end it on a downer there. Soper: I’ve got nothing there. Brad Pitt and sex, I’m still thinking about that. Scoble: But seriously, you hit on something. This is the best education technology humans have ever invented. So if we can show people the universe, we can maybe get them to start thinking about things other than just protecting the United States. That’ll take America back forward again, instead of going backwards as we currently are.

Problem is, AMP pages are saddled with strange URLs that are different from the source article, which makes them a bit of a pain to share. Google is finally addressing that issue. AMP articles use less data and load much more quickly than visiting a website through a traditional method, but as Google explains in its blog, doing so requires some technical trickery that basically mean the posts have three separate types of URLs (in addition the original, non-AMP one). For example, you might have noticed that when trying to share an article from Google, the URL will often begin with “google.com/amp/” before the actual URL. “The most awesome stage” Last year, Facebook's VP of Design thought the TNW Conference main stage was the best she'd ever been on. FIND OUT WHY While not a huge deal – sharing the URL still works just as well as before – it’s a sloppy implementation. And if a shared link is opened on an AMP-compatible device, it will include the header bar, which looks totally out of place and takes up unnecessary space for users who didn’t open up the article from Google. (We have to copy and paste links from Google all the time here at TNW; having to remove the AMP portion of the URL gets annoying fast.) Google’s solution is a simple link button that displays the original URL. You can then long-tap on the link to share it as easily as ever. This feature is beginning to roll out today. In the coming weeks, the Google app on Android will also now share the original, non-AMP URL when a user taps the share button (this is already the case on iOS), and Google is look into ways it can make sure the original URL is being shared on any platform AMP is viewed. You might have to retrain your muscle memory to stop copy and pasting from the URL bar, but the new button is a simple fix that should make sharing articles a bit of neater experience. It’s a bit surprising it took this long – Facebook has had a ‘share’ button since the outset of Instant Articles – but better late than never.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google may be combining YouTube Music, Google Play Music teams By Ida Torres - February 10, 2017 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you’re confused as to why Google has two music streaming apps, specifically YouTube Music and Google Play Music, the tech giant may be rethinking that strategy too. Sources are saying that the company is working on combining the two units, which includes the two product teams as well. There is no official news as to what this will mean for consumers moving forward but we probably should expect some form of change soon and hopefully, it’s a change that will be better for consumers as well. Google Play Music has of course been around for some time now and is Google’s official music streaming and selling app. But eventually, they also decided to have YouTube Music, as part of their strategy to create dedicated apps for three of the video sharing apps’ most popular verticals, which also includes kids and gaming. It’s supposedly to optimize users’ experience, depending on what they really want to use YouTube for. Now that the product teams for the two will supposedly be merging, can we expect just one music streaming app from Google? Nothing is official and certain at this point, so it seems that the two different products will continue on as they are now and be independent of each other. But of course, eventually, we will be seeing changes or even an integration. Consumers seem to be on a minimalist trend when it comes to having apps on their phones. We’re seeing users either stop downloading new apps or remove ones that they’re not using that often. So it might be a good move for Google to just have one music app. Besides, competition is tough on music streaming apps nowadays so it might be better to combine their powers.

When a customer uses the internet to research products or services, they're not just looking for any business—they're looking for a business in their neighborhood or city. You want to make sure your business is at the top of those local search results. Fill out your Google My Business page. One of the simplest yet most effective ways to boost your local search ranking is to register with Google My Business. To get the most out of the listing, fill out all the fields, including your address, phone number and business hours. Build consistent Name, Address and phone number (NAP). When Google crawls the web for search results, it looks for mentions of your business' name, address and phone number (NAP). Even slight variations, like an abbreviated street address, can confuse Google, so it's important to make sure that your NAP is consistent in every citation, on or off your website. Claim online listings. Online business listings are an important part of local search engine optimization. Creating links that lead back your website, in conjunction with consistent NAP citations, raises your business' online visibility and signals to Google that your website is relevant and trustworthy. Get off-site backlinks. Online business listings aren't the only way to get links. Encourage other websites, including local media and bloggers, to link to your website by getting out into the community. Winston Rowe & Associates provides their prospective clients a free business review website to help them promote their business. Localize landing pages. Don't just list your business' name in the title and content of your homepage; include the city you operate in as well. Use long-tail keywords. Use keywords to target niche markets. This strategy not only helps customers find your specific service, it also helps you rank higher because your website is using less-competitive search terms Build a mobile-friendly website. Thanks to the ever-increasing number of searches on mobile devices, Google changed its algorithm to privilege mobile-friendly websites in its results. If you want to boost your local search ranking, your website needs to look good on smartphones and tablets as well as desktop computers. Start by running your website through Google's mobile friendly test. Respond to reviews. When customers leave reviews on Google or any other website, it helps boost your search ranking. You can encourage customers to go online and leave reviews, and if they do, it's important to respond gracefully to both positive and negative comments. This will help improve your reputation with searchers as well. Post local content. Providing extra value to customers with a blog, FAQ page and other local content also makes your website more attractive to search engines. If you're aiming to rank in local search results, remember to give your content a local spin by writing about topics relevant to your area.

Billy Steele, @wmsteele 16h ago in Personal Computing Comments 329 Shares Share Tweet Share Save To improve the Chromebook experience for users with visual impairments, Google announced a new version of its ChromeVox tool this week. First, the screen reading feature is now the default option on all Chromebooks running Chrome OS 56 and newer. All you have to do to turn it on is hit Ctrl + Alt + Z. As part of this update, Google says it made the ChromeVox keyboard controls easier to use. These commands are what help you navigate websites and other apps without a mouse. Those controls not only work on web pages, but they can also be used to access other parts of the UI -- like the Chromebook menu and status tray. Google has also made it easier to find and learn all of those handy commands thanks to new ChromeVox menus. Here, you can get a list of open tabs, ChromeVox options, speech options and a rundown of the key parts of a page -- things like links, headings or tables. That ChromeVox menu is accessible by pressing Search + Period or clicking an icon in the upper left corner. The new version of ChromeVox also allows users to use a braille display's keyboard to navigate around Chrome. Google says Chromebooks play nice with most USB braille displays, so this gives people with visual impairments another option. It also means they won't have to switch back and forth to the Chromebook keyboard to get around. There's also a new feature that allows teachers to follow along with text captions at the top of the Chromebook screen as students read on a braille display. Lastly, ChromeVox now has auditory features called "earcons." The tools give the user context when they arrive at something like a link or button and provide cues when a page is still loading and more. Earcons use stereo positioning to help the user understand where the information is on a page. This means that if you come to a button that's on the right side of the page, the earcon will play through the right speaker or headphones.

Google Chromebook laptops are impractical for many people because they’re little more than expensive paperweights when they’re out of range of an internet connection. Yet they’ve defied expectations and made tremendous inroads in one of the least likely places: U.S. schools. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK (AP) — The Google Chromebook, a type of stripped-down laptop, isn't a practical mobile device for many people — mostly because it basically turns into an expensive paperweight whenever it can't find a Wi-Fi connection. Yet Chromebooks have defied expectations and made major inroads in an unexpected environment — U.S. schools. In retrospect, that shouldn't be too surprising. Chromebooks are cheap and easy to manage, making them popular with budget-constrained schools with limited tech-support staff. And Wi-Fi is now common enough in U.S. schools and homes to make an internet-dependent device practical for students. Google doesn't want to stop there. It's releasing new models in partnership with Samsung that are designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers. They have several tablet-like features, including a stylus, touch controls and a 360-degree hinge that allows you to turn the screen faceup. One starts selling Sunday for $449; a more powerful version comes out in April for $100 more. Google and its manufacturing partners are trying to shed the Chromebook's perception as underperforming budget devices. But even with premium models, expanding beyond U.S. schools won't be easy. CHROMEBOOKS GET SCHOOLED For personal computers and tablets, Chromebook's share of the U.S. education market was 49 percent last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2013, according to IDC figures released this week. But education accounts for just 14 percent of the 110 million devices shipped in the U.S. last year — and Chromebooks make up just 9 percent of that broader total. Their numbers are also low abroad, even in schools. The Chromebook's popularity in U.S. education is also largely limited to grades K-12, analysts say. Macs and Windows laptops are still dominant on college campuses. ROUGH START Chromebooks use a lightweight operating system designed to get people online faster, without having to wait around for the computer to start up. Much of the heavy lifting on Chromebooks gets done on Google's remote servers, so Chromebooks themselves don't need fast chips or lots of storage. Early on, though, that made Chromebooks seem cheap and underpowered, which "soured consumer expectations right off the bat," IDC analyst Linn Huang said. Online storage for photos and documents online was much less common in 2011 when Chromebooks launched , so their limited local storage was initially unappealing. And the few apps available for Chromebooks didn't work offline, at least at the time. DIFFERING NEEDS But what constrains consumers can actually be liberating in education. Most kids don't need laptops on the bus or other locations where they can't connect to Wi-Fi. And they don't miss business software like Microsoft Office; Google's online apps for documents and spreadsheets do just fine for homework. "What surprised us was how quickly it took off in education," said Kan Liu, who oversees Chromebooks at Google. Apple's iPad was hot at the time, but Google sold the Chromebook on convenience. They're easier for classrooms to share; just sign in with a Google account, and a student's apps and documents instantly appear. Teachers also have online tools to lock down what apps and sites students can use. And with models available for less than $200, schools can get a few Chromebooks for the price of an iPad or a rival laptop. "It allows us to put more devices in students' hands," said Aaron Slutsky, chief technology officer for McDowell County Schools in North Carolina. FAR FROM UNIVERSAL But Chromebook's success story in schools is largely an American one, and it's likely to stay that way. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa notes that Chromebooks are useless in China because the device depends on Google services that aren't available there. And in emerging countries, where a budget laptop would be ideal, she said internet access isn't reliable enough. Even in the U.S., the iPad is better for many creative tasks such as recording and editing movies. Students studying engineering, robotics and graphics won't be able to use Chromebooks to run the kind of specialized software that's available for Macs and Windows laptops. "But that's not needed for 98 percent of our students," said Tracy Dabbs, coordinator of technology and innovation at the Burlington-Edison School District near Seattle. Many school districts limit Apple and Windows computers for the students who specifically need them, then provide Chromebooks for the rest. McDowell County, for instance, has 5,500 Chromebooks, 1,200 iPads — and only 100 Macs and 200 Windows PCs. RIVALS STAGE A COMEBACK Last year, Apple gave iPads in schools some Chromebook-like features unavailable to the general public. That includes ways to let multiple people use a single tablet and management tools for tech-support staff. A new Classroom app lets teachers control what apps students run and track their progress. Apple also provides classroom tools for teachers and students. Free e-books offer teachers step-by-step guides on using iPad apps and curriculum suggestions for everyday subjects. A separate app lets kids learn programming using the same language developers use to build iPad apps. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced last month new online apps and management tools for schools, along with Windows PCs priced similarly to Chromebooks. BEYOND SCHOOLS Huang said some businesses are giving Chromebooks a second look, especially in retail, banking and other settings where people share computers. But in many offices, the lack of business software such as Office is a major hurdle. Google's alternative lacks many advanced capabilities found in Office, and habits are hard to change. Google is trying to make Chromebooks more palatable by letting them run Android apps designed for phones and tablets. It's testing this capability on a handful of Chromebook models, including the new ones from Samsung. That makes it possible to install Office, Adobe Photoshop and many apps on a Chromebook, though these tablet versions have limited features compared with versions for Macs or Windows laptops.

SUBSCRIBE Here’s how Google’s own ads impact bids & pricing in AdWords auctions Google takes steps to minimize the impact of its ads on CPCs, but advertisers pay as if Google didn’t win its ad positions, not as if Google didn’t bid at all. Ginny Marvin on February 10, 2017 at 12:00 pm More Google and its sibling companies at Alphabet collectively bid on thousands of keywords in AdWords. That has been going on for years. The search giant has said its ad buying does not “directly inflate” pricing for other advertisers because “advertisers are charged as if it wasn’t bidding.” However, that’s not quite accurate. Participating in its own ad auctions has long raised conflict of interest objections. A report from The Wall Street Journal last month put a spotlight on the practice again with some eye-popping stats and renewed our questions about how these ads affect other advertisers. Analysis by SEMrush, in early December, featured in the WSJ report, found that ads for Google and its sister companies appeared in the top ad spot on Google search in 91 percent of 25,000 results for broad non-brand queries — like “laptops” and “phones” — related to the products. How do all those ads affect the CPCs Google customers pay in those auctions? From the The Wall Sreet Journal (bolding added): “Google said that when it competes for ads, other advertisers are charged as if it wasn’t bidding, meaning its participation doesn’t directly inflate prices. That is one of a series of house ad rules set by an internal Google committee designed to minimize conflict.” Let’s break that down and look at why that first sentence doesn’t paint the whole picture. How Google deals with pricing when it competes  The committee overseeing Google’s house ad rules determined that when a Google ad competes in an auction, the AdRank of its ads will be taken out of the mix before calculating the CPCs of the other advertisers. That’s what “advertisers are charged as if it wasn’t bidding” refers to. What it really means is advertisers are charged as if Google didn’t win its ad position. First, a quick refresher. AdRank is the quality score of an ad times the maximum price an advertiser is willing to pay for an ad click. AdRank is what informs the price an advertiser pays for an ad click. The basic CPC calculation is: AdRank of Advertiser Below You/Your Quality Score + $0.01 = Your CPC Because pricing is based in part on the AdRank of the next competitor, actual prices can vary pretty widely. A typical auction looks something like this: Based on conversations with Google and what we already know, this is how an AdWords auction works when Google (or another Alphabet company) advertises: Google enters the auction, essentially like any other advertiser. Just as with any other auction, all ad positions are based on the AdRank of each participant in the auction. The best AdRank gets the top position. The CPCs that advertisers end up paying are determined only after Google’s AdRank is taken out of the mix. For example, if Google wins position 2, then the advertiser in position 1 ends up paying just enough to have beaten the AdRank of the advertiser in position 3. Using the same information from the auction above, here’s an illustration of how CPCs are calculated when Google entered and won position 2. By skipping over Google’s AdRank and calculating Advertiser 1’s CPC based on the AdRank of Advertiser 2, the prices stay the same as when Google wasn’t participating in the first auction scenario above. This is why Google maintains that its participation doesn’t directly inflate prices. What happens when Google wins the auction? SEMrush found that Google was in the top ad position in 91 percent of the results it looked at. If we consider that data directional, the scenario above in which Google won the number two spot and not the first position, is less typical. When Google wins the auction, it is also technically true that its AdRank has no effect on the prices advertisers in the positions below pay. In fact, Google doesn’t factor into the pricing at all when it wins the top spot. The CPCs of the other advertisers aren’t affected by removing Google’s Ad Rank from the calculation. The advertiser in position 2 is already paying just over what it needed to beat out the Ad Rank of the advertiser in position 3 — assuming all the bids stay the same. But it’s an auction. Competition affects bidding in an auction. The simple scenarios above ignore the likelihood that advertisers — particularly those using any type of bid automation rules — will adjust bids in response to more competition entering the auction. As marketers told the WSJ, “[A]dvertising slots on many pages are limited, so Google’s ads can prompt others to increase their bids to compete with the remaining slots.” When Google scores the top ad position most of the time, the other advertisers are left to fight among themselves for the remaining slots. If the other advertisers raise their bids to fight for those top spots when Google comes into the mix, all of their CPCs will go up. Even if just one advertiser, Advertiser 3 in the example below, raises its bid to try to stay visible at the top of the page, everyone’s CPCs go up from where they were in Scenario 2. To be absolutely clear, the two scenarios above can happen whether it’s Google or some other high AdRank competitor in the mix. The difference in this case is that the competitor is both the auctioneer and the bidder. A lack of transparency There are also questions about how much Google really bids and how high its quality scores must be to keep winning the top spot so often. Per The Wall Street Journal’s report: “Google said that its ads only appear atop results because of the ad’s quality and the price Google is willing to pay. Google said its house ads are also subject to marketing budgets.” Google is saying its ads are treated just like everyone else’s in terms of quality scores and bids. Adding that their ad buying teams are beholden to marketing budgets is a way of saying its teams don’t just drastically outbid everyone. A Google spokesperson reiterated to Search Engine Land that internal teams are held accountable for their AdWords budgets like other marketers. Still, to outsiders this can look like money just moving around the same pot. There is also no transparency into whether a Google ad’s quality is determined the same way as a typical advertiser. Marty Weintraub of AimClear analyzed SpyFu data that showed Google may be spending millions to promote AdWords on SEO-related keywords, for example. “We wonder what the quality score is tendering Ads about AdWords for SEO KWs?,” Weintraub asked. There is no way of knowing this because Google hasn’t said publicly whether its ads are held to the same, higher or lower quality thresholds as other advertisers. What else could Google do? Looking back at the first two auction examples shown above, one can see Google’s argument that the pricing measures it takes, plus the fact that it appears to win most of the auctions it enters, means its participation does not “directly” impact advertisers’ pricing. Removing the AdRank of its own ads is when calculating pricing for others is good practice. Yet the last two scenarios illustrate that fix only plays an absolute role if the auctions occur in a vacuum and advertisers’ bids aren’t influenced by Google as competitor. The company has been clear that that’s not what happens. So what else could Google do? One can argue Google shouldn’t act as both auctioneer and bidder at all. However, it’s harder to argue that Nest shouldn’t be allowed to advertise its thermostats on Google, for example. Either way, there are steps Google could take to be clearer about its role and better inform its customers of steps it takes to address conflicts of interest. For starters, it could clarify whether its ads are held to different quality score thresholds and explicitly acknowledge that advertisers pay as if Google didn’t win its position, not as if Google didn’t bid. That’s easy. Some more involved ideas: Google could provide competing advertisers with more transparency into its performance in the auction. Envision a type of Auction Insights report for those competitors, but one that shows the Quality Scores (external), ad positions and actual CPCs. Going even further, the company could provide master read-only access to its AdWords accounts. Use them as teaching tools and show how the company uses its own auction-based system. It sounds far fetched, but not completely crazy, right? That Google and Alphabet’s expanding hardware businesses want to use the search engine to promote their products makes sense given its enormous reach and ability to convert. Google is also not the only digital company to use its own auction to buy advertising. But it is the biggest and most profitable digital media company on the planet, and participating in its own marketplace has implications for an increasing number of its customers.

Thanks, TC Team Startup BattlefieldWe're Accepting Applications for Startup Battlefield At Disrupt NY Apply Today Ex-Googler (and Cisco’s newest board member) Amy Chang on her leap into startups Posted 17 hours ago by Connie Loizos (@cookie) 0 SHARES Next Story Facebook says it will open up for independent ad audit Wednesday night, at a StrictlyVC event in San Francisco, venture capitalist Aileen Lee took the stage to interview Amy Chang, a former eBay product manager turned head of Google Analytics turned startup founder. It’s a transition that has introduced Chang to night sweats, she readily admitted. Chang’s three-year-old startup, Accompany,  received one of its first checks from Lee’s firm, Cowboy Ventures. And Lee asked Chang about what it’s like to leave behind a cushy paycheck to launch something new, even with her former Google colleague, Matthias Ruhl — a large-scale systems design expert — by her side as her cofounder. For one thing, Chang said, getting the company to the point where it could launch publicly took far longer than either she or Ruhl imagined it would. Though they now claim that they’ve built the second-largest database of people behind LinkedIn — Accompany basically creates cheat sheets for folks  who need to get up to speed quickly on the new people and companies they meet every day — it took them 2.5 years. They’ve also had to raise a bunch of money — $40 million altogether so far. “It was a much bigger data challenge than we expected,” Chang said. “We had to build this whole data platform ourselves. Though once you have textured understanding of how a person’s network lays out . . . you can serve them a lot better.” The native Texan, who nabbed her electrical engineering degree from Stanford and stayed in California, has also learned the pleasures and pain of working with 40 people, compared with the hundreds she managed at Google. “When you’re at Google and it’s more a GM role, you’re managing to a mean.” Explained Chang, “On any given day, maybe 20 percent of people are performing at a 5 [level] out of a 10. They’ve got stuff going on or are distracted by something. That 20 percent who aren’t operating at a 9 or 10 level of intensity is okay, because in the grand scheme of things, you’re [still in good shape].” When it’s 40 people, “every person matters. I know now whose child is sick — whose cat is sick. I have to make sure people’s emotional needs are met because if they aren’t, they can’t focus and perform” at the level required to move a startup meaningfully forward every day. The good news for Chang: her leap out of Google appears to be paying off. Though she declined to get into granular detail about her business, owing to competitive concerns (Accompany is far from the only virtual assistant game in town), she was recently pursued by Cisco, which invited her to join its board. She says that plum role came about because recruiter Jim Citrin, who leads Spencer Stuart’s North American CEO practice, began using Accompany last year, “got excited about it,” and told Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins to try it, too. “He was like, ‘Who makes this?'” It helps that Cisco was looking for a digital native who’d grown up with mobile and with analytics in particular to add to its board. “I kind of fit the profile, and there was good chemistry,” she said. The position — which pays her a $75,000 annual retainer and gives her a grant of restricted stock worth several hundred thousand dollars, says a recent New York Times article — presumably offsets much of the financial pressure that many other company founders face. But Chang says she still wakes up in a cold panic at 3 a.m. oftentimes. She has resigned herself to the fact that it’s the new normal. But she did have some advice to other aspiring founders in the room: “Do not wake up your spouse every time it happens.” 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report VIDEO | 2:38 | Crunch Report Carl Bass on his surprising Autodesk exit — and what’s next 13 hours ago | Connie Loizos Uncorking innovation with Treasury Wine Estates in Napa 14 hours ago | Lora Kolodny Beats X bring Apple’s wireless headphone tech to a tethered form factor 15 hours ago | Brian Heater Facebook says it will open up for independent ad audit 18 hours ago | Anthony Ha Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report: Prince returns to Spotify 9 hours ago | Anthony Ha Weekly Roundup: Tech companies rally against Trump’s immigration ban, Zenefits cuts workforce again 10 hours ago | Anna Escher Trump’s immigration ban is terrible for entrepreneurs 10 hours ago | Samia Bahsoun Payback’s a gift 11 hours ago | Talia Goldberg, Jeremy Levine Comment moderation powered by Up Next Facebook says it will open up for independent ad audit Posted 18 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings Data Migration Consultant at Exerp (West Palm Beach, FL, United States) Integration Consultant at Exerp (West Palm Beach, FL, United States) SENIOR ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE at Waxman Strategies (Washington, DC, United States) Senior Backend Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Senior Data Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

Now both video services are in the middle of a major reset and Facebook is showing increasing interest. _____________________________________ By Mark Mulligan of MIDiA and The Music Industry Blog Music video’s two power players are both in the news for strategic resets. On the one hand YouTube has announced that it is merging its YouTube Music and Google Play Music teams while on the other hand Vevo has announced it is postponing the launch of its subscription service in favour of prioritising global expansion. These are both important developments in their own rights but together form part of a changing narrative for music video. Music video is streaming music’s killer app. According to MIDiA’s latest consumer survey, 45% of consumers watch music videos on YouTube or Vevo every month, while 25% of consumers use YouTube for music every week (more than any of the streaming audio services). So what YouTube and Vevo do has real impact. YouTube Is Where Google Is Placing Its Music Bets YouTube’s merging of teams is not a huge surprise. It always appeared overkill having 2 separate teams, especially considering that Play was performing so poorly in the market (its weekly active users are measured in single digit percentages) and that Google’s music priority has always been, and will always be, YouTube. Although nothing will change immediately in terms of user proposition, the strategic direction of travel is clear: YouTube is where Google will place its music bets. Which places even greater importance on rights holders and Google coming to an understanding around royalty payments. YouTube moving to minimum guaranteed per stream rates is untenable (for Google) as is the Value Gap/Grab (for rights holders). Something has to give. My long-term bet is still on Google creating a parallel music industry around YouTube, one that is entirely opted out of the traditional music industry’s rights frameworks. But a more immediate concern for Google is contingency planning in the event of Vevo upping sticks and becoming the centre piece of a revamped Facebook video play. A combination of no Vevo and disgruntled rights holders would be a recipe for disaster for YouTube’s music strategy. Facebook And Vevo May Be Courting Vevo jumping ship to Facebook is not as far-fetched as it might have seemed when it was first mooted a few years ago. Facebook is now the world’s 2nd biggest online video property and has finally admitted that it is a media company. Slowing ad revenues in 2017 will see Facebook double down on ancillary revenue streams and content will be a key plank of that strategy. Games is the biggest addressable market and it has already made moves in that direction. Growing video is another. While streaming music is a relatively small market opportunity for Facebook, it has wide appeal. Launching an AYCE streaming service would be an ill-advised (and highly unlikely) option for Facebook, but partnering with Vevo would be a higher margin, lower risk way of getting into music. It would also be the perfect vehicle with which to showcase Facebook’s next generation of video UI, which will include features such as curation, channels, recommendations etc. In short, a lot less like Facebook video and lot more like YouTube. The Rise Of Music Inspired Video Interestingly, Vevo’s CEO Erik Huggers has announced that Vevo will be increasing its focus on short form, non-music video, such as artist interviews, mini-documentaries, and animated shorts. This snackable, highly shareable content bears closer resemblance to the sort of video that works well in Facebook’s more social-centric video platform than YouTube’s more viewer-centric environment. Vevo’s non-music video approach is smart. As we explained in our report ‘From Music Video To Music Inspired Video’, if rights holders want their share of overall video time to grow, or at least hold their own, then they need to start exploring creating music related video rather than just music videos. The core consumption format will still be the music video, but the additional content expands reach and time spent. In a Facebook environment (especially if Instagram was incorporated) this sort of content would spread like wildfire. Add into the mix that Huggers also referenced Vevo’s prioritization of building its direct audience via its own apps (ie not via YouTube) and we might just be starting to see the emerging shape of a planning-for-life-after-YouTube strategy. Even if Vevo decided to stick with YouTube (which remains the most likely outcome), it could use all of these moves as leverage for getting a better deal. Change is afoot in the music video space and we may just be beginning to see the two key players beginning to put competitive space between each other. But perhaps most tellingly, as both companies up their game, they are also both, in different ways distancing themselves from their subscription plays. Music video is the killer streaming app for many reasons. The fact that it is free is reason number one, and Vevo and YouTube both know it.

SUBSCRIBE Google releases Chrome version with the first browser support for WebVR New capability means that users no longer need to download an app to view online VR. Barry Levine on February 10, 2017 at 11:27 am More A 3-D VR interior from Matterport This week, Google is updating its Chrome browser for Android with the first browser support for Web VR — a capability that could dramatically affect the use and development of VR content. Previously, if a user wanted to view VR content in a stereo headset viewer like Google’s Daydream View, you had to download one of a number of VR apps. Like the company’s Cardboard viewer, Daydream View works with a smartphone as the display and processing unit. This newest Chrome is the stable release; a beta version of Chrome with WebVR support was announced in December. In this WebVR-supporting Chrome browser, the user can simply click a button and then see the material as VR in the viewer. WebVR supports Daydream’s accelerator for tracking head movements, and its remote control. Or users can view non-stereo VR content through Chrome on a desktop or laptop and navigate it with their finger or a mouse. No separate app to download, no multitude of apps that developers need to target.

This week, we’ve got the latest on a strange glitch appearing in Google’s mobile search, a new beta search engine launched by Creative Commons, and the decline of brand hashtags in Super Bowl ads. Plus, a new report has indicated that consumers don’t find the vast majority of brands meaningful; and Google reveals that custom 404 pages are not beneficial to SEO. Google’s mobile search glitches, indexes desktop sites If you’ve been keeping an ear to the ground – or the Twittersphere – in the world of Google SEO, you might have heard that strange things have been happening with Google’s mobile index over the past few days. Last week and early this week, some astute observers noticed that Google’s mobile search was indexing desktop websites where it would normally be indexing the mobile version of that site. The suddenness of the switch, coming on the heels of Google’s newly-implemented penalty for intrusive mobile interstitials and ahead of its planned rollout of a mobile-first search index, had Twitter abuzz with speculation as to what could be going on. Noticing separate mobile sites dropping out of Google Mobile in favour of desktop versions across several major sites… #seo #mobile pic.twitter.com/LYoEVNUgOn — Glynn Davies (@glynndaviesesq) February 6, 2017 @VishMarathe411 Happy to look at examples. My guess is the sites might not be set up correctly. — John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) February 3, 2017 In a post for Search Engine Watch yesterday, I broke down the events of the last few days, with the help of some data from Pi Datametrics, to try and work out what happened to the affected sites – and whether it could be a sign of an impending mobile-first index launch. Creative Commons has launched a new free-to-use photo search engine If you’ve ever worked in online publishing, chances are you know the unique frustration of searching for a free-to-use image to break up your blog post, or serve as the perfect feature image. Luckily, that just got a lot easier with the launch of a new search engine from Creative Commons, CC Search. It has always been possible to search for Creative Commons-licensed images using a search filter on Google or Flickr, and the Creative Commons website has its own search portal – although it has always been careful to emphasise that this is not a search engine, “but rather offers convenient access to search services provided by other independent organizations“, meaning that CC is not responsible for the results returned. Now, however, it seems that Creative Commons is ready to go full search engine. In a blog post announcing the beta release of CC Search, Creative Commons CEO Ryan Merkley wrote that, There is no “front door” to the commons, and the tools people need to curate, share, and remix works aren’t yet available. We want to make the commons more usable, and this is our next step in that direction. Bad news, brands: Consumers could probably live without you While some of the largest brands in the world spent upwards of $5 million on Super Bowl ads last weekend, a report by Havas Group has delivered some sobering news for brands: consumers wouldn’t care if 74% of them disappeared off the face of the earth. The report, entitled ‘Meaningful Brands’, has been billed as “the largest global analysis of its kind”. It polled more than 300,000 people in 33 countries about 1,500 global brands in 15 industry sectors in order to draw conclusions about the way that people interact with and form connections with brands. Unsurprisingly, the brands which made the “meaningful” list were also some of the biggest names, including Google, Microsoft, PayPal, Kellogg’s, Disney and Nike. Which begs the question: what is a “meaningful” brand? Is it just a brand that you’ve heard of, or is there more to it than that? And do these findings mean that smaller brands should give up trying to make an impact?

Seven tools to help you run multichannel digital marketing campaigns Six steps to a stronger online brand Hashtags were down and URLs up in this year’s Super Bowl In more brand news, references to hashtags only appeared in 30% of Super Bowl advertisements this year, down from 45% a year ago. The Super Bowl is a huge brand extravaganza, and as such, can provide a useful insight into trends around brand advertising, what works and what doesn’t. According to an analysis conducted by Marketing Land, the drop in hashtag usage this year is the continuation of a general decline that has been taking place since 2014, when hashtag usage peaked at 57%. Meanwhile, URLs are on the rise, and have overtaken hashtags for the first time with a presence in 39% of ads. While this might seem like a return to the past, it also makes sense for advertisers to direct users to websites they own, as opposed to social media services that they don’t. Custom 404 pages have no SEO benefit – but quality is still important The SEM Post reported this week on an interesting revelation from Google’s Webmaster Central Office Hours hangout: Google does not crawl the content of custom 404 pages on sites. John Mueller, Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google, said that: “So if we see a 404, then we see a 404 and don’t look at the content.  We don’t look to see what is visible on your 404 pages, on your server error pages, we essentially assume that something that the user can look at and kind of deal with, we don’t follow the content on pages that return any of these error response codes.” This might come as a blow to some web developers who use a custom 404 page for SEO purposes, but custom 404 pages are still helpful from a user perspective, as they can help reorient lost users to the right part of the site. The Google Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines recommend giving well-thought-out 404 pages the highest quality rating; they just don’t contribute directly to SEO.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Pixel XL and Pixel back in stock (but act fast) Chris Davies - Feb 10, 2017 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google made a couple of great smartphones in the Pixel and Pixel XL, then couldn’t handle the demand, but if you’re quick you can pick up one of the surprisingly rare Android handsets. The Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL are back in stock from the company’s online store, after being listed “out of stock” for an extended period. Not every color option is currently available, however. On the Pixel front, at time of publication all three color variants of the 5-inch smartphone are available this morning: “Very Silver”, “Quite Black”, and the limited edition “Really Blue”. However, only one of the storage versions is in-stock, and unfortunately that’s the smaller capacity 32 GB phone, priced at $649. If you want the 128 GB version – which is only available in silver and black, incidentally, at a $100 premium – you’re going to have to stay patient. Over on the Pixel XL side, things are even more constrained. In silver, the 5.5-inch smartphone is only available in 32 GB form for $769; the 128 GB version is still unavailable today. If you’re okay with a black Pixel XL, that’s currently available in both 32GB and 128GB capacities. The 32 GB “Really Blue” Pixel XL is still out of stock. Managing supplies of the Pixel has not been Google’s finest hour, frankly. Demand for the Pixel XL in particular has seen the phone unavailable for weeks or even months at a time, and Google’s refusal to allow back-orders and ship out devices when they return into stock has left would-be owners frustrated. Nonetheless, it’s not just Google’s fault. “Exclusive carrier partner” Verizon must share some of the blame, and the operator hasn’t helped itself by being vague about shipping dates. There had been hopes that, post-holidays, supplies would become more fluid, but that doesn’t appear to have happened. NOW READ: Google Pixel XL Review Of course, as problems go, having a product so in-demand that you simply can’t keep it on the virtual shelves isn’t really something to complain about. At least not if you’re Google, that is. For those who actually want to pick up a Pixel or Pixel XL themselves, though, don’t sleep on the opportunity today, because there’s no telling how many handsets are currently waiting in boxes for immediate shipping now.

Google Chromebook laptops are impractical for many people because they‚Äôre little more than expensive paperweights when they‚Äôre out of range of an internet connection. Yet they‚Äôve defied expectations and made tremendous inroads in one of the least likely places: U.S. schools. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK, N.Y. - The Google Chromebook, a type of stripped-down laptop, isn't a practical mobile device for many people — mostly because it basically turns into an expensive paperweight whenever it can't find a Wi-Fi connection. Yet Chromebooks have defied expectations and made major inroads in an unexpected environment — U.S. schools. In retrospect, that shouldn't be too surprising. Chromebooks are cheap and easy to manage, making them popular with budget-constrained schools with limited tech-support staff. And Wi-Fi is now common enough in U.S. schools and homes to make an internet-dependent device practical for students. Google doesn't want to stop there. It's releasing new models in partnership with Samsung that are designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers. They have several tablet-like features, including a stylus, touch controls and a 360-degree hinge that allows you to turn the screen faceup. One starts selling Sunday for $449; a more powerful version comes out in April for $100 more. Google and its manufacturing partners are trying to shed the Chromebook's perception as underperforming budget devices. But even with premium models, expanding beyond U.S. schools won't be easy. CHROMEBOOKS GET SCHOOLED For personal computers and tablets, Chromebook's share of the U.S. education market was 49 per cent last year, up from 40 per cent in 2015 and 9 per cent in 2013, according to IDC figures released this week. But education accounts for just 14 per cent of the 110 million devices shipped in the U.S. last year — and Chromebooks make up just 9 per cent of that broader total. Their numbers are also low abroad, even in schools. The Chromebook's popularity in U.S. education is also largely limited to grades K-12, analysts say.

Even in the U.S., the iPad is better for many creative tasks such as recording and editing movies. Students studying engineering, robotics and graphics won't be able to use Chromebooks to run the kind of specialized software that's available for Macs and Windows laptops. "But that's not needed for 98 per cent of our students," said Tracy Dabbs, co-ordinator of technology and innovation at the Burlington-Edison School District near Seattle. Many school districts limit Apple and Windows computers for the students who specifically need them, then provide Chromebooks for the rest. McDowell County, for instance, has 5,500 Chromebooks, 1,200 iPads — and only 100 Macs and 200 Windows PCs. RIVALS STAGE A COMEBACK Last year, Apple gave iPads in schools some Chromebook-like features unavailable to the general public. That includes ways to let multiple people use a single tablet and management tools for tech-support staff. A new Classroom app lets teachers control what apps students run and track their progress. Apple also provides classroom tools for teachers and students. Free e-books offer teachers step-by-step guides on using iPad apps and curriculum suggestions for everyday subjects. A separate app lets kids learn programming using the same language developers use to build iPad apps. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced last month new online apps and management tools for schools, along with Windows PCs priced similarly to Chromebooks. BEYOND SCHOOLS Huang said some businesses are giving Chromebooks a second look, especially in retail, banking and other settings where people share computers. But in many offices, the lack of business software such as Office is a major hurdle. Google's alternative lacks many advanced capabilities found in Office, and habits are hard to change. Google is trying to make Chromebooks more palatable by letting them run Android apps designed for phones and tablets. It's testing this capability on a handful of Chromebook models, including the new ones from Samsung. That makes it possible to install Office, Adobe Photoshop and many apps on a Chromebook, though these tablet versions have limited features compared with versions for Macs or Windows laptops.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       In this Feb. 8, 2017, photo, a Google Chromebook displays Adobe Lightroom in New York.

Google Chromebook laptops are impractical for many people because they’re little more than expensive paperweights when they’re out of range of an internet connection. Yet they’ve defied expectations and made tremendous inroads in one of the least likely places: U.S. schools. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK (AP) — The Google Chromebook, a type of stripped-down laptop, isn't a practical mobile device for many people — mostly because it basically turns into an expensive paperweight whenever it can't find a Wi-Fi connection. Yet Chromebooks have defied expectations and made major inroads in an unexpected environment — U.S. schools. In retrospect, that shouldn't be too surprising. Chromebooks are cheap and easy to manage, making them popular with budget-constrained schools with limited tech-support staff. And Wi-Fi is now common enough in U.S. schools and homes to make an internet-dependent device practical for students. Google doesn't want to stop there. It's releasing new models in partnership with Samsung that are designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers. They have several tablet-like features, including a stylus, touch controls and a 360-degree hinge that allows you to turn the screen faceup. One starts selling Sunday for $449; a more powerful version comes out in April for $100 more. Google and its manufacturing partners are trying to shed the Chromebook's perception as underperforming budget devices. But even with premium models, expanding beyond U.S. schools won't be easy. CHROMEBOOKS GET SCHOOLED For personal computers and tablets, Chromebook's share of the U.S. education market was 49 percent last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2013, according to IDC figures released this week. But education accounts for just 14 percent of the 110 million devices shipped in the U.S. last year — and Chromebooks make up just 9 percent of that broader total. Their numbers are also low abroad, even in schools. The Chromebook's popularity in U.S. education is also largely limited to grades K-12, analysts say. Macs and Windows laptops are still dominant on college campuses. ROUGH START Chromebooks use a lightweight operating system designed to get people online faster, without having to wait around for the computer to start up. Much of the heavy lifting on Chromebooks gets done on Google's remote servers, so Chromebooks themselves don't need fast chips or lots of storage. Early on, though, that made Chromebooks seem cheap and underpowered, which "soured consumer expectations right off the bat," IDC analyst Linn Huang said. Online storage for photos and documents online was much less common in 2011 when Chromebooks launched , so their limited local storage was initially unappealing. And the few apps available for Chromebooks didn't work offline, at least at the time. DIFFERING NEEDS But what constrains consumers can actually be liberating in education. Most kids don't need laptops on the bus or other locations where they can't connect to Wi-Fi. And they don't miss business software like Microsoft Office; Google's online apps for documents and spreadsheets do just fine for homework. "What surprised us was how quickly it took off in education," said Kan Liu, who oversees Chromebooks at Google. Apple's iPad was hot at the time, but Google sold the Chromebook on convenience. They're easier for classrooms to share; just sign in with a Google account, and a student's apps and documents instantly appear. Teachers also have online tools to lock down what apps and sites students can use. And with models available for less than $200, schools can get a few Chromebooks for the price of an iPad or a rival laptop. "It allows us to put more devices in students' hands," said Aaron Slutsky, chief technology officer for McDowell County Schools in North Carolina. FAR FROM UNIVERSAL But Chromebook's success story in schools is largely an American one, and it's likely to stay that way. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa notes that Chromebooks are useless in China because the device depends on Google services that aren't available there. And in emerging countries, where a budget laptop would be ideal, she said internet access isn't reliable enough. Even in the U.S., the iPad is better for many creative tasks such as recording and editing movies.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → Where My Data Lives  February 10, 2017February 10, 2017 ⌘ Permalink I spent some time this week going through the various subscriptions I pay for and seeing if there any adjustments I need to make heading into 2017. As these things often do, that quickly turned into a full-scale evaluation of the primary services I use every day to store and access data. Here’s where I currently have information stored: iCloud: iCloud Photo Library iOS backups Keychain (mostly for syncing Wi-Fi credentials) Family calendars Notes Safari bookmarks Google: Chrome bookmarks Personal email, contacts, calendars, photo backups, shared documents 512 Pixels email and shared documents Relay FM email, contacts, calendars, shared documents Dropbox: Most working files Shared files and folders Others: 1Password for passwords and secure notes Home NAS Archived work Logic & Final Cut Pro projects Mac backups Todoist for tasks My personal Gmail account is free, but I pay for almost everything else on that list, including additional iCloud storage space, Google Apps for two companies, Dropbox Pro, 1Password for Teams and Todoist Premium. Platform vendors would like their customers to keep all of their data on their service. In reality, both Google and Apple offer just about everything a person needs in terms of cloud services. That said, Google and Apple are good at different things. Dropbox beats them both as far as storage, and 1Password is in a different league than things like iCloud Keychain. I could live just in iCloud, or just with Google’s services, but blending them means using the best of what’s out there. When it comes to that blending, I really have to give Apple credit. Both macOS and iOS do a great job when it comes to using non-iCloud services.1 Apple rightfully holds some things back — like device backups — but using Google for my email, contacts and calendars with my device’s built-in apps is pretty damn seamless.2 I can use Dropbox as a document provider, using it as my de-facto file system on my iPhone, as I do on my Macs. If I used streaming music, iOS and macOS don’t care too much if I use Apple Music or Spotify. I’m not sure how much of this will change in 2017. I really like almost everything about my current arrangement, but I’m a nerd, so I’m sure I’ll burn it all down sooner or later. Good luck using iCloud data on Android without a weird third-party tool. ↩ I haven’t even had Mail.app eat any email in a long time! ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post RSS Sponsorship: HoudahSpot: File search for Mac — powerful, fast and easy-to-use.

Gadget Hacks Android Hacks WonderHowTo Gadget Hacks Driverless Invisiverse Next Reality Null Byte Android Basics Glossary of Terms Galaxy S8 Rumors HTC 11 Rumors Everything Pixel Rooting Guide Gaming Roundups Forum Stay Secure How-Tos News How To: Get Rid of the Built-in Google Search Bar on Almost Any Launcher By Dallas Thomas Thu 4:21 PM Get Rid of the Built-in Google Search Bar on Almost Any Launcher Almost every Android device comes with a Google search bar embedded directly into its stock home screen app. But Google search is available in so many different places on Android that having this bar in your launcher is almost overkill. On top of that, Google recently changed the logo overlay to a more colorful one that may clash with your home screen theme, so there's plenty of reasons to dislike this feature. Unfortunately, most stock home screen apps don't allow you to get rid of this search bar, so in the past, your only option to remove it has been to switch to a custom launcher. But now, thanks to a new Xposed module from developer jeboo, you can give the Google search bar the ax in one simple step—and to top that off, it will work with almost any stock launcher out there. Don't Miss: 6 Unique Launchers That'll Get You to Ditch Your Stock Home Screen App Requirements Xposed Framework installed "Unknown sources" enabled Step 1: Install Google Search Bar Destroyer To get started, head to the Download section in your Xposed Installer app and search for Google Search Bar Destroyer, then tap the top result. From there, swipe over to the Versions tab, then hit the "Download" button and press "Install" when prompted. When that's finished, make sure to activate the module and reboot so that your changes will take effect. Step 2: Enjoy Your Launcher Without the Search Bar When you get back up, you should immediately notice that the search bar on your home screen is now gone—yep, that's really all there is to it. The module works by blocking a hook that the Google app uses to inject itself into your home screen, so this should work with any launcher that comes with a permanently-embedded Google search bar. The only minor downside here is that you can't use the space that the bar previously occupied, but at the very least, that redundant, gaudy search bar is finally gone!

By Liam Tung | February 10, 2017 -- 14:27 GMT (06:27 PST) | Topic: Virtual Reality Bear 71 is one of several resources that can be viewed with a Daydream headset using Chrome. Image: Google You can now experience virtual reality on the web with Google's latest version of the Chrome browser. Chrome now includes WebVR, a set of technologies for interacting with virtual-reality content in the browser. For VR developers, WebVR holds the promise of building a single web app to reach different headsets and browsers, rather than having write a different app for each platform. The new feature follows the December release of WebVR in the Chrome Android beta. "With the latest version of Chrome, we're bringing VR to the web, making it as easy to step inside Air Force One as it is to access your favorite webpage," says Chrome product manager Lindsay Megan. For now, users will need to have a Daydream Android phone, such as Google's Pixel, or Google's Daydream View headset to immerse themselves in VR on the web. However, Google plans to add support for Cardboard in the future, which would open up options for iOS users. While it's still early days for WebVR, Megan lists several resources that can be viewed with a Daydream headset today. These sites include a documentary called Bear 71, as well as Matterport's, a 300,000+ library of celebrity homes, museums, and other real places. There's also a catalogue of VR stories and documentaries at Within, over a million 3D scenes in VR hosted on Sketchfab, and WebVR Lab. As ZDNet sister site CNET notes, Google and Firefox maker Mozilla developed WebVR along with Facebook's Oculus team, but the only generally available browser to support it yet is Chrome on Android, with WebVR currently implemented in Mozilla's Firefox nightly build. Microsoft is also adding support for WebVR in a future version of its Edge browser and its HoloLens kit. Samsung's Gear and HTC Vive also support WebVR. People can view VR websites from any phone or desktop, though they need to interact with a finger or mouse.

Abhijit Ahaskar Google Photos now automatically clubs all the photos into categories based on what is common between them. Google Photos cloud storage is quite popular with smartphone users due to its close integration with Google’s Drive. However, due to its limited options, it was not very user-friendly to use. Google has added new features in it in the last few months which makes navigation through Photos easy and swift. While it still may not qualify it as the default photo app for many, using it won’t be a challenge anymore. Here are some of the new features that every Android user can benefit from. Smart layout Google Photos now automatically clubs all the photos into categories based on what is common between them. This means all your WhatsApp images will be clubbed under a folder called WhatsApp by itself. Similarly, all the car images on the phone will be clubbed in a folder called Cars. Find people What makes the Albums feature even more interesting is the built-in AI and facial recognition tool which automatically detects all the faces in any photo and then finds old photos of people who figure in a recently taken photo. All the old photos are then presented as cards in the Albums section under People. To access this, user needs to enable Face Grouping option in Settings. Create animation This is another highlight of Google Photos which allows user to combine several images to create an animated slideshow. To create an animation, tap on menu icon on the right side of the screen and select animation. Animation allows one to select up to 50 images at a time. Collage maker Collage making apps are quite popular with smartphone users. Some social media platform like Instagram even have their own collage apps. If you have Google Photos on your phone, you don’t need another app to create a photo collage. User can create a photo collage within Google Photos by tapping on Collage in the phone’s menu and selecting two to nine photos. The collage will be saved in a folder called Collage. Free up space In case you want to free up space on your phone, you can delete photos that have been backed up on Google Drive. For doing this one doesn’t have to go through all the images one by one. Freeing up device storage can save users the task by finding all the photos that have been backed up online and still have a copy on the phone’s storage.

[Photo: courtesy of Samsung] More from Innovation Agents Interest In Birth Control Startups Surges In The Trump Era This Job Platform Designed By A 26-Year-Old Informs Managers Of Their Bias Is It Time For Investors To Tie Executive Compensation To Diversity Goals? Jared Newman 02.10.17 10:30 AM Within an hour of setting up Samsung's Chromebook Pro, I was doing things that used to be impossible on these laptops. I found a decent Markdown editor in Epsilon Notes and used a OneDrive sync application to pull in all my online documents. I plugged in my Xbox 360 controller, installed Moonlight, and started streaming games over Wi-Fi from my desktop PC. I even signed into multiple Slack teams without having to open multiple browser tabs. All of this was possible because the Chromebook Pro—finally—runs Android apps. For every new Chromebook from this month onward, along with a few from last year, users are no longer limited to web-based apps. Instead, we can install anything we want through the Google Play Store. Owning a Chromebook, in other words, is no longer an exercise self-restraint. For Chromebook's existing devotees, this might seem like heresy. Chromebooks are supposed to be fast, simple, and secure, and the addition of Android apps inevitably creates trade-offs. But while I was once among the skeptics, I've come around to believing that those trade-offs are worthwhile. Made For Android The Samsung Chromebook Pro isn't strictly a laptop. Like some of the convertible designs we've seen in Windows PCs, this Chromebook has a touch screen that flips around 360 degrees to become a tablet. It even has an accelerometer and gyroscope so you can play tilt-based games. Not that you'd want to go full tablet mode too often. The Chromebook Pro weighs 2.5 pounds, so the arms tire after holding it for too long. (The superior, yet underrated, approach with these convertible designs is to fold the screen around partially, with the keyboard side down and the screen facing you on angle.) The Chromebook Pro also includes a stylus, which slides out of the laptop's right side. Although the stylus isn't pressure-sensitive, certain apps, such as Google Keep, will record thicker lines from faster pen strokes. The Chromebook Pro also supports palm rejection system-wide, so you can rest your hand on the screen while sketching in Android apps like Autodesk SketchBook, Adobe Draw, and Microsoft OneNote. I have some minor quibbles with the Chromebook Pro hardware: The delete key is so small that I often miss it, and the volume rocker doesn't recognize when you've flipped the device into tablet mode, so pressing down in that orientation turns the volume up. Still, Samsung's Chromebook Pro won't be the only laptop-tablet hybrid running Google's operating system in the near future. Lenovo has promised a couple of waves of new Chromebooks in March and September, borrowing from its Windows hybrid designs, and Acer has shown off a rugged, convertible Chromebook for education. Samsung's also launching the Chromebook Plus, which is similar to the Pro but with a lightweight ARM processor. These new designs, along with Android apps, will likely play into a big consumer Chromebook push in this year. App Awkwardness Before Google revs its marketing engines for Android apps on Chromebooks, the company might want to iron out some kinks that I've run into over the past couple of weeks. (The Chromebook Pro I tried was pre-production hardware; the Google Play Store for Chrome OS was in beta.) The strangest example was the way some Android apps flickered on the screen when switching from tablet to laptop mode. I also found that double tapping and dragging on the trackpad was unreliable for highlighting text or moving things around the screen in Android apps. And because Android apps have their own file system, which is mostly inaccessible from Chrome OS's own file explorer, you need a separate file management app to access locally saved Android files. Here I am wondering whether I need a Windows laptop anymore. Some individual apps are also error-prone. Microsoft Office would not respond to scroll gestures on the screen or trackpad, and a game called 3D Labyrinth would not display properly on the screen. At one point, the racing game Asphalt Xtreme wouldn't offer touch controls, because it was convinced I had a game controller plugged in, and I couldn't get HDHomeRun View—an app for watching antenna broadcasts over a local network—to recognize my TV tuner. Even apps that work properly aren't always properly optimized for larger screens, keyboards, and trackpads. MobiSystems' PhotoSuite doesn't support keyboard shortcuts such as Ctrl-Z to undo, the official Reddit app only runs in a phone-like vertical window, and I've yet to find an app that offers the kind of contextual right-click menus that come standard in desktop software. Although Google has been asking top app makers to optimize their software, most apps still feel like they were made for phones and tablets. Getting More Stuff Done Aside from those issues—which will likely subside over time—Android apps also introduce some inherent compromises. Storage space, for instance, must become a bigger consideration for Chromebook buyers, because the old norm of 16 GB isn't really enough to store a lot of apps. (The Chromebook Pro comes with 32 GB instead.) Android apps can also put a greater strain on system resources, especially if you're running lots of them at once, so buyers might want to seek Chromebooks with more RAM and processing power. I'm also mildly worried about security and privacy, given the history of malware slipping into the Google Play Store, and the tendency of some apps to request more data than they really need. Yet despite all of these issues and concerns, here I am using a Chromebook in ways I never did before, and wondering whether I really need a Windows laptop anymore. Unlike my Microsoft Surface Pro 3, Chromebooks start up almost instantly and update themselves unobtrusively, and now they have a better selection of touch-enabled apps. For the type of detachable and convertible laptop designs that Windows pioneered, Chrome OS now seems like a better fit. Never miss a story.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A The 20 Most 'Simple' Brands by Ayaz Nanji  |   February 10, 2017  |  950 views Tweet Kindle Email Top Consumers in the United States say Google and Netflix are the most "simple" brands, according to recent research from Siegel+Gale. The report was based on data from a survey conducted in July 2016 of 14,044 consumers in nine countries (the US, the UK, Germany, Sweden, China, India, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Japan). Respondents were asked to rate major brands on the simplicity/complexity of their products and pricing relative to industry peers as well as the quality of interactions/communications (whether the company is trustworthy/easy to deal with). Each brand was then assigned a Simplicity Score based on the responses. Respondents in the US ranked Google as the most simple brand for the second year in a row, primarily because of its search engine user experience, which is viewed as "intuitive and easy to understand." Netflix took the No. 2 spot, also for the second year in a row, because the company "has figured out what customers want," according to one subscriber interviewed by the researchers. Discount supermarket Aldi ranks as the most simple brand globally. Google is second, followed by Netflix, Ikea, Amazon, KFC, YouTube, McDonald's, and Subway.

Phone Arena conducted battery tests and the results are quite impressive.  ( Samsung ) Advertisement The recently unveiled Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) is apparently a real beast when it comes to battery performance, beating the Galaxy S7 and several other flagships. The smartphone reportedly offers outstanding battery performance that's tough to beat. Compared to many other smartphones out there, the Galaxy A5 (2017) delivers mad battery life on a single charge even in intensive scenarios. Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy A series back in early January, introducing the upgraded Galaxy A3, Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 iterations. The Galaxy A series doesn't comprise of high-end flagships, but they do combine affordability with good performance and a premium feel. The Galaxy A5 (2017) midranger has a 5.2-inch full HD (1080p) display and a 14-nannometer Exynos SoC that offers great power efficiency, maximizing the performance of the 3,000 mAh battery. The Galaxy A5 (2017) should last for up to 13 hours of 3G web browsing, 16 hours on 4G LTE, and 18 hours on Wi-Fi. With some idle moments in between, this should easily translate to a two-day battery life or even three for those who don't use the device that much. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) Battery Life Test And Comparison Phone Arena ran its own battery tests to see how the Galaxy A5 (2017) fares and the results are quite impressive. The publication tested the Galaxy A5 (2017), the Galaxy A5 (2016), the Huawei Nova, the Honor 8, the Galaxy S7, the iPhone 7, the iPhone 6s and the Google Pixel, setting all smartphones at the same 200-nit brightness level. The Galaxy A5 (2017) outperformed all other smartphones, lasting for an impressive 11 hours and 9 minutes on a charge. That's nearly double the battery life of the Galaxy S7, which lasted for 6 hours and 37 minutes, and significantly longer than the iPhone 7, which lasted for 7 hours and 46 minutes. The Google Pixel lasted for 7 hours and 45 minutes, along the same lines as the iPhone 7. The new Galaxy A5 iteration also lasted significantly longer than its predecessor, as the 2016 Galaxy A5 turned off the lights after 9 hours and 55 minutes. That's still a great battery life, but the new Galaxy A5 (2017) takes the cake. It would've ben interesting if the Droid Maxx 2 was included in the test, but it wasn't invited to the party. Recharging Time Phone Arena also tested how long it takes for each of those smartphones to recharge their batteries using a stock wall charger, starting out at zero percent until they are fully charged. The Galaxy A5 (2017) fared great in this test too, reaching 100 percent battery life in just 1 hour and 31 minutes. That's the same time it takes the Galaxy S7 to fully recharge, while the Google Pixel takes longer and the iPhone 7 is "depressingly slow." The report points out that the Galaxy A5 (2017) and the Galaxy S7 can fully charge so fast because Samsung uses a Fast Adaptive Charger than can push up to 15 watts to the smartphone, thus reducing he charging time. Overall, the new-generation Galaxy A5 is a beastly phone in terms of battery life, but let's not forget that it has lower specs than flagship smartphones. Higher-resolution displays and other higher-end specs take a greater toll on battery performance, so we can't expect the QHD Galaxy S7, for instance, to last as long as the full HD Galaxy A5. If battery life is a crucial factor when choosing a smartphone, however, the Galaxy A5 (2017) seems like a good choice.

How To Make The Most Of Valentine’s Day With Android For Couples Telegram App Now Available On Android Wear 2.0 February 10, 2017 - Written By Dominik Bosnjak The Telegram instant messaging (IM) app is now available on Android Wear 2.0, its developers announced on Thursday. The announcement came shortly after Google announced the launch of Android Wear 2.0 which supports standalone apps. As it turns out, the developers behind Telegram already made one such app which is now available for download from the Google Play Store free of charge. As expected, the Android Wear version of Telegram allows users to browse their chat history and quickly reply to messages with either voice or text. The app supports both emojis and stickers and allows people to create new chat groups directly from their watch. The new version of Telegram started rolling out yesterday and should already be available to all users who own a device running Android Wear 2.0. Furthermore, the new version of Telegram also supports themes which currently seem really basic but might evolve into something more in the future. On a related note, the company announced that themes will also find their way to the Telegram Android app shortly, but didn’t provide a specific timeline for the inclusion of that feature. The gallery below shows some screenshots of Telegram for Android Wear 2.0. Generally speaking, the app seems to feature a clean, intuitive user interface that’s in line with Google’s Material Design guidelines. While some users may not find the idea of using an IM app on their smartwatch too appealing, the fact that Telegram supports voice replies and handwriting recognition should still ensure that the Android Wear version of the app is as intuitive as possible. Not surprisingly, the app also supports third-party keyboards and allows you to draw emojis on your watch. Overall, most Telegram users will likely find the new version of the app useful, though it’s availability is still limited seeing how Android Wear 2.0 is currently only available on the LG Watch Sport and the LG Watch Style. Nevertheless, more Android Wear devices are scheduled to be updated to Android Wear 2.0 in the coming weeks. In the meantime, you can always use the mobile version of the app that is still receiving updates on a regular basis.

Or when you feel like a parachute riding into a head wind as you struggle your way home on your commute back from work. One of these questions that may be running through your head is ‘Is cycling good for me?’ To put it simply: yes it is, but there are many reasons that you’ve possibly taken for granted or perhaps never even knew when you hit the road. Physical health The main and perhaps most obvious reason for why cycling is good for you is the physical benefits it can bring. Improving your heart health, boosting your aerobic fitness and increasing weight loss are just a few consequences of consistent cycling training. Add all these benefits together and it not only results in a healthier lifestyle but increases the chances of you living for longer as well. >>> ‘Why do cyclists wear lycra?’ – you asked Google and we’ve got the answer Social factor Cycling is a great way to connect with other people Despite being recognised as an individual sport, cycling is a great way to improve your social life. Whether this is heading out for a ride with your friends, joining a local cycling club or a chain gang. This can even lead to you heading abroad to test yourself on foreign terrains on training camps and cycling holidays. No matter what time of year we can always benefit from a little bit of sunshine and some guaranteed vitamin D. >>> ‘Why do cyclists ride in the middle of the road?’ – you asked Google, and we’ve got the answer Psychological wellbeing Cycling can help you clear your mind Despite the aforementioned nightmare scenarios of riding a bike, cycling can be an extremely pleasant activity the majority of time. Getting out and discovering new places, breathing in fresh air whilst riding through country lanes are just a couple of a multitude of factors that have seen many studies and surveys completed that confirm that cycling makes you happier. >>> It’s official: Cycling makes you happier Low injury risk There are a plethora of sports to choose from, but few carry the physiological benefits in comparison to the low injury risk factors that cycling brings. Compared to high impact sports such as running, or high contact sports such as football and rugby, cycling has a much lower risk of causing bodily damage that can occur from these other sports. Obviously, the odd bump and bruise may happen now and then if you aren’t too careful but, in terms of overuse or accidental injuries the numbers are very low. >>> ‘Why is my bike so slow?’ – you asked Google, and we’ve got the answer Improve your sex life That’s right, cycling can improve your sex life. A number of studies have shown how sports and physical activity such as cycling can lead to an increased confidence, boosted sex drive and even improved sexual satisfaction in the moment itself! That’s without even mentioning your improved physique you will have on show from the countless hours you would have put in to sculpting your glute, quad and calf muscles. >>> ‘Why do cyclists ride side by side?’ – you asked Google, and we’ve got the answer Myth busting: Why cycling isn’t good for you There are several stories of cycling and the dangers it can bring. However, if you push aside the attention grabbing headlines it isn’t as bad as first reported or even sometimes completely false. One of the main issues most people believe cycling is bad for you are the dangers from cycling on the road. One of these hard facts is that cyclist are 11 times more likely to be involved in a fatal accident compared to drivers per mile driven or ridden. However, when you add up the miles ridden and driven per person, the chances of being a fatality are just as likely cycling, driving or even walking, due to the greater amount of miles racked up by motorists. Another myth links back to our last point about sexual wellbeing. It is thought that countless hours sitting on a saddle can lead to numbness, discomfort and permanent physical damage. However, studies into this phenomenon are limited with experts still believing the benefits of cycling far outweigh the negatives that the sport may bring. 3T Orbis II C35 Pro Clincher Wheelset Performance Wheels Wiggle £200.00 Save 60.0% Buy Now De Marchi Windproof Jacket 2 AW16 Chain Reaction Cycles £88.99 Save 53.2% Buy Now POC Octal Raceday Road Helmet Road Helmets Wiggle £147.98 Save 24.1% Buy Now Most read this week Comment: Nothing is off-limits in Daily Mail’s latest rant against cyclists Chris Froome: ‘Ian Stannard is an absolute beast!’ Tour de France stage winner Serge Baguet dies, aged 47 Tour of Britain 2017 route: what we know so far Disc brakes now safe?

 Google reshuffles its music products BI Intelligence Feb. 10, 2017, 10:12 AM 1,064 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also YouTube ups its live-streaming game Mobile and YouTube drive Alphabet's 4Q growth YouTube highlights the importance of the TV screen This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Digital Media Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. The product teams for YouTube Music and Google Play Music are being combined into a single unit, The Verge reports, in a hint that Google plans to fuse the two music services into a single app. For the moment, the apps will continue to operate independently, but an eventual combination (if it occurs) would solidify Google's music offering to consumers.  Right now, YouTube Music and Google Play Music are separate but complementary apps: YouTube Music is a streaming app recreates the listening experience on YouTube into a standalone audio-only app. It’s built around playlists, personalized stations and a near endless catalog of songs. Another (and perhaps more specific) way to think about YouTube Music is as the music component of YouTube Red minus the price and perks of a paid subscription. Google Play Music is both a music streaming service and a cloud-based music locker where users can upload and store songs from their personal catalogs. It has a streaming catalog of over 30 million songs and lets users save up to 50,000 songs from their own collection on the app. It’s tied into the Google Play app store, where users buy and download their desired songs. YouTube Red, meanwhile, is the company’s paid subscription service. At $9.99 a month, it gives users ad-free access to YouTube music and video, and the ability to play content offline and in the background while the screen is off or when running another app. A subscription to YouTube Red gives users full access to both YouTube Music and Google Play Music.  But this the latest sign that YouTube Music and Google Play Music are better off as one. Google already combined the business development teams from both apps last year. Driven by an urge to simplify its relationship with the music industry, the move streamlined Google’s negotiations with music copyright holders — publishers, labels, and artists — by consolidating Google’s music partnerships to a single point of contact. And combining the apps’ product teams is another indication that running Google Play Music and YouTube Music separately doesn’t make business sense. Initially, YouTube Music was seen as a way to sell more songs and memberships on Google Play Music, but perhaps these apps aren’t as differentiated and complementary as Google had envisioned. Merging YouTube Music and Google Play Store could benefit Google in several ways: Competition. Combining the best of YouTube Music and Google Play Store into one app likely lead to a more competitive service. It would eliminate having to switch between the two apps (as well as any consumer confusion about how these apps are different in the first place). Staying competitive is key in a music space that’s becoming increasingly crowded. Subscriptions. Similar to the point above, combining the two apps would provide a more cohesive and compelling free offering underneath YouTube Red, which would act as a stronger conduit to then funnel users into paying Red members. YouTube needs to convert 4% of its one billion monthly user base to match Spotify’s number of paid subscribers. Acquisitions. Simplifying the organizational structure of Google’s music services clears the course for Google to go and make acquisitions in this space because it would make any future product integrations — particularly big ones — much easier to do. Earlier this year, Google was rumored to be “very interested” in buying SoundCloud for $500 million.

But even with premium models, expanding beyond US schools won't be easy. Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here NEW YORK: The Google Chromebook, a type of stripped-down laptop, isn't a practical mobile device for many people _ mostly because it basically turns into an expensive paperweight whenever it can't find a Wi-Fi connection. Yet Chromebooks have defied expectations and made major inroads in an unexpected environment _ US schools. In retrospect, that shouldn't be too surprising. Chromebooks are cheap and easy to manage, making them popular with budget-constrained schools with limited tech-support staff. And Wi-Fi is now common enough in US schools and homes to make an internet-dependent device practical for students. Google doesn't want to stop there. It's releasing new models in partnership with Samsung that are designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers. They have several tablet-like features, including a stylus, touch controls and a 360-degree hinge that allows you to turn the screen face-up. One starts selling Sunday for $449; a more powerful version comes out in April for $100 more. Google and its manufacturing partners are trying to shed the Chromebook's perception as underperforming budget devices. But even with premium models, expanding beyond US schools won't be easy. CHROMEBOOKS GET SCHOOLED For personal computers and tablets, Chromebook's share of the US education market was 49 percent last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2013, according to IDC figures released this week. But education accounts for just 14 percent of the 110 million devices shipped in the US last year _ and Chromebooks make up just 9 percent of that broader total. Their numbers are also low abroad, even in schools. The Chromebook's popularity in US education is also largely limited to grades K-12, analysts say. Macs and Windows laptops are still dominant on college campuses. ROUGH START Chromebooks use a lightweight operating system designed to get people online faster, without having to wait around for the computer to start up. Much of the heavy lifting on Chromebooks gets done on Google's remote servers, so Chromebooks themselves don't need fast chips or lots of storage. Early on, though, that made Chromebooks seem cheap and underpowered, which "soured consumer expectations right off the bat," IDC analyst Linn Huang said. Online storage for photos and documents online was much less common in 2011 when Chromebooks launched, so their limited local storage was initially unappealing. And the few apps available for Chromebooks didn't work offline, at least at the time. DIFFERING NEEDS But what constrains consumers can actually be liberating in education. Most kids don't need laptops on the bus or other locations where they can't connect to Wi-Fi. And they don't miss business software like Microsoft Office; Google's online apps for documents and spreadsheets do just fine for homework. "What surprised us was how quickly it took off in education," said Kan Liu, who oversees Chromebooks at Google. Apple's iPad was hot at the time, but Google sold the Chromebook on convenience. They're easier for classrooms to share; just sign in with a Google account, and a student's apps and documents instantly appear. Teachers also have online tools to lock down what apps and sites students can use. And with models available for less than $200, schools can get a few Chromebooks for the price of an iPad or a rival laptop. "It allows us to put more devices in students' hands," said Aaron Slutsky, chief technology officer for McDowell County Schools in North Carolina. FAR FROM UNIVERSAL But Chromebook's success story in schools is largely an American one, and it's likely to stay that way. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa notes that Chromebooks are useless in China because the device depends on Google services that aren't available there. And in emerging countries, where a budget laptop would be ideal, she said internet access isn't reliable enough. Even in the US, the iPad is better for many creative tasks such as recording and editing movies. Students studying engineering, robotics and graphics won't be able to use Chromebooks to run the kind of specialized software that's available for Macs and Windows laptops. "But that's not needed for 98 percent of our students," said Tracy Dabbs, coordinator of technology and innovation at the Burlington-Edison School District near Seattle. Many school districts limit Apple and Windows computers for the students who specifically need them, then provide Chromebooks for the rest. McDowell County, for instance, has 5,500 Chromebooks, 1,200 iPads _ and only 100 Macs and 200 Windows PCs. RIVALS STAGE A COMEBACK Last year, Apple gave iPads in schools some Chromebook-like features unavailable to the general public. That includes ways to let multiple people use a single tablet and management tools for tech-support staff. A new Classroom app lets teachers control what apps students run and track their progress. Apple also provides classroom tools for teachers and students. Free e-books offer teachers step-by-step guides on using iPad apps and curriculum suggestions for everyday subjects. A separate app lets kids learn programming using the same language developers use to build iPad apps. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced last month new online apps and management tools for schools, along with Windows PCs priced similarly to Chromebooks. BEYOND SCHOOLS Huang said some businesses are giving Chromebooks a second look, especially in retail, banking and other settings where people share computers. But in many offices, the lack of business software such as Office is a major hurdle. Google's alternative lacks many advanced capabilities found in Office, and habits are hard to change. Google is trying to make Chromebooks more palatable by letting them run Android apps designed for phones and tablets. It's testing this capability on a handful of Chromebook models, including the new ones from Samsung. That makes it possible to install Office, Adobe Photoshop and many apps on a Chromebook, though these tablet versions have limited features compared with versions for Macs or Windows laptops.

SUBSCRIBE Searchmetrics e-commerce ranking factors study says easy e-commerce sites rank higher in Google Want to know what makes an e-commerce site rank well in Google? This study explores those ranking signals. Barry Schwartz on February 10, 2017 at 9:12 am More Searchmetrics has published a retail-specific Google ranking factors document that looks at the top-ranking e-commerce sites and tries to analyze what factors make them rank higher in Google than others. This is similar to their general rankings factor study, but this one focuses on the retail sector. Here are the main takeaways from the study, but it is worth downloading the full study over here. Only 3 percent of the top 10 e-commerce pages have Google AdSense or Adlinks on the pages. The e-commerce websites among the top 20 search results have less than a third as many social signals as the overall average. The file size of e-commerce pages in the top 10 is more than 30 percent larger than the average file size across all sectors. The number of interactive elements on high-ranking e-commerce websites is almost 40 percent higher than in [Searchmetrics’] benchmark analysis. Across the top 10 Google positions, e-commerce pages have, on average, 70 percent more bullets per list than the overall benchmark. In e-commerce, URLs on the first page of the Google search results have 70 percent more internal links than the overall benchmark. Across the top 20 of Google’s search results, well over half of e-commerce pages have an online store above the fold. This is more than double the overall average. E-commerce pages in the top 10 almost all (99.9 percent) have the TLD .com. Video plays a less significant role in e-commerce than for websites in general. Only 35 percent of e-commerce pages in the top 10 have embedded videos. The word count for e-commerce URLs in the top 10 is around 25 percent higher than the overall average. The table below summarizes the percentage differences between the top 10 averages for e-commerce pages and the benchmark average values from the general ranking factors. The following infographic shows the rank correlations for all ranking factors covered in this white paper and compares these with the correlations from the general ranking factor analysis. Daniel Furch, head of content at Searchmetrics, said, “Most marketers appreciate that you need to create relevant, high quality content to perform well in search, but our latest study highlights that online retail and ecommerce marketers must also pay close attention to a variety of retail-specific factors. … This includes considerations such as ensuring content is structured with bullet points so that product details can be more easily scanned by visitors; making the online checkout section easily visible without scrolling; and — in most cases — avoiding ads on the page.” You can download the full white paper over here.

SUBSCRIBE The impact (and lack thereof) of Google’s mobile popup algorithm Back in August 2016, Google warned that it would be releasing an algorithm to crack down on interstitials on mobile pages. Now that the update has been live for a month, columnist Glenn Gabe shares his findings on the impact. Glenn Gabe on February 10, 2017 at 10:16 am More It’s not often that Google announces an algorithm update in advance. But when they do, not only can webmasters prepare for that update, we can also track its rollout once Google pulls the trigger. That provides a rare opportunity to gauge the impact of the algorithm update and determine what its effects are. That’s exactly what I’ve been doing since January 10, 2017. In August of 2016, Google announced that they would be rolling out an update on January 10, 2017, that could impact URLs employing intrusive mobile popups or interstitials. For example, if a URL presented an interstitial that covered a substantial part of the content, then that URL could be demoted in the mobile search results. The web as a whole cheered, as many users were extremely frustrated by aggressive mobile popups. So, as January approached, many SEOs, webmasters and business owners wondered what the actual impact would be. Would there be mass casualties, minor bumps in the algorithmic road or something in between? Based on Google’s announcement, you would think that sites employing intrusive popups or interstitials would have gotten smoked by the algorithm. That would make sense, but when you’re dealing in an algorithmic world, the devil is in the details. Preparing for the mobile popup algorithm As the rollout neared, I had many questions. Would the update actually work? How extreme would it be? Would there be loopholes? How would it impact branded versus non-branded queries? Would large-scale sites be impacted as much as smaller sites? And so on and so forth. That’s why I prepared for the update by collecting as many sites using mobile popups or interstitials as possible. My goal was to benchmark those sites and then gauge the impact as the mobile popup algorithm rolled out. I’m now tracking close to 70 domains on my mobile popup list — and those sites are across verticals, including news publishers, entertainment, sports, e-commerce retailers, bloggers, music and more. Starting on January 10, I began checking my list twice per day to see which sites were still breaking the rules and which ones weren’t. And for the ones breaking the new Google mobile popup law, how much negative impact would they see? Would they see any impact at all? My travels along the popup algorithm trail My research took me across many sites, both large and small, across many categories and locations. It was fascinating to see which sites raised the white flag and stopped using popups or interstitials and which ones stood their ground and kept them. It was also eye-opening to analyze the various ways websites employed popups and interstitials in this new world (if they kept them). It was enlightening, to say the least. And of course, I was able to see many different types of ads and interstitials, including benign newsletter signups, aggressive ads that take over your screen, autoplay video in popups, broken ads in popups, and even malware and malicious downloads from ads in popups. There were times I felt like I needed battle armor while visiting some sites. Credit: Giphy Below, I’ll cover the impact, the non-impact, the natural side effects of a preannounced Google algorithm update, examples of popups and interstitials, and other interesting notes. So join me on a ride through mobile popup land. January 10, 2017: The rollout begins When the rollout began, I was excited to check my list and determine if there was any impact. As you can guess, there wasn’t much to report on the first day. The algorithm had to fully roll out, so I began checking my list twice per day to gauge the impact. And as I was checking the mobile SERPs, I ended up finding even more sites using mobile popups and interstitials. So my list was naturally growing as time went on. On January 12, I noticed what I believed were the first signs of impact, and I wrote a post to document my findings. My plan was to keep adding findings to that post as I came across more and more impact. Well, that didn’t turn out very well. After some initial movement, there seemed to be very little impact (if any at all). I kept updating my post with disclaimers about the lack of impact I was seeing. I was floored. I thought for sure the domains I was tracking would see some movement, but I was wrong. I checked twice per day, only to see many of the URLs from those domains ranking exactly where they did prior to the rollout. As of today, I’m still not seeing widespread impact. Again, many of the URLs across the domains I’m tracking are ranking exactly where they did prior to the rollout of the mobile popup algorithm. Therefore, I’m officially calling the mobile popup algorithm a dud. Sure, that can change if Google strengthens the algorithm or refines it, but for now, it’s not doing very much. Examples of popups and interstitials still in use You might be wondering what I’m seeing when checking sites. Well, I’ve seen it all since January 10: newsletter signups, popups on scroll, delayed popups, multi-ad interstitials, autoplay video, broken popups, malware, malicious downloads, multiple popups on one page, and so on. Without revealing the sites, here is a potpourri of popups and interstitials I have come across during my travels. These are all from URLs that currently rank highly for competitive keywords — and ranked there before the algorithm update rolled out. Also, the desktop and mobile rankings are equivalent. In other words, I’m not seeing a drop in the mobile SERPs when compared to desktop, which would happen if the mobile popup algorithm were impacting rankings. I’ll see you on the other side. That’s where I’ll cover the true impact of the mobile popup algorithm — and it might not be what you’re thinking. And many more… The true impact of the mobile popup algorithm Well, the true impact has nothing to do with mobile rankings being impacted, a slide in mobile traffic or anything related to SEO. Instead, it has everything to do with the reaction of publishers to the news that the algorithm was going to roll out. For example, many publishers removed mobile popups and interstitials as January 10, 2017, approached. They simply didn’t want to get hit or test the algorithmic waters. I saw this a lot as I was collecting sites that were employing mobile popups. This also included sites removing the popups after January 10. Not every company knew about the algorithm update, so some were late to the game. My guess is that the algorithm got on their radar based on news of the rollout, so those publishers had a knee-jerk reaction and simply removed their popups without gauging the actual impact. They basically trusted that the mobile popup algorithm was working without evidence of it actually working. And I get that. If you’re not neck-deep in SEO, you might not be familiar with the gray area of algorithms, and you might not know that some algorithm updates simply don’t work as expected. For those people, they just knew it was rolling out, that it could potentially negatively impact their rankings and traffic, and they pulled the popups and interstitials from their sites. But like I said earlier, the devil is in the details. Again, I’m not seeing any widespread impact from the mobile popup algorithm as I write this post. High risk, high reward: Will Google turn up the dial? And here’s the rub. The publishers I mentioned earlier that stood their ground and refused to remove their mobile popups and interstitials have braved the mighty tsunami that never arrived. They stood on the beach facing a powerful surge of water that would surely suck the mobile life out of their sites… and nothing happened. But that’s for now. Google can absolutely turn up the dial and strengthen the mobile popup algorithm at any time. And if they do, then those sites using mobile popups or interstitials could get smoked. But that’s a big could. Now, I’m not saying mobile popups are a good thing. I actually can’t stand most of them, and users overall hate them. That should be enough to rid them from the web, but they do work conversion-wise (unfortunately). So, we have a situation where an algorithm that should impact URLs employing mobile popups is not living up to expectations, and a marketing tactic that drives conversion was removed from many sites. I don’t know where we go from here, but I fear more sites will test the algorithmic waters and add those popups back. And it’s hard to blame them. So, based on what I explained in this post, I’ll provide some closing points below. Key points Although there hasn’t been widespread impact yet, Google can turn up the dial at any time. I know many people are still hoping that happens; and if it does, sites using mobile popups or interstitials can get hit. Remember, high risk, high reward. Publishers are still figuring out ways to push the envelope with mobile popups in order to determine which formats and techniques will get hit and which ones won’t. But based on my research, there’s very little negative impact overall so far. I recommend watching my initial post for more updates. Never simply take Google’s word for it. Track and test updates for yourself. I’m glad I decided to gather close to 70 sites using mobile popups and interstitials. That enabled me to test how strong the algorithm was and if it was doing what it was supposed to do. Mobile popups and interstitials are horrible user experience-wise, but they perform well conversion-wise. Based on the lack of impact from the mobile popup algorithm, I fear we will see more sites testing the waters and adding them back. It pains me to say that… but the lack of impact is clear. Summary: The waiting continues When January 10 arrived, I was eager to gauge the impact of the mobile popup algorithm. But what I wasn’t prepared for was to see very little happen. And that’s exactly what occurred while checking many sites still using mobile popups and interstitials. Moving forward, keep an eye on my Twitter feed and my original findings post. I will keep checking my list, and checking it twice, in order to see if the mobile popup algorithm is being naughty or nice.

(Google) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Machines with Brains February 09, 2017 Science fiction tells us one day we’ll talk to our phones and computers like they’re people, as suggested in movies like Her and 2001: A Space Odyssey. But we’re now facing a different reality: Our digital lives aren’t managed by one entity, but rather a collection of AIs that gather information about how we type, what kind of media we like to see, and what we should be doing throughout the day. Right now, a lot of these algorithms require too much computing power to run on phones and other smart devices—that’s part of the reason why the cloud has been so revolutionary. But a coming wave of advances in AI research and deployment will bring algorithms that require far less compute power, meaning we can carry them around on our smartphones, smartwatches, and smart belts, without sending personal information like texts back to the servers of Facebook and Google. This technology could allow a fresh start for privacy within messaging apps, especially now that users are beginning to understand the importance of end-to-end encryption on their personal messages. Today, Google is announcing one such optimization—the Smart Reply feature found in its popular Inbox app is coming to the new Android Wear 2.0 (a smartphone), and will be able to run locally on any application on the device. That means suggestions will populate faster, but more important, the data about what you type will never leave your device. (The algorithms are built and trained in the cloud, however.) To make this on-device prediction possible, Google researchers dumbed down how the algorithm sees each message. In the full Smart Reply feature, each snippet of text is analyzed and turned into a complex string of numbers that indicates information about each word and how the words work together as a phrase. On the watch Google uses a much simpler code, consisting of only 8 bits, or 1’s and 0’s. Similar messages are grouped together (like “How are you” “how are you doing”), making far fewer kinds of messages that the watch needs to remember. This simplification, along with a few other tweaks, led to the algorithm requiring 100x less compute power, according to a Google spokesman, which made it possible to bring Smart Reply to the Wear 2.0. When tested by humans against the original Smart Reply feature, Google found that the new suggested messages were “surprisingly more rich and diverse,” its spokesman said. Text to bits in the new Smart Reply. (Google) Other tech companies like Facebook are also thinking about this problem, but from a different angle. The way cloud-based artificial intelligence algorithms work today is incompatible with any strong encryption—for the AI to decrypt the message, analyze it, and encrypt it again would cause a host of vulnerabilities and defeat the point of encrypting it in the first place. The AI that Facebook is researching to someday deploy in Messenger is text analysis that can suggest actions (like calling an Uber or buying dinner) based on your conversations with others. When asked by Quartz about ensuring security while providing these features, Facebook’s director of applied machine learning, Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, said that the solution would probably be personal AIs that live inside each user’s app on their phone. “The answer is going to be bringing AI to run locally on your phone, and that’s an active area of research,” Candela said, noting that Facebook was already working on this for its AI camera filters, which run without connecting to the cloud. Facebook has long been motivated to streamline its AI in the interest of speed: Most people use the social network on mobile devices, and having phones continuously pinging Facebook servers takes time and data, and depends on signal strength. Last October, chief product officer Geoffrey Fowler showed off the AI system within Facebook’s mobile app, called Caffe2Go, and its ability to process real-time, Snapchat-like camera filters.

By Maghan McDowell on February 10, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Paul Dillinger, VP of global innovation, Levi Strauss & Co Misha Vladimirskiy SAN FRANCISCO — Google and Levi’s aren’t the most obvious of partners, but their coming together is the stuff of which Silicon Valley stories are made. As Paul Dillinger, vice president of global innovation at Levi Strauss & Co., tells it, two-and-a-half years ago, Levi’s president James Curleigh sat down to dinner with Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects group. The group’s purview was to “make epic stuff,” and part of that was taking on what a successful wearable looked like. So they reached out to a number of companies, wondering what could be done with Levi’s, which came to prominence during the city’s original gold rush 150 years before Google tapped into tech gold just south of San Francisco. When Dillinger heard about a possible project to inject apparel with an interactive capability, he was not initially into the idea. “Why would I take on a challenge this difficult?” Dillinger wondered. They’re both two very big companies that might not naturally be adept at collaboration. He noted that Google was about radical change and inventing the future, unencumbered by supply chains, while Levi’s “predicates its value on six-month radical change — whether it’s jeggings or a skinny jean — within a normal set of parameters,” from a supply-chain standpoint. But then as Dillinger was riding his bike through the city, he landed on a use case that made sense: The result is Levi’s Commuter Trucker Jacket, which uses interactive fiber using Google’s Jacquard technology and is made to be used by urban cyclists. Wearers can touch the fabric on the sleeve to perform functions on their smart phone, such as controlling music or silencing calls. The jacket is expected to become available for consumer demos in March. Dillinger said it’s one example of a way to make wearable tech usable. “You might not go to Google for a great pair of sunglasses, but you’ll go to Levi’s for a great jean jacket, so you should go to the partner who will offer the form part that will enhance the opportunity you have with technology,” Dillinger said. He added that a successful wearable might not look like an unknown thing, and that the entirely familiar — like a jean jacket — might be a better starting point. The key factor, he said, is that to avoid being just a gadget, wearable tech must align with customer needs. “The brands understand those the best — not the creators in the lab,” he said. Dillinger was speaking at a panel hosted at the Macy’s Fashion Incubator here, along with Andrew Lutjens, fashion wearables business strategist at Intel, and Nicole Mason, director of digital media and marketing at macys.com, about working on useful fashion and technology projects. Lutjens emphasized the need for the designers to create the products, while Intel supplied the technology inside. “Intel is all about partnerships,” Lutjens said. “We need brands to bring product to market. We are the experts when it comes to tech, but we rely on brand partners.” To that end, Intel recently challenged the 10 designers in the CFDA’s Vogue Fashion Fund incubator to use the Intel Curie chip in a design. Mason described how Macy’s worked with Alibaba’s TMall to create a virtual reality shopping experience in the store’s Herald Square location, and an artificially intelligent app with IBM’s Watson to make a store-specific directory. Going forward, she predicted chatbots will one day replace apps — Macy’s has one with Facebook Messenger — and that thanks to augmented reality and VR, customers will be able to have a full, in-store shopping experience without leaving home. Dillinger said wearables will fuel a return to bricks-and-mortar shopping as “no amount of explanation will get you the same experience. When everything you buy can do something, we finally have that one thing to fight against fast fashion. Bricks-and-mortar will be the place you go to discover this new thing.” You're missing something!

To add to tracking organic keywords, there’s social media monitoring that entered the marketers’ lives, becoming common practice in no time. And again, there are tools to help with actual social listening. However, what some marketers don’t know is what keywords they should actually be tracking, both organically and in social media. Fortunately, we’re here to help you answer that question. In this post, we’ll explain the top types of keywords every brand, business, or website owner in general should be monitoring if they want to outrank their competitors and grow brand awareness. Branded keywords The first, and most important keywords you should be monitoring are your branded keywords. These are the keywords that are directly associated with your brand. They can range from the name of your company, names of your unique products or services, and names of key people in your company if they have personal websites or personal brands of their own. Why would you want to see the rankings of these keywords? Simple. Because if you notice that your own brand keywords have dropped in rankings, then there is definitely an SEO problem that needs to be addressed. You can use the full SEO PowerSuite tool set to analyze your on-site and off-site SEO to see what may have triggered an algorithmic drop in rankings or a manual penalty. Competitor’s branded keywords The next set of keywords you should be monitoring are your competitor’s branded keywords. Again, this would be the name of their company, names of their unique products or services, and names of key people in their company if they have personal websites or personal brands of their own. Why would you want to see the rankings of these keywords? Simple. Because if you notice that your competitor’s brand keywords have dropped in rankings, then there are two things that could be happening. Your competitor could be getting penalized, which means it might be a great time to put up a Google AdWords ad that comes up when someone searches for your competitor by name (a little grey-hat tactic, but it happens). This would allow your brand to come up if competitor doesn’t! This can be helpful if your competitor has gone out of business, stopped carrying a product that you still carry, or similar. Commercial keywords Last, but not least, you have to be tracking your commercial keywords. These are the keyword phrases that you think your customers are searching to find your business in order to make a purchase. The ones you would research with simple tools like Google AdWords Keyword Planner or advanced tools like Rank Tracker to see which had the best search volume. For example, a marketing agency would have commercial keywords like SEO services, link building services, content marketing services, social media services, and so forth. The difference between a commercial and informational keyword? Someone searching for link building services could be searching for someone to hire to do link building. Someone searching for link building could be searching for link building tips, not someone to hire. As a business, you want to monitor the keywords that are driving your customers. Not people who just want information. With one exception… Informational keywords If you go into your Google Analytics and look at the Landing Pages report under your landing pages, you will find that some landing pages on your website convert to customers. And some of those landing pages may be your blog posts. In which case, you may want to monitor the rankings of the informational keywords that led readers to blog posts that convert well. Using the marketing agency example again, they would want to monitor informational keywords  like link building if their posts on link building tended to drive the most leads to their business. They would do this to ensure that their blog content on link building was consistently ranking well and moving up in rankings if possible. Also be sure to expand your visibility by using information keywords for videos, podcasts, live Facebook videos, and other types of content that your target audience may like on networks and platforms that your customers use most. This will give you the best possible chance of reaching the most customers possible for your business via informative content that should be able to convert. Beyond keyword monitoring for rankings In addition to monitoring the above keywords in terms of rankings, you should also monitor the above and other keyword types using web and social mention monitoring tools like Awario. This will allow you to a wide range of tasks. For example, if a brand keyword is mentioned, you may have a chance to use it as a testimonial (if it’s a positive mention) or as a chance for reputation management (if it’s a negative mention). If a competitor keyword is mentioned, you may have a chance to steal a customer (if it’s a negative mention). If commercial keywords are mentioned, you may have a chance to find and answer questions from potential customers. And convert them if you’re lucky! Also, if you notice a particular keyword (branded, competition, or commercial) is being mentioned at a higher rate, you may find that can turn into an opportunity to create content that would attract trending searchers about your brand, your competition (if it’s negative news you can use to drive customers to your product or service), or your commercial keywords. This could help attract new customers to your website if published in a timely manner. In conclusion As you can see, monitoring keywords is important. Not just for rankings to ensure that your SEO is working, but also for making sure that you can capitalize on any opportunities for testimonials, customers service, reputation management, and getting customers. So don’t just think about your own rankings. Think rankings and beyond!

After what seemed like an eternity of waiting, Google’s beloved Pixel XL phablet is finally available to order again from Google’s online store. The bad news is that most Pixel XL models still won’t ship for several weeks, but there actually is one model that is shipping immediately — or at least, there was at the time of this writing. As pent-up as demand is right now for the Pixel XL, there’s no telling how long Google will manage to keep it in stock. Don't Miss: Leaked photos show us how stunning Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design will be First things first: if you really want a Pixel XL and you can’t live without the phone for one more minute, you can always get one at any time on Amazon with free Prime shipping. The catch — you knew there had to be a catch — is that you’ll need to pay a premium for the luxury of avoiding the wait from the Google Store. Even the hard-to-find “Really Blue” model is in stock right now on Amazon. If you don’t want to pay a premium and you don’t mind waiting anywhere from 3 weeks to a month and a half for your shiny new phablet, then head on over to the Pixel page on the Google Store right now. At the time of this writing orders placed for the 32GB Pixel XL in Quite Black were shipping immediately. Black is arguably the sleekest color for the Pixel XL, so it’s likely that Google ramped up production of that model first. As for all the other color and size options, the soonest you’ll get one is 3 to 4 weeks from now. Here’s a full breakdown of the different models and shipping quotes: Google Pixel XL – Quite Black – 32GB: Shipping now Google Pixel XL – Quite Black – 128GB: 3-4 weeks Google Pixel XL – Very Silver – 32GB: 6-7 weeks Google Pixel XL – Very Silver – 128GB: Out of stock Google Pixel XL – Really Blue – 32GB: Out of stock Google Pixel XL – Really Blue – 128GB: Out of stock For each of the models that are currently out of stock, Google gives you the option to enter your email to be notified when inventory is replenished. Or, should we say, if inventory is replenished.

Forums Join   Google Fiber San Antonio Build Stuck in Neutral by Karl Bode Friday Feb 10 2017 08:30 EST Google Fiber paused its San Antonio build a few weeks ago after city residents complained about the placement of the "fiber huts" needed to drive the service. Seventeen huts were planned for San Antonio city-owned property, including six city parks, five fire stations, three vacant residential properties, two libraries and one police station. But many locals consider the 32 by 50 foot fenced in area and structure to be eyesores, and have been pressuring Google and the city to reconsider the location of several of the units. Most of the complaints revolve around the structures being placed in parks. Other complaints focus on the fact that Google Fiber didn't adequately communicate where the builds would occur. After pausing deployment a few weeks ago, city residents and leaders say they still haven't heard anything from Google Fiber. "Google, they're two to three weeks out --they feel-- before they talk to us. What we do know is they're reevaluating the whole network here in San Antonio," said Deputy San Antonio City Manager Peter Zanoni at a January 18 council briefing.

Numerous reports have suggested several key Alphabet executives have grown tired of the high cost and slow pace of their fiber deployments, and are eager to instead pivot to next-generation wireless. tags: Fiber · business · alternatives · bandwidth · Google · Google Fiber · gigabit News Jump Sprint's Owner Continues to Talk Sale or T-Mobile Merger AT&T Workers Authorize Strike as Contract Standoff LoomsForum Topic: Tracking the Progress of Altice's Fiber BuildVerizon Disputes Study Claiming T-Mobile's Gaining GroundFriday Morning LinksCharter Sued For Post Merger Billing Screw UpsWeekend Open Thread!Comcast Told to Stop Lying About 'Fastest Internet' Ad ClaimsAs T-Mobile Network Improves, Verizon Needs To Stop BullshittingAT&T Plans 5G Wireless Tests at 3.7-4.2 GHz And Above----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 34 comments batterup I Can Not Tell A Lie.

However, what was a bit surprising was the number of products revealed that work with Amazon’s Alexa Voice Services. Ford’s new infotainment center powered by Amazon’s Alexa Considering that Google has kept Google Assistant tied to just a few products, this has opened the door for Amazon to take a commanding lead in the space. We saw Alexa integration in everything from refrigerators to our car infotainment centers, but also saw an announcement from Huawei regarding Alexa integration with the Mate 9. That may have been the most surprising news of all, considering the Mate 9 will be the first smartphone that includes Amazon Alexa as an option, versus using Google’s own features. Also, since Google Assistant hasn’t been opened to any smartphones other than the Pixel and Pixel XL, this may be the jump start that Amazon needed. Moving into the smartphone market is definitely something that could have been foreseen for Amazon, but it took the company time to perfect Alexa before making the move. Although the Mate 9 was recently released in the US, it’s not available through any US carriers, and can only be purchased at its full retail price of $599. This limits the device from being in the hands of more users, however, it’s a foot in the door for a company trying to make a name for itself. Combined with the new partnership with Amazon, it’s likely that we may see a more conscientious approach to future Huawei smartphones released in the US. There is also something important to remember. Since the Mate 9 will be the first smartphone with Alexa, there will likely be many bugs attached to the software update once it’s ready. Huawei and Amazon are swinging for the fences here, but the long fly ball could fall dead on the warning track, or it could be a huge swing-and-a-miss. Some reports are stating that Google’s decision to give its own hardware the go ahead before any other devices could come back to bite them. However, it’s also important to note that Assistant is beginning to roll out to more third-party devices, as was evidenced by the announcement of the new NVIDIA Shield TV. Now that Android Wear 2.0 is bringing Google Assistant to our wrists, that still leaves us wondering when we’ll see it on non-Pixel devices. However, we may not have to wait much longer as a rumor claims that the LG G6 will be the first to include Assistant after it’s announced at MWC 2017. We’re hoping that this will open the door for more OEMs to build Assistant into their software. However, we know that Samsung won’t be one of those OEMs, as it continues to develop its own option for the Samsung Galaxy S8. Naturally, Google wants to take baby steps to avoid a huge disaster or a bunch of bad press for lack of performance, but it may need to ramp things up a bit. If it doesn’t, the company may be playing catch up to Amazon for quite some time. Regardless of new smartphones and new gimmicks that we will be seeing over the next few months, one of the most exciting things to keep an eye out for in 2017 is this competition right here. Amazon versus Google as the two battle it out for control over our homes and now our personal assistants. local_offer    Amazon   Amazon Alexa   Amazon Echo   Google   Google Assistant   Google Home   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (9) stars Further Reading LG Watch Syle and Sport now available Pixel XL is back in stock Use your Pixel to control smart home devices These are the smartwatches being updated to Android Wear 2.0 Pixel's audio issues fixed stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertHow to Pixel-ize your phone closeHow to make any Android phone look like the Pixel Features like the Pixel Launcher, round icons, new nav bar buttons, and Google Assistant are still exclusive to the Pixel phones.

Baig , USA TODAY Published 9:00 a.m. ET Feb. 10, 2017 | Updated 18 hours ago Samsung Chromebook Pro (Photo: Google) 151 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEW YORK—The blurry line between Android and Chromebooks is about to get blurrier. Exhibit A arrives with the Samsung Chromebook Pro that I’ve been checking out for a couple of weeks. Google calls this upcoming $549 convertible laptop/tablet, and a sibling model, the $440 Chromebook Plus, the first Chromebooks to be “designed for Android apps.” Google worked closely with Samsung on the machines, which were initially showcased during last month’s CES trade show. These Samsung models come with an embedded pen that you can use, among other purposes, to write or draw directly on the screen, a first for the Chromebook ecosystem. Through “optical character recognition” technology or OCR, your handwritten text becomes searchable, at least if your jottings are reasonably legible. The biggest thing: the machines are integrated with the Google Play Store, which opens up Chromebooks to millions of Android apps. The Play Store on the Samsung Chromebook Pro  (Photo: Edward C. Baig) Indeed, Google has announced that the Play Store is coming to all 2017 Chromebooks, and it has been made available on models that have already been released, notably the Asus Chromebook Flip, Acer Chromebook R11 and Google’s own Chromebook Pixel dating back to 2015. The addition of Android is another way Google is trying to broaden the appeal of Chromebooks. The machines are popular in education and have made some inroads in business. Google cites an IDC report from last year showing that the Chromebooks overtook Macs as the second most popular PC operating system behind Windows. These cloud-based computers are kept secure through regular software updates from Google. In the past, Chromebooks have been severely hamstrung when you lack Internet connectivity. But there’s now a lot more you can do when you’re offline, whether watching movies, playing games or getting some work done. Android only adds to the offline opportunities. What's more, as a hybrid machine, Samsung and Google are invading territory occupied by Microsoft’s Surface machines, among other computers. Needs more polish. Unfortunately, my experience on the Samsung Chromebook Pro was far from smooth—at least for now. Sometimes the computer froze. Apps were occasionally fickle. With that observation, some key caveats: My test Samsung Pro is a pre-production unit running beta Chrome OS software. The Google Play Store on the Chromebook is still in beta too, a designation that is not expected to be lifted until the Chromebook Pro becomes available in late April. The less expensive Plus model goes on sale this Sunday, so keep your expectations in check on the Play Store experience. Curiously enough, the aluminum Pro I was issued is silver colored even though the Pros that go on sale will be black; the Plus models on the other hand are silver. The chief difference between the Plus and the Pro machines, other than price and color, is that the former is outfitted with an ARM mobile processor typically found in tablets and phones, while the Pro works off a laptop-class chipset from Intel. Otherwise they’re pretty much the same: very nice 12.3-inch Quad HD touch displays, 4 gigabytes of memory and 32GB of internal storage, microSD slot, two USB-C type ports, a 720p HD camera and a 360-degree hinge that lets you transform these 2.38 pound machines from laptop to tablet or back, or prop it up like a tent if say you’re watching a movie. There’s a USB-C charger, and Google is citing 9 hours of battery life for the Pro model but without final hardware and software I couldn’t evaluate that claim. The built-in stereo speakers are ho-hum. The Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus is the first to come with an embedded pen.  (Photo: Google) A versatile pen. The stylus reminds you of the S Pen on Samsung’s ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 and is similarly tucked away until you need it. The moment you pull it out of its slot, a menu appears on the screen with the various options for using the pen. You can use it as a laser pointer, for example, or in a mode that lets you magnify the screen. You can use it to take a picture of the screen or a portion of the screen. I suspect most of you though will use it to draw, write or take notes. I’m no artist but did my best van Gogh impression inside the ArtCanvas app I fetched from the Play Store. My handwritten notes were stored inside the cloud-based Google Keep app, and yes I had modest success searching for those notes after the fact. Given my lousy penmanship that was quite an accomplishment. I was certainly aware that I was writing on glass not paper, but I didn’t detect any latency and the experience seemed natural enough. Google applies machine learning and cloud services to analyze handwriting samples and predict where the pen is likely to go next. The pen itself is pressure sensitive and doesn’t require a battery. Samsung Chromebook Pro folded as a tablet  (Photo: Google) Through the Play Store I also had a go at apps ranging from games such as Gameloft’s Asphalt 8 Airborne and Deep Silver’s Sacred Legends--the graphics were impressive--to You Tube Kids, Duolingo and Evernote. One snag: for some reason I couldn’t play audio files in Evernote that I was able to play inside Evernote on a Mac. Oh, and I'd love to see the Google Assistant show up on the Chromebook; the AI-infused Assistant is not part of Google's launch plans. Samsung’s Chromebook Pro offers a lot of promise. But it needs the polish that will only presumably arrive when the hardware and software is finalized. Email: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter The bottom line Samsung Chromebook Pro $549, www.google.com/chromebook Pro. Well-built hybrid machine can go from tablet to laptop or back. Stylus, Play Store Con. Software is still in beta. Ho-hum speakers. 151 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ku3Ss0 NEVER MISS OUT Tech Be the earliest adopter.

Anybody who clicked on it was whisked to a Windows support scam, according to ZDNet. ZDNet’s Zack Whittaker reports that this bogus ad – perched at the top of search results, labelled sponsored ad served by Google – didn’t infect visitors with malware. That’s a thin silver lining, but it doesn’t mean that the scammers didn’t try to swindle visitors. ZDNet used a tracer tool to examine the fake ad, which was served up through Google’s own ad network. It apparently resolved fully to Amazon.com – probably as a way to trick Google’s systems into accepting it. Once visitors clicked on the “Amazon” ad, though, they were hijacked, sent to a page that detected what platform their systems were running on. If the page detected a visitor using Windows, it would present a Microsoft-branded blue screen of death. Mac users were told that their systems had been seized by crypto-ransomware. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Visitors who tried to get the heck out of there by exiting the page would get a popup with a script that added random characters to the web address. In some cases, it was freezing both the browser and the computer. As of Thursday morning, the fake Amazon ad was no longer appearing, but the website hosting the scam was still active. ZDNet chose not to link to that site. Google declined to comment, while Amazon hadn’t responded to ZDNet’s inquiry by the time the story posted on Thursday. Would this have happened if that spoofed Amazon ad had appeared on the Bing search engine, given that Bing imposed a blanket ban on online tech support ads in May 2016? The search engine changed its advertising policy to block all online tech support ads, including both the legitimate tech support companies and all the swindlers. Bing did so because the sheer volume and audacity of the crooks had spoiled it for everyone. Bing’s blanket ban might not have picked up on the bogus Amazon ad, though. After all, these wolves apparently pulled on a pretty convincing sheepskin, managing to let them slip through Google’s safeguards. We’ve written quite a bit about support scams. It used to be that these fake tech support scammers would call us, but nowadays, as more and more people refuse to take calls from unknown numbers, the crooks have been adapting. Instead of them calling you, it’s increasingly common that they’ll use a web ad or popup that simply runs the scam in reverse: the crook will display a warning and advise you to call them, typically on a toll-free number. What to do? If you receive a cold call about accepting support, just hang up. If you receive a web popup or ad urging you to call for support, ignore it. If you need help with your computer, ask someone whom you know, and like, and trust. When searching for Amazon, remember that you don’t need to use Google. Simply go straight to Amazon.com.   DEALING WITH FAKE SUPPORT CALLS Here’s a short podcast you can recommend to friends and family. We make it clear it clear that these guys are scammers (and why), and offer some practical advice on how to deal with them.

They borrow many features from Samsung's tablets, including a touch screen, a stylus and an Android app store to extend the app offerings. The hope is that the new versions will attract a broader range of consumers than the K-12 students who mostly use Chromebooks now. Currently, Chromebooks are stripped-down laptops that don't function well in the absence of a Wi-Fi connection. Here are some details on the new laptops: In this Feb. 8, 2017, photo, a Google Chromebook displays Netflix in New York. Google Chromebook laptops are impractical for many people because they¿re little more than expensive paperweights when they¿re out of range of an internet connection. Yet they¿ve defied expectations and made tremendous inroads in one of the least likely places: U.S. schools. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) — PRICING: Samsung's Chromebook Plus starts selling Sunday for $449. The Chromebook Pro, with a faster processor, will come out in late April for $549. That's cheaper than MacBooks and many Windows laptops, but still high for Chromebooks. Budget models sell for less than $200. — BECOMING A TABLET: Both new Chromebooks have 360-degree hinges so that the screens can flip over into a tablet mode. This makes them similar to "2 in 1" Windows offerings, which use hinges or have detachable keyboards to turn laptops into tablets. One oddity: With the screen faceup, the keyboard is on the back. Though typing is disabled in that mode, it feels odd in your hands. — A WRITING INSTRUMENT: The Chromebooks borrow a design element from Samsung's Note phones. Fortunately, it's not the battery found in the fire-prone Note 7 phone, but a stylus that fits into a spring-loaded slot on the side when not in use. Apple's iPad Pro and Microsoft Surface tablets don't have any slot, making it easy to misplace the stylus. — ANDROID'S ARRIVAL: Google is bringing Android apps to Chromebooks, broadening their possible uses and allowing people to use the devices even when an internet connection isn't available. Many Android apps are already designed to work with phones and tablets, even when offline. The Netflix Android app, for instance, supports downloads for offline viewing; Netflix on the browser requires a live internet connection. Android on Chromebooks is still in a "beta" test mode and is available only on a handful of devices. The two new Samsung models will be among them. More Chromebooks will get Android when the Pro comes out in April. In this Feb. 8, 2017, photo, a Google Chromebook displays Adobe Lightroom in New York.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Samsung Chromebook Pro Review By Hubert Nguyen on 02/10/2017 06:00 PST Launched at CES 2017 during the Samsung press conference, the Samsung Chromebook Pro is a 12.3” thin & light laptop that introduces two “firsts” to the Chrome OS world: the ability to run Android Apps acquired via the Google Play store, and handwriting support with a digitizer. These features are powered by an Intel processor and packed into an all-metal chassis. The Samsung Chromebook Pro is the first of a new class of Chrome OS laptops. Let’s see what it can do. Industrial design (very good) The Samsung Chromebook Pro is a clamshell Chrome OS laptop, but you would immediately notice that it has many design elements coming from Samsung’s tablet line of products (itself inspired by phones), including the Galaxy TabPro S, which is a Windows 10 tablet. The round edges and general thinness (display and main body) are very distinctive of the mobile heritage that Samsung likes to bring into the world of PCs. The Chromebook Pro is very agreeable to hold, as there is not a single sharp edge on the device. At 2.38Lbs (1.08 Kg), this is a very light computer that you can carry around with ease and comfort. You back and shoulders will thank you! Multimode Laptop Because it swivels at a complete 360-degree, the Samsung Chromebook Pro can turn into a very nice Chrome OS tablet. The way it is designed makes it feel very natural to hold when in tablet mode. Of course, it is relatively thick when compared to native tablets, but it is thin enough not to feel a bit odd like some laptops do in that mode. As a true Multi-Mode portable, it can also be used in Stand, Tent, Tablet and Laptop modes. In stand mode, the keyboard should be disabled to avoid accidental key-presses. Keyboard and trackpad There are three things that are the foundation to any PC experience: Display, Keyboard, Trackpad. These are the “do not fail” pillars.  The Chromebook Pro keyboard is a full-size one, and has the same layout as defined by Google (no CAPS key, etc…). The travel key is more than 1mm, and it feels very standard. The keys are mostly flat, but comfortable to type on and offer a good grip. The trackpad is about 100x55mm and is comfortable even if we’ve seen larger ones in the industry. Since Chrome OS doesn’t heavily rely on gestures, it’s not a problem at all. The trackpad seems to have a glass surface and is very nice to use. It is also very responsive. Ports The thing with ultra-thin design is that you need to make choices about which ports to embed. There is simply not enough height for a standard USB Type A connector. Instead, there are two USB C connectors (5 Gbps speed), one on either side. Of course, there’s a 3.5mm connector as well, along with a Volume rocker, the Power control, and the integrated stylus. The lack of USB Type A (Standard) can be an issue if you forget your adapter and need to use a USB key, or connect to a printer for some reason. However, finding a cable is not difficult, and if you bump into this problem, it is probably worth getting a handful of cables or adapters to disseminate in your frequent locations and bags. You can get USB-C to USB-A (female) adapter from Aukey for ~$5 a piece Invisible from the outside, this laptop has a TPM module for security, and an accelerometer + gyroscope sensor. Stylus: a first for Chrome OS Yes, you read that right: the Samsung Chromebook Pro has a stylus that fits into the right side of the chassis. it is well-designed and has a “clicky” back which has no real purpose, except to tell you that you have pressed it hard enough to insert/remove it, and it is also fun for those who like to click it with the thumb. The pen’s tip has also been optimized for having a good feel. I do not use the word “natural” because it never feels like a real pen. However, it is not slippery and doesn’t feel weird. It is good enough that you will not think about how the pen feels on the surface. The stylus is large/wide enough to write with reasonable comfort, thanks to the flat design that makes it feel as if it was a (round) pen with a large radius. I do not have any issues with taking notes or drawing schematics over multiple briefings or meetings. Speakers (mild power) Two speakers are located on the bottom side of the laptop. They are decent, but not all that powerful. If you watch movies in a quiet environment (home, closed office), it is perfectly fine, but at my (quiet) desk, I already have the volume set to “maximum” (it was at a maximum on Netflix too). The speaker is ~20 inches from my ears. Display (excellent) Samsung is often synonymous with “excellent displays”, and this time again doesn’t disappoint. The company is offering a high-quality 12.3” high PPI display (2400×1600) that uses what looks like an IPS LCD technology (good colors, wide view angle). Learn more: What is PPI? This screen has a 3:2-inch ratio which is more commonly known in the context of 35mm photos. In any case, the display is more “square” than 16:9 displays which are elongated to match movies. 3:2 has the advantage of being better for anything that uses vertical space, like web pages, email clients, books… most reading-based activities will benefit from a 3:2 ratio. "EXCELLENT"The display delivers rich colors, especially in moderate ambient lighting. The maximum brightness that we measured is 533 NITs, which is excellent and means that you can easily work in a bright environment (outdoors) and scene with high brightness can be reproduced vividly. In a dark room, the black levels (how deep blacks are) could be better – especially against the OLED display of the Galaxy TabPro S, but LCD technology can only go so far on that front. Nevertheless, it is very agreeable to use this Chromebook for video streaming in bed. Learn more: LCD vs. OLED. Which is Best And Why? Different applications will react differently to the 3:2 ratio. Netflix simply adds black border at the top and bottom for wider content (no cropping). YouTube does the same. Nothing unexpected here, but some video apps can decide to crop to 4:3 ratio, which is closer to 3:2. In both cases, I recommend using web experience, instead of the Android app. The web version is better and smoother. Since the display has a higher resolution than 1080p (1920×1080), you can use 1440p or even 4K video streaming on Youtube. Both are absolutely beautiful. 1440p at 30FPS is completely fluid/smooth. 4K mostly works, but you can expect some hiccups here and here (I do not think it is my WIFI or Internet since 4K works fine on all other systems). Software: run Android apps! What Chrome OS is and how beneficial it is has been well documented. This Chromebook has every benefit regarding cloud-connectivity, ease of use and security as previous models. However, it is the first commercial product to run Android Apps out of the box, and this is a huge deal. Google started testing its Android container for Chromebooks around the last quarter of 2016. "ALLOWING CHROMEBOOKS TO RUN ANDROID APPS IS AWESOME"Chromebooks have always been extremely simple and secure. However, that security existed because it was not possible to install apps, and offline capabilities were limited. In short, it had great pro and cons. In the past, some tasks that do not have good web implementations were off limit for Chromebooks users. Google worked very hard to remove the friction, and allowing Chromebooks to run Android apps is awesome. This will close the gap between regular PCs and Chromebooks for many applications. Skype, (simple) Video editing… there are a ton of tasks that you would prefer doing with an app. Now, you can. Android apps already run in a container, so they are quite secure. There is also a permission checker that will ask the user for access to resources when needed. While you cannot reproduce everything your Windows/Mac laptop can, Chrome OS has muscled up big time when it comes to app availability. Stylus user experience (good) Out of the box, you can take written notes using Google Keep. This works very well, and the ink speed and responsive is very decent. You can write, and draw. It is even possible to run a character recognition algorithm to extract text (and make search easier) if you want to. Keep in mind that this is running on a low-power CPU. The second option I used is Microsoft’s OneNote, which is very popular as well. In OneNote, the ink is not as fast, but it is still very usable for schematics. Because the ink is slower, writing in rapidly using small characters is not ideal, and you must slow down your note taking. With Google Keep, the ink is fast enough to make small notes writing “OK” – although it could be better. Obviously, a faster computer would have less ink lag, but you would also enter a different category of computers that cost much more. Performance for the price: very good. Let’s be clear, Chromebooks are not about “absolute performance” and winning benchmarks. I will go over the system performance just to give you an idea of what you are dealing with. Opinion: Are benchmarks important? What do they mean? The Samsung Chromebook Pro is powered by an Intel Core m3-6Y30 processor (the same used in the Galaxy TabPro S), so it is optimized for low-power rather than peak performance. There’s 4GB of RAM (LPDDR3), which is more than enough for Chrome OS since it is pretty light (unless you open dozens of web Tabs…). This processor can run Windows 10 decently. There are 32GB of internal storage, and you can add more thanks to a micro SD. Sandisk has a 200GB micro SD for around $70, while Samsung has a 128GB micro SD for ~$45. Chromebooks can be built with many types of processors, but a lot of them come with the same Intel Core m3-6Y30 as this computer. I have seen some that use a Core i3-5005U, which is a little slower. More powerful alternatives can be found with the Core m5-6Y57 and Core m7-6Y75. The m7 is significantly faster (~20-25%) and HP is one of the major OEMs to use it. However, configurations with this CPU cost $800+ more than their m3-6Y30 versions (usually there is 8GB of RAM too). This is a very steep price for this kind of performance jump. At the end of the day, this computer offers very good performance for the price, and that is probably what most people search when they look at it. Battery Life With a battery capacity of 39 Wh, the Samsung Chromebook Pro ($549, 2.38 lbs) is close of the 45Wh of the HP Chromebook 13 ($599+, 2.86 lbs) but the heavier Dell Chromebook 13 (~$640, 3.23 lbs) features a 67 Wh battery. If you compare between those three, Dell sacrifices some portability for a better Wh/Lbs and better Wh/Price. If you have more extreme battery needs, this may be a good option to look at, if you don’t mind the extra weight. As it stands, I found the battery life of this computer to be very good. It can be left for nearly a week without charging. Using it, the battery didn’t plunge, and with my particular usage maybe I would get 6 hours of continuous use which I consider to be very good. Keep in mind that OEMS have battery benchmarks that are often not realistic. Since Chromebooks are heavily reliant on wireless Internet, your battery life would be affected by your network and display brightness conditions. For comparable performance, the battery capacity remains the most potent of all battery indicators. Conclusion: 9/10 At $549, the Samsung Chromebook Pro provides an excellent Chromebook user experience, a terrific design, and a very nice user experience. The ability to run Android apps should extend the reach of Chrome OS to a new group of users who could not do everything they wanted online. Google nailed it with this feature, and we expect it to get even better in the future. Add the sigital stylus to the mix and the Samsung Chromebook Pro makes Chromebook history. "THE SAMSUNG CHROMEBOOK PRO MAKES CHROMEBOOK HISTORY"Price aside, this computer gives very good absolute web performance. Browsing it with feels fast and smooth. Sometimes more so than on a more powerful laptop. Keep in mind that as you open more browser tabs, hardware resources will eventually be scarce. In any case, it is fair to say that it performs better (for web browsing) than a Windows laptop of the same price. It is always important to evaluate if a mix of online and Android apps can get the job done for your specific use case, but if that is the case, you should consider the Samsung Chromebook Pro.

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker Samsung Chromebook Plus review: future imperfect The best Chrome OS laptop, for now by Dieter Bohn@backlon Feb 10, 2017, 9:00am EST share tweet Linkedin I know the exact moment I fell in love with the Chromebook Plus. I was reading a Kindle book and found a passage I wanted to save. I pulled out the stylus and tapped the "Capture Screen" button on the menu that automatically popped up. Then I tapped "Annotate in Google Keep" and jotted a few notes right on the page, just like I used to do with real books. Then I went back to reading. Later, I wanted to cite that quote but couldn’t remember it exactly. So I opened up Google Keep and did a simple search, which brought up my note (Google had read and indexed it in the cloud). I saw my note and saw the passage circled right there. I just had to tap "Grab Image Text" in Keep and the quote I wanted was immediately right there in the note, ready for me to copy and paste into my Google document. There aren’t a lot of "That’s actually magical" experiences for me in tech anymore, but that was one. And what made it possible was the combination of a Chromebook that could be used as a tablet, a stylus to take notes, Android apps, and a proper desktop browser and keyboard. The rest of my experience using the Chromebook Plus wasn't quite so magical, but it still had its moments. Samsung’s Chromebook Plus is the first of a new generation of Chromebooks running Chrome OS, and it's shipping next week for $449. It’s one of a pair of Chromebooks that Samsung is releasing in the first half of the year. The other is the Chromebook Pro, coming in April and costs $100 more thanks to a more powerful Intel processor. These Chromebooks (and others sure to follow soon) are a big deal because they are in the vanguard of the next phase of Chrome OS, one where it supports Android apps, works better on tablets, and accepts stylus input — all while having a full, desktop-class web browser and web apps. Done well, the combination of those things could take it out of the "couch computer" and education niches the OS currently occupies and make it a more viable competitor to low-end Windows computers. It could maybe even convince some iPad and Mac users to switch. The key phrase in that narrative, of course, is "done well." Conceptually, it all makes sense. In terms of actual execution, Chrome OS has a long way to go down a twisty and treacherous road before it can get to where it wants to be. And when it comes to Android apps, it also seems to have sprained its ankle at the start of the journey. Chromebook Plus & Pro Specs 12.3-inch 2400x1600, 3:2 aspect ratio touchscreen 4GB RAM 32GB Storage, microSD expandable Dual-array mic 720p webcam 802.11 Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 2 USB Type-C ports Stylus "Island Type" keyboard, no backlight Accelerometer and Gyroscope 11" x 8.7" x .55" 2.4 pounds 39Wh battery, battery life around 8 hours Processors: Plus: OP1 ARM / Pro: Intel Core m3-6y30 Price: Plus $449 / Pro: $549 Taken strictly as a Chromebook, the Plus is relatively expensive, but it justifies almost all of its asking price. The metal body is sturdy, yet light, with a beautiful, high-resolution screen that's capable of getting almost painfully bright. That screen rotates all the way around the back on a couple of reliably firm hinges, so you can set the screen at any angle or turn it around for a tablet mode. It's not an especially beautiful device; it's a little ordinary, in fact. The edges of the keyboard deck and screen are rounded in such a way that when it's closed, it looks like a thin little sandwich. It won't win any design awards, but at least it's simple and predictable. This is a Chromebook, it does not aspire to impress you with its looks. It simply is good at what it is intended to be: a thin, well-built machine for showing you Chrome browser tabs. My biggest complaint is that the keyboard, which is decent enough for typing, isn't backlit. Everything else about the Chromebook Plus (including the price, relative to other Chromebooks) communicates premium aspirations, so the lack of what should be a standard feature grates. The touchpad is also a bit smaller than it ought to be, but it's responsive and accurate. Really, the only other bit of hardware to note is perhaps the most important part: the stylus. It's almost identical to what you'll find on a Galaxy Note, except that this one doesn't have a button on it (and no, you can't put it back in the silo backwards). Google says that the stylus tech in the Chromebook is not exclusive to Samsung, so there's every reason to expect we'll see stylus-equipped Chromebooks (and tablets) from other manufacturers this year. Sticking to the "just use it as a traditional Chromebook" theme, the Chromebook Plus seriously outperformed my expectations. It has an ARM processor in it, which usually bodes ill for a device's ability to handle more than a half-dozen tabs or so. But right now I have nine of them open — some of which are pretty heavy web apps — and I'm not detecting any appreciable slowdown. Performance on ARM Counting maximum tabs before things get hairy is an unofficial way of checking a Chrome OS device's performance, and I'd say the number for the Plus is around 12 or 15. That's a completely respectable number for an ARM device. The processor, if you're wondering, is called the OP1, and though it appears to be made by Rockchip, that branding isn't anywhere near this Chromebook. Apparently it was optimized from the jump for Chrome OS, and it shows. After a fresh boot, I got an Octane 2.0 benchmark score of 9400, which puts the Chromebook Plus ahead of the majority of Chromebooks sold right now. In fact, every Chromebook listed at Chromebook Chart that performs better than this score has a more powerful Intel processor instead of ARM. The other thing to consider is that this ARM processor may do a better job of running most Android apps than the Intel processor on the Chromebook Pro. Those apps need to be translated from ARM code to x86 to run on Intel machines. However, the Android beta on the Chromebook Pro is in such a sorry state that I can't really judge. Google promises that it'll all be fixed by April, when the Pro launches. Right now, the Plus handles Android apps much better than the Pro. Until I tried the Chromebook Plus, I would have told you that it isn't a good idea to spend this much money on an ARM-based Chromebook — and if I'm totally honest I might still have a hangup about doing so now. If you're interested in this device, the biggest question is whether it's worth spending the extra $100 for the Intel processor. Unfortunately, I'm not in a great position to answer that question. Strictly running Chrome, the Pro version is faster and can handle more tabs, but this Plus version performs so much better than I expected that it's not an easy choice. I think for many people, the cheaper Plus will do just fine. I'm pleased with battery life as well. On our looping webpage rundown test, it lasted eight and a half hours. In my real-world use, which involves having a bunch of pretty heavy web apps open at all times and constant browsing, I didn't quite get to eight hours, but I got close (interestingly, the Pro version of this laptop manages to last just a little bit longer). This isn't a battery champion, but it is better for me than, say, recent Mac laptops. There are two USB Type-C ports — you can charge on either side — and you'll need adapters (which don't come in the box) for using external monitors or more traditional USB devices. There's also a microSD card slot for expanded storage if the onboard 32GB isn't enough for you (and it might not be if you download a bunch of Netflix shows). So that's everything that's impressive about the Chromebook Plus. We know what Chromebooks are now, and so it shouldn't be a surprise that a concerted effort from both Samsung and Google created a very good one. But this isn't supposed to just be a "Good Chromebook," it's supposed to be a new generation that's something more than what we've seen before. And unfortunately, those larger ambitions are precisely where Google has run into trouble. The trouble starts with the tablet mode. Google either isn't finished with it yet or just doesn't know what people want to do with tablets yet (I suspect it's both). When you flip the screen around, everything goes full screen, with no option to split windows into sidebars. Want to leave it in tablet mode and put it to sleep? Sorry, Charlie — hitting the power button simply takes you to the lock screen, where you'll have to sit and watch it for 40 seconds before it finally powers down. Given that Google is pushing out Chrome OS updates on a regular and reliable schedule, I expect those smaller issues will get fixed at some point. What I'm less sure about is the consistency and utility of Android apps on Chrome OS. Take the stylus, which is a great idea, but badly implemented right now. Google does a smart thing by having it pop open a menu when you pull it out of its silo, but that's where the current intelligence mostly ends. It's useful for tapping tiny icons when in tablet mode, but there aren't many web apps that work well with it. Instead, most of the apps that the stylus is meant to go with are the Android apps, like Google Keep. In the future, Google Keep will use fancy machine learning to reduce the lag. In the present, trying to take even a basic note is like writing with invisible ink: a letter sometimes doesn't even appear until you're onto the next one. And the root of the problem is that Android apps on Chrome OS are still in beta — a very much unfinished experience. Here's the basics of the situation: in this beta, the Android component is running on the previous version, Marshmallow, instead of the latest version, Nougat. The practical effect of that issue is that you have only a handful of window size choices for Android apps: tablet layout, phone layout, and full screen. None are really what you want — what you want is to just resize them. You won’t be able to until Android apps on Chrome OS exit beta and graduate to Nougat. Living with a bad beta The companion device to the Chromebook Plus is the Chromebook Pro. But it's not coming out until April. We tested it this week to see what the state of Android apps on Chrome OS is really like. The answer: it's not good. At all. Read the full story There are other issues with Android apps. There aren't enough of them that look good or work well on large screens, because the vast majority of them are designed for phones, not tablet or laptops. Google says it's working with developers to fix that, but it's been saying that for five years. Maybe Chrome OS will finally be the spark it needs. But how do they perform? Well, again the story is mixed. On the Chromebook Plus, I found that most apps felt slightly slower than they do on my Google Pixel XL phone. It's certainly passable, but it feels janky when compared to my two-year-old iPad Air 2. I have also had too many Android apps crash or glitch out, and by too many I mean it happens about once a day. It's forgivable in a beta, but still aggravating. The situation on the Plus is miles better than the situation on the Intel-based Chromebook Pro right now, which is so riddled with bugs and issues that I declined reviewing it in favor of this Plus. I describe in more detail the situation in another article, here. All of which is a shame, because there are those "aha" moments of greatness like switching from the Kindle Android app to the Google Keep Android app to a real desktop-class browser all on the same device. Or downloading Netflix shows in the Android app on the same device I use to get Real Work done. Or just simply playing rymdkapsel on a big screen. So how do you judge the Chromebook Plus? Weighed against the standards of Chromebooks like the Acer Chromebook R11 or Dell Chromebook 13, it's a standout device. It's my pick as the best Chromebook you can buy today, so long as you're willing to spend the extra money to get this beautiful screen and quality hardware. It outdoes cheaper devices and will be easier to use and maintain than a comparably priced Windows machine. When you see (and argue) about the score below, that's what I'm looking at. This is simply a great Chromebook when measured against those standards. Weighed against the ambitions of what it aspires to be? The Chromebook Plus clearly comes up short. The software for good Android apps and great stylus support just isn't ready yet. I want an inexpensive, tablet-style device that combines the best of mobile apps with a desktop-class browser. Windows isn't really there, the iPad isn't really there, and the Mac will apparently never be there. But with some fixes to Android and some developer help, this device could be exactly what I want. Google is chasing after exactly the right thing with Chrome OS right now. It just has a lot more running to do.

The company’s Android platform is still in its infancy in the grand scheme of things, and yet smart thinking on Google’s part caused adoption to skyrocket in no time at all. By making Android open source and offering it to hardware vendors for free (with important strings attached), Google made the decision all too easy for companies like Samsung, HTC and Motorola, which all needed a fresh new platform to enter the smartphone market. After all, it was becoming increasingly obvious that industry leaders like Nokia and BlackBerry were doomed. And why build your own platform when you can use Android for free? The goal for Google, of course, is to put its various products and services in front of as many eyeballs as possible, and to make it as easy as possible to access and use them. The more often people use Google services, the more data Google can collect and the more ads Google can display. The company is doing great things, of that there is no question, but Google is a business and selling ads is how it stays in business. With the smartphone market covered, Google has expanded its presence in other key markets. Android TV, Android Wear, and Google’s work with IoT devices are all examples of the company’s efforts to widen its reach. And then there’s Chrome, which continues to be dismissed by some industry watchers despite having made tremendous gains in recent years; despite the overall decline in the PC market last year, Chromebook shipments climbed 20%. The majority of Chromebook gains have come in the education and low-end consumer markets, where cost among the biggest factors that contribute to purchase decisions. But Google and its partners will have to address other markets as well if Chrome is to become a major player in the market. Don't Miss: Is this the perfect Android phone? It’s easy to dismiss Chrome OS. Windows is massive! Windows is too big to fail! Windows will be the world’s go-to desktop computing for decades to come! Of course, those of us who have been covering consumer tech for as long as I have can remember when the exact same things were said about Symbian, Windows Mobile and BlackBerry OS. In fact, Nokia executives used to laugh at me in 2007 and 2008 when I asked them how they planned to adapt to the shifting smartphone market. I don’t imagine any of those executives are laughing anymore. Now, this isn’t to say that Windows is a doomed platform — at least, not anytime soon. But to state things mildly, the future does not look terribly bright for Windows at the moment. Market research firm IDC estimates that 428.5 million smartphones shipped in the fourth quarter alone last year, with the overwhelming majority of those phones having been powered by Android. Meanwhile, IDC says that a total of 260.2 million PCs shipped in all of 2016. Even though Microsoft currently owns more than 90% of the PC market according to Net Applications, Android user numbers have continued to grow while PC shipments decline. So, what happens years from now when all these Android users have the option to buy a new Windows PC, or a new Chrome OS computer that gives them tighter integration with their phones and access to all the same apps and services they enjoy on other devices, in addition to desktop-grade apps? Of course, Android apps themselves will likely be “desktop-grade” by then, but the point is Microsoft’s advantages with Windows have been dwindling slowly over the past decade, and it looks like the pace may soon accelerate. Especially when you add Chrome devices like the new Samsung Chromebook Pro into the mix. 01_chromebook_hero_shot_front_forward_facing_screen_aMore Read More First, a few thoughts on Chrome OS, which shares a name with Google’s wildly popular cross-platform web browser. This is apropos, as anyone who has used a Chrome computer will tell you, because the operating system itself looks and feels very similar to Chrome for Windows or Mac, and the Chrome browser is the focal point of Chrome OS. The best way to describe Chrome OS may be to call it something of a hybrid between the Chrome desktop browser and the Android platform. The user interface will feel quite familiar to anyone with an Android smartphone, because it utilizes the same Material Design elements as Android. Out of the box, however, most functions happen in the browser (even in offline mode). Upon powering up a Chrome device for the first time, users will be greeted with a familiar desktop view similar to what you might find on a Windows or Mac PC. A “Launcher” button in the bottom-left corner replaces the Start button you’d find on a Windows machine, and a series of app icons are found in the menu bar beside it. Clicking those app icons doesn’t open individual apps, however. Instead, they open associated web pages. So, for example, clicking the Gmail icon will take you to gmail.com, and clicking the Docs icon will open the Google Docs website. You can still save files and work on them offline, and you can also download new “apps” from Google’s Chrome Web Store. Those apps all live within the Chrome browser, however — on a Chrome OS device, the browser is a portal into nearly every function. At least, it used to be. 03_chromebook_hero_shot_stand_mode_front_facing_right_screen_aMore On newer Chromebooks like Samsung’s Chromebook Pro, users also have access to the Google Play store along with all the Android apps within. While some apps work better than others on Chrome OS, new users will be surprised at how well Android apps function on their Chrome devices. As just one example, Newton — my go-to email app on iOS and macOS devices — is far faster on the Chromebook Pro than on my MacBook Air. In fact, the Android version is better designed as well, and is ironically better suited to a desktop environment than the macOS version. In fact, it feels like everything is faster on the Chromebook Pro than it is on a conventional computer. Samsung’s Chromebook Pro is powered by a 2.2GHz Intel Core m3 processor along with Intel HD graphics and 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM. Those specs would seem underpowered on a Windows or Mac machine, but Chrome OS strips out the complexities that most consumers likely don’t need anyway. It feels like a mobile OS, and it flies like a mobile OS. Websites load just as fast as they would on any Windows or Apple PC, and apps open even faster since they’re so much more streamlined. Samsung’s less expensive Chromebook Plus is powered by a 2GHz hexa-core OP1 ARM chipset, which offers a bit less power and lesser graphics performance while shaving $100 from the device’s price tag. The two models are otherwise nearly identical. In its current state, the Chrome OS platform is more than capable enough to handle both work and play for the vast majority of users. Chrome is not yet ready for people who need to use custom enterprise software or complex software like professional video editing apps. But for everyone else, it’s a serious contender. 02_chromebook_hero_shot_front_facing_left_screen_aMore As you might expect on a Samsung device, the 12.3-inch LED display on the Chromebook Pro is stunning. It features 2400×1600 Quad HD resolution and brightness is rated at 400nit. Streaming videos look fantastic on the bright screen, and the 3:2 aspect ratio offers plenty of room to position multiple apps around the screen and multitask. The Chromebook Pro also ships with a stylus that can be popped out from an edge just like a Note-series smartphone or tablet. It’s not quite as feature rich as the S Pen and it’s certainly not integrated as deeply into the operating system, but it’s great for taking notes. For drawing or painting, Samsung’s new notebook will ship with an app called Art Canvas, though it wasn’t available in the pre-release software running on my test unit. The stylus can also be used to capture portions of the screen, or as a virtual magnifying glass to help users read small print. Samsung put a great deal of effort into the writing experience on the Chromebook Pro, and it shows. The feel is fantastic — as close to “pen on paper” as Samsung’s Note smartphones — and a special algorithm developed by Google helps lower latency by predicting where each stroke will go as you write. There is still noticeable latency on the device when you write quickly, but I don’t find it to be bothersome at all. Also of note, the screen on the Chromebook Pro can fold all the way open so the device can be used comfortably in tablet mode. I only wish as much attention had been paid to the keyboard, which is one of my least favorite things about this laptop. The plastic keys on the device feel cheap and they require too much pressure to depress. I also wish the keyboard had wider delete and tab keys, though I do like the dedicated Search button in place of the Caps Lock. This key opens the Launcher window, which is a home base of sorts in Chrome OS, giving users access to a search bar and to apps. 05_chromebook_hero_shot_tablet_mode_front_facing_top_screen_aMore The trackpad is nice and big on the Chromebook Pro, and it’s also quite responsive. The device includes two USB Type-C ports, either of which can be used to charge the notebook, as well as a 3.5mm audio jack and a microSD card slot. The Chromebook Pro ships with just 32GB of onboard storage since Chrome OS is a cloud-first platform, but microSDXC support adds an inexpensive and easy option for expansion. The device itself weighs just 2.38 pounds and measures 11.04 x 8.72 x 0.55 inches. That makes it thinner and lighter than Apple’s new 13-inch MacBook Pro, which measures 0.59 inches thick and weighs a hair over 3 pounds. The light weight can be attributed in part to the plastic housing, but the Chromebook Pro also only has a 39-watt-hour battery compared to up to 54.5-watt-hours in the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The Chromebook still manages to offer an estimated 8-10 hours of battery life per charge though, thanks largely to its efficient Core m3 chipset and the lightweight Chrome OS. In the end, the Chromebook Pro is a device that redefines the Chromebook category. It’s the first Chromebook to include an integrated stylus and pen support, but the laptop’s power plays a bigger role in this area. Samsung’s Chromebook Pro and devices like it offer performance that hasn’t been seen before on a Chrome OS device, extending the addressable market to include power users who otherwise wouldn’t look twice at a Chromebook. As for pricing and availability, the Samsung Chromebook Pro will be released sometime in late April for $549. Of note, the Google Play store for Chrome will exit beta around the same time. Samsung’s more affordable ARM-powered Chromebook Plus can be preordered right now for $449 on Amazon or on Samsung’s website, and it will start shipping this Sunday, February 12th.

'Wow' Sammy attempts to take Chrome OS high end. Key word, attempts 10 Feb 2017 at 14:01, Iain Thomson Hands-on It's been nearly six years since Google announced the launch of its own operating system, Chrome OS, and the CR‑48 Chromebook running it. Since then, Chromebooks have carved out a solid chunk of market share for the operating system. Around 50 per cent of US schoolchildren use Chromebooks in the classroom and Chrome OS is now the second most popular operating system in the country. Typically a Chromebook will sell for under $200, and that's a major selling point for such systems. The vast majority of time spent on a laptop is either watching the internet or videos, emailing, and writing, and the Chromebook can handle all of that easily, and if little Timmy breaks his, it's cheap to replace and easy to reinstall lost applications. But there's precious little profit in computers that cheap, so computer manufacturers have been trying out more expensive models. Google kicked this off in 2013 with the Pixel, a $1,449 machine aimed at wooing over Apple users. It's a good machine (our review unit still works fine four years later) but at that price, it didn't find many takers. Now Samsung is taking a go at selling to more cash-rich buyers with its Chromebook Pro, a $549 laptop that it's hoping will find favor in the workplace. It goes on sale in April. Convertible to cash in? The first impression of the Pro was pretty good – it's a small, light unit with a very impressive 12.3-inch screen. The machine has a stylus built into the casing and is light enough at 2.38lb to make lugging it around easy. The 281 x 222 x 14mm magnesium casing feels fairly sturdy and has proved scratch resistant in the week or so we've had it. The only jarring note was the protruding volume rocker and power buttons, which stick out a millimetre or so and occasionally catch on something when retrieving the Pro from a tight rucksack. The 2,400 by 1,600 pixel touchscreen is a lovely bit of kit, clear and bright and with a 3:2 aspect ratio that makes it very handy for documents and web pages. While the forums show that there are plenty of skeptics out there on the merits of a touchscreen, this responsive system shows the best points of the technology and you get accustomed to using it for scrolling over a button or mouse. Getting the screen right is important, because the Pro is also a convertible. The screen is held on 360-degree hinges and it folds over to make a useable, if somewhat bulky, tablet. There's also a 720p camera for videoconferencing at the top of the screen. The Pro's convertible hinge is a nice touch, but a detachable keyboard would be nicer The 113mm rectangular stylus, housed in the top right of the unit, is certainly handy, and having a dedicated slot for it is a definite advantage that you don't get with fancier systems like Microsoft's Surface. There's not much latency in on-screen writing with the stylus (Wacom supplied the technology) and it's useful enough – but only if you have a need for such a widget. Popping out the stylus brings up a menu option for its common uses Under the hood there's a moderately powerful 2.2GHz Intel Core M3‑6Y30 processor and HD Graphics 515 chipset, a somewhat measly 4GB of LPDDR3 memory, and 32GB of internal storage – good enough but just barely. However, in the latter case there's also a slot to allow microSD storage cards to augment the internal capacity – a very welcome feature that The Reg wishes more phone and laptop manufacturers would use. For connectivity, there's twin-antenna 802.11ac Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth version 4. The Pro also comes with two USB-C ports (for pity's sake, Apple – learn from this) and a Type C to Type A converter plug ships with the system. The Pro comes with a 39Wh battery that gives a solid nine hours of performance. In our tests we ran about an hour of video, another hour of gaming, and then a full work day before reaching for the charger. We could have gone more than nine hours if we'd lowered the screen brightness or cut down on music videos. So far it all looks fairly good, however, the Pro's outer shell does come with faults. The keyboard is the Pro's worst feature, with OKish key travel but some dumb design decisions. The often-used backspace button has been chopped down, making it easy to mishit. As an added bonus, the lockscreen button is directly above the backspace key, giving added possibilities for mishit keys. After typing for a week, the best you can say about the keyboard is that you get used to it; it lacks the smooth feel of an older ThinkPad or Pixel system. The only other hardware letdown was the overall feel of the device. It has little of the reassuring solidity of a Macbook Air or Pixel Chromebook, and instead feels somewhat flimsy and the shell can be flexed with the hands. Android and Chrome, sittin' in a tree The Pro will be one of the first Chromebooks to ship with enables support for running Android apps. Right now, that support is in beta and unfinished. Pretty much ever since Chrome OS emerged, people have been asking when Android phone and tablet applications will come to Google's laptop operation system. At last year's I/O developer conference, Google committed to the marriage of its two platforms. To pull this off, Android isn't opened in an emulator, but in a separate container that's sandboxed from the main laptop operating system. In tests, this worked fairly well, and I suspect it's going to be a real selling point once Google finishes the software and Android developers catch on. Theoretically, this fusion opens up a vast new range of applications that can run on Chrome OS. One of the weaknesses of Chrome was that developers didn't write enough good apps for it, so the combo system fills that gap. Up to a point, that is. While the Pro attempts to run 'droid apps, and allows them to use the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope for control and share the cut'n'paste clipboard with Chrome OS, some applications won't run, or run as you would like them. The secure messaging app Signal won't work on the Pro, and my most commonly played game, Age of Civilisations, won't run in full-screen mode. You have to brace yourself for disappointment. Android apps show up on-screen in either phone or tablet mode, or full screen, for instance. This is supposed to be fixed when Android Nougat is brought to Chrome OS and applications are updated – right now, the Chrome OS on the Pro we reviewed is running Marshmallow. Developers will need to do some work to accommodate the fusion with Chrome OS Developers are going to need to do some reworking of their apps so their software performs reliably on x86-based laptops rather than an ARM-powered phones. But they almost certainly will, eventually, since this marriage of Android and Chrome will open up new markets and revenue streams when done properly. Security is another big advantage of the Chrome OS. The built-in Trusted Platform Module makes the Chrome OS very difficult to get malware onto and Google is offering six-figure bounties for people who can show them how to do it – with no takers so far. To buy or not to buy The Pro is clearly positioned to go up against the iPad Pro and does have a lot to recommend it on that front – principally, it's a lot cheaper. However, the undetachable keyboard make the Samsung Pro a lot less fun to use as a tablet than its Apple rival. There are some nice design features, like the internally housed stylus, and a few bad ones too. The technical specs are disappointing, too – Chromebook watchers had been hoping for at least 8GB or 16GB of RAM in a so-called "Pro" laptop. Knock maybe $100 off the purchase price and the Chromebook Pro would be a good buy, but at $549 it's too much. An HDMI port would have been nice too, although Samsung will sell you an adaptor for that. In all, it's an adequate bit of kit. If you like Chrome OS, it's not a bad pick, and the Android integration is enabled but unfinished. One can't help feeling that it's a lot of money for just enough hardware. Slapping the word "Pro" on a laptop, and bunging in a stylus for good measure, doesn't mean you can just jack up the price: there has to be a justification. ® Tips and corrections 48 Comments More from The Register EU waves antitrust claims in Google's face, snarls 'You want some?'

Google Chromebook laptops are impractical for many people because they’re little more than expensive paperweights when they’re out of range of an internet connection. Yet they’ve defied expectations and made tremendous inroads in one of the least likely places: U.S. schools. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) More NEW YORK (AP) -- The Google Chromebook, a type of stripped-down laptop, isn't a practical mobile device for many people — mostly because it basically turns into an expensive paperweight whenever it can't find a Wi-Fi connection. Yet Chromebooks have defied expectations and made major inroads in an unexpected environment — U.S. schools. In retrospect, that shouldn't be too surprising. Chromebooks are cheap and easy to manage, making them popular with budget-constrained schools with limited tech-support staff. And Wi-Fi is now common enough in U.S. schools and homes to make an internet-dependent device practical for students. Google doesn't want to stop there. It's releasing new models in partnership with Samsung that are designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers. They have several tablet-like features, including a stylus, touch controls and a 360-degree hinge that allows you to turn the screen faceup. One starts selling Sunday for $449; a more powerful version comes out in April for $100 more. Google and its manufacturing partners are trying to shed the Chromebook's perception as underperforming budget devices. But even with premium models, expanding beyond U.S. schools won't be easy. CHROMEBOOKS GET SCHOOLED For personal computers and tablets, Chromebook's share of the U.S. education market was 49 percent last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2013, according to IDC figures released this week. But education accounts for just 14 percent of the 110 million devices shipped in the U.S. last year — and Chromebooks make up just 9 percent of that broader total. Their numbers are also low abroad, even in schools. The Chromebook's popularity in U.S. education is also largely limited to grades K-12, analysts say. Macs and Windows laptops are still dominant on college campuses. ROUGH START Chromebooks use a lightweight operating system designed to get people online faster, without having to wait around for the computer to start up. Much of the heavy lifting on Chromebooks gets done on Google's remote servers, so Chromebooks themselves don't need fast chips or lots of storage. Early on, though, that made Chromebooks seem cheap and underpowered, which "soured consumer expectations right off the bat," IDC analyst Linn Huang said. Online storage for photos and documents online was much less common in 2011 when Chromebooks launched , so their limited local storage was initially unappealing. And the few apps available for Chromebooks didn't work offline, at least at the time. DIFFERING NEEDS But what constrains consumers can actually be liberating in education. Most kids don't need laptops on the bus or other locations where they can't connect to Wi-Fi. And they don't miss business software like Microsoft Office; Google's online apps for documents and spreadsheets do just fine for homework. "What surprised us was how quickly it took off in education," said Kan Liu, who oversees Chromebooks at Google. Apple's iPad was hot at the time, but Google sold the Chromebook on convenience. They're easier for classrooms to share; just sign in with a Google account, and a student's apps and documents instantly appear. Teachers also have online tools to lock down what apps and sites students can use. And with models available for less than $200, schools can get a few Chromebooks for the price of an iPad or a rival laptop. "It allows us to put more devices in students' hands," said Aaron Slutsky, chief technology officer for McDowell County Schools in North Carolina. FAR FROM UNIVERSAL But Chromebook's success story in schools is largely an American one, and it's likely to stay that way. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa notes that Chromebooks are useless in China because the device depends on Google services that aren't available there. And in emerging countries, where a budget laptop would be ideal, she said internet access isn't reliable enough. Even in the U.S., the iPad is better for many creative tasks such as recording and editing movies. Students studying engineering, robotics and graphics won't be able to use Chromebooks to run the kind of specialized software that's available for Macs and Windows laptops. "But that's not needed for 98 percent of our students," said Tracy Dabbs, coordinator of technology and innovation at the Burlington-Edison School District near Seattle. Read More Many school districts limit Apple and Windows computers for the students who specifically need them, then provide Chromebooks for the rest. McDowell County, for instance, has 5,500 Chromebooks, 1,200 iPads — and only 100 Macs and 200 Windows PCs. RIVALS STAGE A COMEBACK Last year, Apple gave iPads in schools some Chromebook-like features unavailable to the general public. That includes ways to let multiple people use a single tablet and management tools for tech-support staff. A new Classroom app lets teachers control what apps students run and track their progress. Apple also provides classroom tools for teachers and students. Free e-books offer teachers step-by-step guides on using iPad apps and curriculum suggestions for everyday subjects. A separate app lets kids learn programming using the same language developers use to build iPad apps. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced last month new online apps and management tools for schools, along with Windows PCs priced similarly to Chromebooks. BEYOND SCHOOLS Huang said some businesses are giving Chromebooks a second look, especially in retail, banking and other settings where people share computers. But in many offices, the lack of business software such as Office is a major hurdle. Google's alternative lacks many advanced capabilities found in Office, and habits are hard to change. Google is trying to make Chromebooks more palatable by letting them run Android apps designed for phones and tablets. It's testing this capability on a handful of Chromebook models, including the new ones from Samsung. That makes it possible to install Office, Adobe Photoshop and many apps on a Chromebook, though these tablet versions have limited features compared with versions for Macs or Windows laptops.

Review: Acer Chromebook R 13 -- a... Review: Acer Chromebook 14 for Work... Asus Chromebook Flip review: A classy... For the most part, Chromebooks -- laptops that use Google's Chrome OS -- have been marketed as either lightweight and inexpensive student systems or low-end secondary machines for travel or family use. With one or two exceptions (such as Google's Pixel), the emphasis was on cheapness of both price and materials. Lately, however, more vendors have been introducing Chromebooks meant for mid-level business use. For example, the recently-released Acer Chromebook R 13 is a solid convertible that can handle day-to-day computing tasks (its sibling, the Acer Chromebook 14 for Work, is aimed even more directly at a business usership). Back in January during the CES trade show, Samsung announced two new laptops in this class: the Chromebook Plus, which will ship with an ARM processor, and Chromebook Pro, which is pretty much identical except that it will be powered by an Intel Core m3. I spent a couple of weeks with a pre-production model of the Pro; I was assured that, except for the color of the unit (it is silver, while the final will be black), it was identical to a production unit. And I've got to say, I was impressed. Like the Acer R 13, the Pro is a convertible, meaning that its touchscreen display can bend 360 degree, from a "closed laptop" position to a traditional typing position,  further back to a "tented" presentation position, and finally all the way back to a tablet position. [ Further reading: Singapore’s ‘city brain’ project is groundbreaking -- but what about privacy? ] The Pro comes with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. There is a USB-C slot on the right edge of the keyboard, along with the power and volume buttons; the left edge has a second USB-C slot, a headphone/mic jack and a microSD slot. Interesting display Instead of the usual 16:9 aspect ratio that most laptop displays (and TV manufacturers) offer, the 12.3-in. Pro display (like that of the Chromebook Pixel ) comes in a squarer 3:2 aspect ratio, one more conducive to browsing or document creation. The display takes a little getting used to if you're used to the wider screens, but as a business laptop, it works well. And because the convertible is not as wide as most 12-in. laptops (closed, it measures 11.06 x 8.72 x 0.55 in.), I found it easier to hold in its tablet configuration. The 2400 x 1600 Quad HD LED display did a fine job with several Netflix films and YouTube videos; the color was bright and rich, and it handled action and low-light scenes with little problem. The two stereo speakers located on either side of the bottom of the keyboard had good volume and reasonable fidelity. And when you watch videos on long flights, you'll able to do so confidently. In our battery test, which involves constantly running a variety of videos at 75% brightness, the Chromebook Pro lasted a little over 6 hours and 40 minutes; with normal usage, I wouldn't be surprised if you got at least a couple of days out of it before it needed recharging. Slotted stylus Another feature that distinguishes the Pro (and the Plus) is the inclusion of a simple stylus, about 4-3/8 in. long, which pops out of a slot on the right side of the keyboard.  According to Samsung, the new systems use a machine learning algorithm that pulls data from Google's indexing and OCR cloud databases to make handwritten notes searchable and to reduce latency (the time lag between when a pen touches screen and the "ink" stroke appears). I must admit I was skeptical, but much to my surprise, when I searched for words included in written notes on Google Keep (using my not-especially-clear handwriting), it worked nicely. (I also searched for some words that were not in the documents, and none of them came up in the search.)  The experience of using the stylus on the touchscreen was also impressive; the screen is very responsive and the act of drawing or writing -- which can be awkward if there is any kind of discernible time lag -- was smooth and felt very natural. There was still some lag, occasionally, but less than I've experienced on other touch systems, and that could improve by the time the Pro ships. That being said, the small size of the stylus makes it less than ideal for taking more than a few quick notes -- after a few minutes, my hand started feeling cramped. As a result, if you plan to do any extensive writing or drawing (and considering how well it feels to write on the display, you might), I'd invest in something more comfortable to hold. Performance and other features The Pro's all-metal chassis is sleek and attractive, and felt as though it would last, although the cover and bottom did bend in slightly when pressed. The keyboard had a good, solid feel and I had no trouble using it through long typing sessions; the medium-sized touchpad, while not as large as on most premium systems, was also comfortable to work with.  The Pro scored 20781 on the Octane 2.0 performance benchmark, which is in the general neighborhood of other Chromebooks running Intel Core m3 processors; I didn't experience any lag or other problems, even when running 10 or more browser tabs. Finally, Samsung's new Chromebooks are part of the generation that will work with Android apps; the review unit used a beta version of the App Store, but according to Samsung, the App Store for Chromebooks will have come out of beta by the time the Pro ships. While some Android apps may not be a perfect match for a larger display, the few I tried worked well. Bottom line In the weeks that I worked with the Samsung Chromebook Pro, I found it an excellent go-to computer for both travel and at-home use.  It is not inexpensive for a Chromebook -- it will be priced at $549 when it ships at the end of April (the Chromebook Plus, which will be available this coming Sunday, will list at $449). But for a good looking and performing Chromebook with a durable metal frame, comfortable keyboard and excellent touch display, along with the included stylus, you may find it worth the cost.

clock menu more-arrow Chromebook Pro: life in beta The nightmare before the dream by Dieter Bohn@backlon Feb 10, 2017, 9:00am EST share tweet Linkedin Let's talk about dreams. As a technology reviewer, I have weird ones — both literally and metaphorically. I spend a lot of time testing a wide array of gadgets, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. So the temptation arises to look at them and wish that this tablet could have that laptop's browser or this smartwatch could have that phone's connectivity features. The engineers at Google apparently dream the same way, because they have been spending the last six months or so bringing Android apps to Chrome OS. Android phones have a ton of great apps, but their web browsers pale in comparison to what you can get on a Chromebook. And vice versa: web apps are great, but there are times when it's just not enough, you need a "real" app. This new hybrid system that Google is creating is not a full merging of the two operating systems (which is starting to look less realistic and less desirable by the day), but it could provide all the benefits people dream of when they ask Google to merge Chrome OS and Android. The new Chromebook Pro is the convertible laptop that's supposed to be the first true manifestation of that dream. It's a $549, Intel-based device coming out in April. And maybe by then, it will be the dream made real. But because its software is still in beta right now, it's not a dream at all. It's the other thing. It's a nightmare. This is not a review of the Samsung Chromebook Pro. It's not a review because the Chromebook Pro is not ready to be reviewed yet. What you're about to read is just a story about what technology is like when you're living on the bleeding edge, a tale about software that will (hopefully) ever only be inflicted on tech reviewers and engineers. Beta software is a funny thing. The default advice I give people is to avoid it, but sometimes the siren call of something new and exciting is too much, and often betas are totally usable. Early betas of iOS are too unstable for daily use, but the later ones generally aren't that bad. Same applies for Android betas lately. And heck, once upon a time even stalwart apps like Gmail kept the beta label on for five years. For consumer use, there are good betas and there are bad betas. There are good betas and bad betas. This is a bad beta Another example of a pretty good beta is the software on the Chromebook Plus, the companion device to the one I'm writing about here. It, too, features Android software, but since it has an ARM processor that software is a little less buggy. And since the Plus is theoretically a lower-end device and getting released with that beta software, its foibles are slightly more forgivable. I've reviewed the Chromebook Plus in full here. I'm belaboring all this because what I'm about to describe to you is an experience that you will hopefully never have as a consumer — assuming Google gets its act together. Again, this Chromebook Pro isn't coming out until April, and between now and then Google has insisted to me that everything I'm about to describe is both a known issue and will be fixed. Luckily, Google is working off a very good foundation. Samsung has manufactured a great Chromebook. The Chromebook Pro has a gorgeous touchscreen, a thin metal frame, and an accurate trackpad. The keyboard is good — but sadly not backlit — and it comes with a stylus. The only real difference between the Chromebook Pro and the Chromebook Plus is that the Pro has a more powerful Intel processor. There's one cosmetic difference, too: the Pro will be black when it's released; the photos and video you see here are of a silver preproduction unit. Taken just as a Chrome OS device, running the Chrome browser and web apps, I think the Chromebook Pro is going to be great. It can handle running nearly 20 tabs before it starts to slow down, and has a battery that just won't quit. What slowdowns I have experienced have come because there are problems with the Android software that can sometimes affect the rest of the OS. So let's get into the Android app situation. The way Android on Chrome OS works is something like this: Android apps expect to see Android hardware, so Chrome OS acts as a software layer that provides those Android apps everything they need: Wi-Fi, RAM, time from the processor, etc. It's not really emulation, it's more deeply integrated than that. So, for example, Android notifications are fully integrated into Chrome OS's own notification tray. You can also copy / paste from Chrome tabs into Android apps and vice versa. Android can run on both ARM and Intel processors, but the vast majority of Android apps expect to have an ARM processor. That means that the more complex apps — like games — are optimized for ARM and have to be translated on the fly to run on Intel. Chrome OS does that work for them, but it's not really good at it yet. Google itself suggested we try out a game that is pretty commonly used to see if Android devices can display graphics well: 2013’s Asphalt 8. So I dutifully did and the Chromebook Pro dutifully did its best to run the game. But it couldn't keep up with the game engine. The game sputtered along with so many frame rate drops that I literally couldn't steer the car. I kept crashing in the game. The apps crashed, too. Games like Final Fantasy 7 simply wouldn't load. Other apps would open, hang, and die. There are some memory leak problems, too — which means that Android apps would go rogue and start taking up more RAM than they're supposed to, bogging the whole system down. I also ran into performance issues with a key new feature of the Chromebook Pro: the stylus. The input lag borders on unacceptable. It's not just that opening up the main app designed for stylus input — Google Keep — is an invitation to take a break and get a cup of coffee. It's that when you start writing or drawing, the digital ink can sometimes be as much as a second behind where your stylus is on the screen. Stylus input should be measured in milliseconds. Google is working on this, too, and will release a version that uses machine learning to mitigate that lag by predicting which pixels are getting drawn on the fly. The problems go beyond performance, though. There's also the user interface. Right now, Android apps can't be resized like other windows. They can only be displayed in one of a few different sizes: full screen, phone size, or tablet size. Switching between them is kind of a hassle, and I would spend agonizing seconds watching each app reposition and reorient itself. The reason behind the weird window size thing is that this beta is running the last version of Android, Marshmallow. Google is working furiously to get the latest version of Android, Nougat, running on Chrome OS. When it does, you'll be able to resize windows to whatever size you want — provided developers have updated their apps to support it. Once Nougat arrives, both Android apps and Chrome OS itself will be able to pull off tricks they can't now. The clearest example is tablet mode. Right now, when you flip the screen around every window automatically goes full screen. There's no way to put things in windows or into split screen. There's also a bug where Chrome windows don't remember where they're supposed to be on the screen when you reopen them after closing them. Will Android apps ever be good on big screens? I'd like to tell you that everything will be hunky-dory once Nougat arrives, but the problem goes much deeper than that. The real problem is that the thing we've been complaining about with Android apps on big screens for literally five years now is still a huge problem. Most Android apps — including many apps that are made by Google itself — look absolutely atrocious on a large screen. Again, Google is promising that this problem will be mitigated or fixed with Nougat, because there will be more tools for developers to resize their apps and because Google is making a big push to get them to do so. I'd like to believe Google on this, but I'm also five years into hearing these kinds of promises without results. Perhaps Chrome OS with Android will be popular enough to entice developers into doing it. But I’m not confident it will be. Last but certainly not least, Android apps were designed for a phone world, where resources are scant. There are a few standout apps that feel a little more desktop class than others (specifically, Microsoft's Office suite and a few of Adobe's newer apps), but most of them feel and act like what they are: phone apps on a laptop. If Google wants Chrome OS to take on cheap Windows laptops, it needs to do better. I spent an hour talking with the engineers behind Chrome OS about every single one of these and plenty of other issues. In every single case, they told me they were aware of them and actively working on them. I believe them, and because the Chromebook Pro isn't getting released until April, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that this will all be resolved upon release. I'll give the Chromebook Pro a proper review then, so again, don't take this cavalcade of complaints as a indicative of what consumers will experience. What you should take away from this experience is that it's not always a great idea to put beta software on the devices you use and depend on every day. Also: that the merging of mobile apps and true desktop web apps may sound wonderful and maybe even inevitable, but, for lack of a better phrase, it’s complicated. I like cookie dough, but it can make you sick. Usually, it's better to wait until everything is fully baked.

Nathan Ingraham, @nateingraham 20h ago in Personal Computing Comments 466 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Samsung's forthcoming Chromebook Pro, which the company introduced in partnership with Google at CES last month, appeared to be the latest contender in my search for the perfect premium Chromebook. For me, that means a high-resolution screen, excellent keyboard and trackpad, and a battery that lasts all day. I'm also looking for a well-designed machine, not the cheap, netbook-inspired computers that were the hallmark of earlier Chromebooks. On the surface, the Chromebook Pro offers all of that, along with a few new hardware and software tricks. It's the first Chromebook specifically designed with the Google Play Store and Android apps in mind. It's also the first Chrome OS device with a stylus, and Google added new features to its Keep note-taking app to make it work with a pen. Samsung and Google claim that the machine learning prediction should remove latency to the point that it feels like writing on the Surface Pro 4 -- one of the best stylus experiences available. Gallery: Samsung Chromebook Pro pre-production model | 9 Photos 9 +5 Of course, more than a quick CES demo is needed to see how the Chromebook Pro stacks up -- so I've been putting the device through the wringer over the last week and a half. However, this is not a formal review. Samsung provided reviewers with pre-production units; the final, finished product (which will ship in black, not the silver you see in these photos) won't ship until the end of April. With a few months to go, I wanted to give Samsung and Google some advice on what they can improve between now and launch time. When the Chromebook Pro eventually hits the market, we'll revisit it in the form of a scored review. The biggest issue with the Chromebook Pro also happens to be its most unique feature. The combination of stylus (which is basically identical to what you'd find in Samsung's Galaxy Note phones) and pressure-sensitive display is currently way too laggy to be useful. During a joint demonstration for reporters late last month, Samsung and Google specifically said how lag kills the experience of writing on a screen -- but right now, I'm always waiting for the screen to catch up with my pen strokes. Yes, I can technically take notes on this screen, but it's not the experience Google promised. And it's definitely not as good as the input experience on an iPad Pro or Surface Pro 4. At this point, I've pretty much given up on using the Chromebook's pen. It's important to note that Google says it hasn't yet turned on the machine learning writing assist in the version of Chrome OS that I'm running. That's part of the problem with using a pre-production machine: Some things just aren't ready yet, making the device difficult to evaluate. As it stands, this potentially unique feature adds nothing to the experience. Another problem is how Chrome OS plays with Android apps. This feature has been in the works for months, but it still doesn't feel ready for prime time; there are issues with both performance and implementation. Performance simply needs to be better for it to be worth running these apps alongside standard Chrome apps. Tools that I use daily (e.g., Google Play Music, Wunderlist, Pocket, Netflix, Google Calendar, Inbox and Google Docs) worked just fine -- but in most cases, the web versions were faster and better optimized for laptops than their Android counterparts. What's more, the games I tried (including Alto's Adventure, Dots & Co, Rayman's Adventure and the Google-recommended Asphalt 8) all felt laggy compared to how they run on Android phones and tablets. Consistently dropping frames when playing games is a big problem that defeats the purpose of playing them in the first place. The good news is that performance seems to have improved in the few weeks I've been using the Chromebook Pro, thanks to a series of software updates. Google will be gathering data on the Play Store and Android app usage in the next few months -- the Samsung Chromebook Plus (a laptop that's identical to the Pro with the exception of a weaker ARM processor) hits stores this Sunday, with the beta Play Store included. Hopefully the company will continue to optimize Android performance over the next few months before the Pro launches. There's also the simple matter of what the experience of using Android apps on a Chromebook will be like for first-time buyers. By default, a Chromebook's app drawer is loaded up with what are essentially web-app links for Google services likes Docs, Drive, Gmail, Keep and Photos, among others. But you can also download those same apps from the Play Store. If you want offline access to Google Play Music or Movies, for example, you'll need the Android apps. But the rest of the time, the web versions seem to work better. They were designed for traditional desktop computers, after all. Users can also end up with multiple versions of the same app and not really know which is which, or which is better to use. For example, I've used the Wunderlist Chrome app for a long time, but I also installed the Android version to see which is better. The website feels more fluid to me, but the Android app pops up notifications for my reminders. That's quite helpful for a reminders app, but using the Chrome version is generally a better experience. Which should I use? Running Android apps on Chrome OS is a lot like using an Android tablet: The whole experience just isn't optimized for a bigger screen. The Hangouts Android app, even when full-screen, is just one giant pane showing either your list of ongoing conversations or the details of whatever chat you're in. The Chrome app, on the other hand, has two panes, making it much easier to jump between threads. Similarly, I thought having Facebook Messenger running in a small vertical window on the side of my screen might be handy. But you can't resize the app, it only runs in portrait mode, and tapping enter doesn't actually send a message. You instead need to click on the "send" button, which slows things down. All told, my experience running Android apps was mixed at best. Generally, most web services are good enough at this point that the experience is superior to running Android on a laptop. The obvious exception is offline mode, but I'm offline infrequently enough that this didn't change my opinion. I still think there's potential here, but a good amount of refinement is needed, along with a tutorial to help new buyers understand when to use Android apps versus web apps. Another thing I hope to see Samsung and Google improve is the Chromebook Pro's battery life. The computer is rated for eight hours of usage, but I typically got little more than six. And the computer takes a long time to charge -- more than two and a half hours to go from three percent to full. That said, 90 minutes got me to about 88 percent, which was more than enough for another half-day of work. Although the battery itself is likely to be the same at launch, perhaps further software optimizations will get the computer to that eight-hour mark. To end on a positive note, I think it's worth discussing some of the things that the Chromebook Pro does right. For starters, the form factor hits all the right note for me. While Samsung's design language hasn't changed much over the years, it nonetheless makes for a pleasing look. The rounded corners make it comfortable both for typing and carrying -- and they also give it a distinctive aesthetic that helps keep the laptop from looking like yet another MacBook Air clone. That quality isn't skin-deep either. The Chromebook Pro feels much more sturdy than HP's similarly priced Chromebook 13. The all-important keyboard and trackpad are similarly reliable. They both feel slightly cramped compared to my MacBook Air, but the keys themselves are responsive and there's nothing wrong with the trackpad aside from being a little small. The 2,400 x 1,600 display is also a highlight. It's bright and sharp, and features the same 3:2 aspect ratio as the now-discontinued Chromebook Pixel. That might mean wider black bars when you're watching a movie, but the majority of the time I really appreciated the extra vertical screen real estate. The laptop's default 1,200 x 800 scaled resolution means most UI elements are pretty large, but scaling things up to 1,350 x 900 gave me more room for my content. The hinge in particular feels both strong and smooth, with no sticking or hitches as it moves from laptop to tablet mode. And while software problems made writing on the screen less than ideal, the hardware side of the equation is actually pretty good. There's a slight bit of resistance when using the stylus that makes it feel more like a writing instrument on paper and less like a stylus sliding across slick glass. Given this computer's pre-production status, I'm not ready to say whether or not it's worth the $550 asking price. That will depend on how much Google improves the software experience over the next few months. Simply turning on the machine learning feature should make using the stylus much smoother, and Google will continue optimizing Android app performance in the coming weeks. But it remains to be seen if this is the Chromebook that will convince people to pay a more premium price. I'm cautiously optimistic because I've been looking for a higher-quality Chromebook for a while. But if you just want an inexpensive laptop for getting things done, there are plenty of cheaper options available now. For the time being, those of you who want a premium Chromebook should wait until April to decide if Samsung deserves your cash.

Google’s affordable “just a browser” devices are the best-selling computers in schools, and they’re percolating around boardrooms and cubicles. Last fall, more people bought Chromebooks than Macs—and that’s not going to switch back anytime soon. Now Google’s out to convince you, regular human, person of sound mind and reasonable budget, that you ought to buy a Chromebook. Samsung Chromebook Pro 6/10 Learn How We Rate Wired Lighter, thinner, and better-looking than most laptops this price. Screen works great for touch and pen input. The battery truly lasts all day. Tired Buggier than I thought a Chromebook could even be. Android apps don't quite mesh right with Chrome OS. You can barely hear the speakers. Buy It Now   |  Samsung How We Rate 1/10A complete failure in every way 2/10Sad, really 3/10Serious flaws; proceed with caution 4/10Downsides outweigh upsides 5/10Recommended with reservations 6/10Solid with some issues 7/10Very good, but not quite great 8/10Excellent, with room to kvetch 9/10Nearly flawless 10/10Metaphysical perfection The consumer Chromebook onslaught starts with Samsung’s Chromebook Plus and Pro, which are on paper the most well-rounded Chrome OS devices ever. The Plus starts at $450 and is available next week, and the Pro will be $550 when it ships in March. Both fit right into the normal-person laptop budget. They do all the Chrome OS things, have great and flippy touchscreens, and even support pen input. And best of all, they run all of the millions of apps in Google’s Play Store. They’re part smartphone, part tablet, part laptop, combined in a way that feels like the computer of the future. I’ve been using the Pro for the last couple of weeks. Like I said, it sounds great… on paper. In reality, this brilliantly polymorphic computer still feels more like a science experiment. The Good Kind of Cheap It shouldn’t be that hard to make a good laptop. Most people want the same things: A relatively light and thin body, attractive enough you don’t mind being seen with it in public. Well-spaced, clicky keyboard, and spacious, smooth trackpad. High-res screen, and enough power and battery to get you through even an extra-long day at work. Pretty straightforward, right? According to your average $500 Best Buy Special, this is very hard. The Chromebook Pro proves it’s at least possible. At about a half-inch thick and 2.38 pounds, it’s smaller than almost every laptop not named MacBook. It doesn’t ooze class and wealth every time you open the lid, but the magnesium alloy body (mine’s silver, but yours will be black) at least won’t look out of place in Economy Comfort. Even more so once you peel off the unsightly Energy Star sticker. The rounded edges and exposed hinge give it a decidedly utilitarian look—you’re not holding a future Smithsonian exhibit in your hands, you’re holding a laptop. And that’s just fine. The 12.3-inch, 2400×1600 display is excellent, and works well as a touchscreen too. But it really shines when you pop the tiny stylus out of the body of the Chromebook Pro. The stylus matches the one in Samsung’s Galaxy Note phones, and works just as well: you can draw, doodle, take notes, the whole nine. Google’s Keep note-taking app supports the pen as an input tool, and works fabulously. Trust me: there’s nothing quite so futuristic as signing a contract right on your computer screen. Read More David Pierce How Chromebooks Are About to Totally Transform Laptop Design David Pierce Want a Peek at the Future of Laptops? Check Out Samsung’s New Chromebooks David Pierce Review: HP Chromebook 13 David Pierce Attention, College Students: Chromebooks Are About to Get Awesome Gordon Gottsegen Android and Chromebooks Are Taking Over The whole kit runs on Intel’s Core M3 processor and four gigs of RAM. (The Chromebook Plus, which comes out next week and costs $450, runs on a lower-powered OP1 chip.) It has 32 gigs of internal storage, plus a microSD slot for adding more. None of those specs really matter, because power’s not an issue here and rarely ever is one on Chromebooks as a whole. The Chrome browser is so stable on these machines that it can handle more tabs and apps than my MacBook Pro. Not to mention, I get upwards of ten hours on the battery before I have to charge it. I used it basically non-stop during an hour-long train ride and six hours of flights, and still had plenty of battery left to watch The Good Place before bed. When you open the Pro’s lid, you’ll notice it never really stops opening. You can flip the screen a full 360 degrees, turning your laptop into a tablet. An awkward tablet, since the keyboard’s sitting right there on the back underneath your fingers, but a tablet nonetheless. It also sits sturdily like a teepee or like a digital picture frame, keyboard-down, both of which I used a lot—I sometimes watch Netflix while I cook, and it’s nice being able to hide the keyboard and trackpad from splattering olive oil. The downside of the 360-degree screen is that in order to accommodate all the ways you can hold it, Samsung had to make some weird layout choices. The power button’s on the right side, for instance, where I guarantee you’ll hit it by accident at least once a day. The headphone jack’s in the right place in laptopping (left side, at the rear) and thus bizarrely positioned for every other mode. Those are all necessary compromises for this form factor. I like it, so I’ll take the compromises. I only have two true hardware problems: the speakers are terrible, and the keyboard isn’t backlit. Which is just stupid. But even with those issues, you won’t find better laptop hardware for this price. It’s thin, it’s fast enough, it’s long-lasting, it looks like a laptop made this decade. For $550, that’s a minor miracle. Samsung Harder Than It Looks The hardware works, but the Chromebook Pro’s software doesn’t. Google says everything will be fine before the device formally launches in April, and I have no reason to believe that’s not true. But from what I’ve seen so far, this hyper-versatile software trails way behind the hardware. Evidently combining Android and Chrome OS wasn’t as easy as it sounds. Some apps don’t recognize the keyboard and trackpad; others seem unable to handle a touchscreen. Some apps steadfastly refuse to connect to the internet. Most crash constantly, when they even open at all. Games beyond Solitaire-level complexity won’t run at all, not even on this more powerful model. Three times so far, the Chromebook Pro has crashed so spectacularly that I got a dozen error messages and the whole machine shut down. The whole point of a Chromebook is that things like that never happen. Evidently combining Android and Chrome OS wasn’t as easy as it sounds. Then there are the bugs. Oh, the bugs! Like the one where you flip the screen over to put the Pro in tent mode, and all your browser tabs disappear for no reason. Or how when you’re in tablet mode and try to put it to sleep, you just can’t. My favorite is the one where you open an app, and it just sits there flickering on the screen, forever trapped closing and opening. Again, Google seems well aware of these problems, and most appear to be fixable bugs. I’ll revisit this review closer to the launch, and I hope the story gets better. Right now, if I use a Chromebook Pro like other Chromebooks—tabs not apps, and laptop not tablet—it works great. It’s a light, thin, long-lasting, slightly expensive Chromebook. That’s just a much smaller vision than what this thing could be. It should let me play Netflix on one side and keep my dinner recipe up on the other. It should let me check Instagram and Snapchat right next to my work email. I should be playing Candy Crush and Asphalt 8 while I’m pretending to work. Instead it’s still just a web browser. That’s frustrating, because the Chromebook Pro was supposed to be the shape-shifting future of computing, Google’s answer to everything from the iPad Pro to the Surface Studio. It was supposed to be the first Chromebook that made no compromises, that was both secure and powerful, fast and feature-rich. Android apps and Chrome OS were a match made in heaven, a perfect way for smartphone owners to get into the laptop world. The hardware’s there: Samsung proved you can make the right kind of laptop at an attractive price, and I hope every other PC manufacturer is taking notes. But on the software side, it’s clearly unfinished. Luckily, you get to wait and see if Google fixes the Pro’s many problems. I’ll be back here to let you know how that goes. But for right now, know this: the dream of the just-right Chromebook is alive inside this machine, but it’s still just out of reach. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Google Now is Going Down; Top Five Alternates to Pick From February 10, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Microsoft Ushers In New Picture-in-Picture Mode in Windows 10  Lenovo Yoga A12 is an Android Tablet Packed with the Pros of a Laptop Google will shortly have its much beloved Google Now launcher taken down from the Play Store. Support for the launcher will still be provided, but it’s quite clear that Google’s interests are inclined towards the newer member of the family, the Pixel launcher. Users can expect little updates on their way ahead with Google Now launcher. Many would sure hang on with Google Now. But it’s not bad to look beyond Google, as there are many other launchers that provide equal, or rather better, features and options than Google Now. Listed below are a few of them. Nova Launcher Nova Launcher is one of the most, if not the most popular launcher among customizers for quite a long time in the market. And it still manages to retain its popularity, thanks to the continuous updates it has been receiving to keep its customization features expanding. On top of that, Nova Launcher comes sans any big graphical tweaks that let its function smooth on even devices with lower specs. That doesn’t mean there aren’t any animations at all. With various gesture control and neat categorization, Nova Launcher should not disappoint you if picking it as the replacement for Google Now. The app comes free of charges, but unlocking certain features might require users to make the jump to the Prime version, which comes with a charge of $4.99. Download from Play Store Action Launcher 3 Action Launcher is one app to look forward if you are savvy of the Google features, like having the Pixie Pill and the date widget. Interestingly, they can be customized to match your tunes. Moreover, there is also a quick theme option that automatically shuffles your homepage based on your wallpaper. Action Launcher 3 is also backed by a host of quick-access shortcuts like an intriguing cover feature, gesture support and more. The app was also awarded Google Play’s app of the year back in 2015. Download from Play Store Cheetah Launcher Cheetah launcher is not the name that would show up if you are opting for a customizable launcher. But this one definitely is worth a look for the simplicity it offers. Along with that simplicity, users also get greater speed that takes up only half the RAM of many other launchers available in the market. But that said, Cheetah is not devoid of customization options, and there are plenty of themes to go through. One interesting feature is its intelligence that automatically places the most frequently used apps onto your home screen for easy access. Download from Play Store  Arrow Launcher Arrow Launcher comes from the house of Microsoft. Interestingly, Arrow Launcher isn’t that launcher that can be put under competition with the rest. Instead, it resides in its own space of app arrangement and app fetching. Arrow Launcher is powerful enough to fetch your most recently apps like calls and messages, and it can also get your app drawer customized according to those. Besides, this is also a good choice for those engaged with documentation works as Arrow Launcher comes pre-loaded with quick access to Office documents on the cloud. Download from Play Store ADW 2 ADW Launcher is another fan-favorite in Google Play Store.

One that is capable of multi-tasking with the best of them, or running any app or game available on the Google Play Store. However, there’s times when closing all of those running apps could be useful. Advertisement This may seem like a simple task for most smartphone users, especially if you’ve used Android before, but with the Galaxy S4 selling millions of units and stealing old Blackberry or iOS users, this question comes up more times than you’d think. For all those average smartphone users wondering how to close and clear running apps on the Galaxy S4, we have the details below. While the general Android rule of thumb is to let the operating system manage your memory, not to mention Samsung’s Galaxy S4 comes with 2GB of RAM, there’s still times a user may want to clear no longer used but open apps from the memory. Google’s Android OS does an excellent job managing apps and multi-tasking, putting apps in a low-power state ready to be called into action with ease, and more. That said, many users still opt to close apps manually. Whether this is to free up RAM, kill a process like Google Maps that could be draining that all-important battery life, or other reasons, here’s the simple steps. You’ll simply need to tap a few buttons and you’ll be done in no time. It’s so simple many people know how already, but if you don’t here’s how. Instructions The Samsung Galaxy S4 (and most Samsung devices) have a dedicated rectangle home button on the bottom front of the device, and you’ll want to long press that home key. From here you’ll see the multi-tasking menu, which is great for going from YouTube to Gmail and back with ease, but this is also where you kill and close running apps. Advertisement This screen actually varies from carrier to carrier in the US, slightly, for some odd reason, but the steps remain the same. After long-pressing home you’ll see icons or Task Manager, Google (Now), and Close all apps at the bottom of the display. The left “X” symbol is close all, and you can simply tap this to close all currently running apps. It’s that easy, and a simple tap will close all the apps that are currently open on your Samsung Galaxy S4 or other Galaxy devices. However, many users may not want to close all apps, but just something like Google Maps, navigation, Netflix, or something else that could be draining the battery. Read: How to Cut, Copy & Paste on Android Closing just one app is even easier. Once a user long-presses home you’ll see the icons detailed above, as well as tons of tiles giving you a live preview of each open application. You can scroll through this list if there’s more than a few, and simply swipe away each individual app and running program. A swipe of the finger and the app closes. Advertisement Now the rule of thumb part mentioned above is because Android handles memory and running apps beautifully, and sometimes killing all these processes can actually lower battery life. Simply because the phone will restart some of these apps, or if you close the camera only to open it 20 minutes later, you’ve wasted processes and battery life. So as a rule of thumb it’s only necessary to close big or processor-intensive apps, or maybe clear all before heading to bed for the night. Users claim all types of different results for clearing apps through the app and task manager, but use it wisely and feel free to try it yourself today. 5 Responses 09/10/2014 Brian Reply Very Helpful thanks you.

Yet Chromebooks have defied expectations and made major inroads in an unexpected environment — U.S. schools. In retrospect, that shouldn't be too surprising. Chromebooks are cheap and easy to manage, making them popular with budget-constrained schools with limited tech-support staff. And Wi-Fi is now common enough in U.S. schools and homes to make an internet-dependent device practical for students.

Google Chromebook laptops are impractical for many people because they¿re little more than expensive paperweights when they¿re out of range of an internet connection. Yet they¿ve defied expectations and made tremendous inroads in one of the least likely places: U.S. schools. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Google doesn't want to stop there. It's releasing new models in partnership with Samsung that are designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers. They have several tablet-like features, including a stylus, touch controls and a 360-degree hinge that allows you to turn the screen faceup. One starts selling Sunday for $449; a more powerful version comes out in April for $100 more. Google and its manufacturing partners are trying to shed the Chromebook's perception as underperforming budget devices. But even with premium models, expanding beyond U.S. schools won't be easy. CHROMEBOOKS GET SCHOOLED For personal computers and tablets, Chromebook's share of the U.S. education market was 49 percent last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2013, according to IDC figures released this week. But education accounts for just 14 percent of the 110 million devices shipped in the U.S. last year — and Chromebooks make up just 9 percent of that broader total. Their numbers are also low abroad, even in schools. The Chromebook's popularity in U.S. education is also largely limited to grades K-12, analysts say. Macs and Windows laptops are still dominant on college campuses. ROUGH START Chromebooks use a lightweight operating system designed to get people online faster, without having to wait around for the computer to start up. Much of the heavy lifting on Chromebooks gets done on Google's remote servers, so Chromebooks themselves don't need fast chips or lots of storage. Early on, though, that made Chromebooks seem cheap and underpowered, which "soured consumer expectations right off the bat," IDC analyst Linn Huang said. Online storage for photos and documents online was much less common in 2011 when Chromebooks launched , so their limited local storage was initially unappealing. And the few apps available for Chromebooks didn't work offline, at least at the time. DIFFERING NEEDS But what constrains consumers can actually be liberating in education. Most kids don't need laptops on the bus or other locations where they can't connect to Wi-Fi. And they don't miss business software like Microsoft Office; Google's online apps for documents and spreadsheets do just fine for homework. "What surprised us was how quickly it took off in education," said Kan Liu, who oversees Chromebooks at Google. Apple's iPad was hot at the time, but Google sold the Chromebook on convenience. They're easier for classrooms to share; just sign in with a Google account, and a student's apps and documents instantly appear. Teachers also have online tools to lock down what apps and sites students can use. And with models available for less than $200, schools can get a few Chromebooks for the price of an iPad or a rival laptop. "It allows us to put more devices in students' hands," said Aaron Slutsky, chief technology officer for McDowell County Schools in North Carolina. FAR FROM UNIVERSAL But Chromebook's success story in schools is largely an American one, and it's likely to stay that way. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa notes that Chromebooks are useless in China because the device depends on Google services that aren't available there. And in emerging countries, where a budget laptop would be ideal, she said internet access isn't reliable enough. Even in the U.S., the iPad is better for many creative tasks such as recording and editing movies. Students studying engineering, robotics and graphics won't be able to use Chromebooks to run the kind of specialized software that's available for Macs and Windows laptops. "But that's not needed for 98 percent of our students," said Tracy Dabbs, coordinator of technology and innovation at the Burlington-Edison School District near Seattle. Many school districts limit Apple and Windows computers for the students who specifically need them, then provide Chromebooks for the rest. McDowell County, for instance, has 5,500 Chromebooks, 1,200 iPads — and only 100 Macs and 200 Windows PCs. RIVALS STAGE A COMEBACK Last year, Apple gave iPads in schools some Chromebook-like features unavailable to the general public. That includes ways to let multiple people use a single tablet and management tools for tech-support staff. A new Classroom app lets teachers control what apps students run and track their progress. Apple also provides classroom tools for teachers and students. Free e-books offer teachers step-by-step guides on using iPad apps and curriculum suggestions for everyday subjects. A separate app lets kids learn programming using the same language developers use to build iPad apps. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced last month new online apps and management tools for schools, along with Windows PCs priced similarly to Chromebooks. BEYOND SCHOOLS Huang said some businesses are giving Chromebooks a second look, especially in retail, banking and other settings where people share computers. But in many offices, the lack of business software such as Office is a major hurdle. Google's alternative lacks many advanced capabilities found in Office, and habits are hard to change. Google is trying to make Chromebooks more palatable by letting them run Android apps designed for phones and tablets. It's testing this capability on a handful of Chromebook models, including the new ones from Samsung. That makes it possible to install Office, Adobe Photoshop and many apps on a Chromebook, though these tablet versions have limited features compared with versions for Macs or Windows laptops.

Samsung took the wraps off two new additions to its Chromebook line at CES 2017 that were built in collaboration with Google: the Chromebook Pro and the Chromebook Plus. There are a few special features that make these devices stand out from the crowd, with both not only being the first new Chromebooks to feature support for Android applications via the Google Play Store, but they also include an S-Pen-like stylus. Samsung and Google claim the addition of the stylus will take these laptops to new levels in terms of productivity and multimedia. Will these new features and everything else these devices have to offer be enough for people to reconsider Chromebooks as more than just glorified web browsing machines? Let’s find out, in this comprehensive Samsung Chromebook Pro review! Design We saw quite a few Chromebooks at CES this year, but Samsung’s offerings were some of the most appealing at the show and will definitely be among the more high-end options you’ll be able to get your hands on this year. While this review will focus on the Samsung Chromebook Pro, there is also the Chromebook Plus that is aesthetically and functionally identical. The only difference between the two is the fact that while the Pro features the more powerful Intel Core m3 processor, the Plus comes with an ARM processor instead. In terms of design, the laptop features an all metal build that gives these Chromebooks a very high-end look and feel. Even with its metal construction, the device is extremely light, with a weight of just 2.38 lb, and it is also quite thin, with a thickness of just 13.9 mm. Its light weight, thinness and compact size means that it can easily fit in a backpack or messenger bag without weighing you down. Of course, if you tend to carry your laptop around in your hand, its diminutive size and weight make it that much more comfortable than a normal laptop. Portability is easily one of the best aspects of the Chromebook Pro/Plus. Given the size limitations, it’s understandable that the Chromebook Pro doesn’t have the largest keyboard or trackpad, but Samsung has actually done a pretty decent job with them. The keyboard is still spacious enough to comfortably type on, and the chicklet-style keys have a fair amount of travel. Also, if you look closely, you’ll notice that the keys have a slight curve to them, that helps avoid key mis-strokes by making them better contoured to your fingers. The trackpad also works well for the most part, and while there were no issues with it in particular, I do wish it had “pinch to zoom” functionality. The tactile feedback could also be better, as you don’t really get that satisfying click when you press down on it. Of course, you can use light taps instead, which means that you won’t have to actually press down on the trackpad all that often. Display The Chromebook Pro comes with a 12.3-inch LED screen with a Quad HD resolution of 2400 x 1600. If you are wondering why the resolution seems a little bit different, that is because this display features a 3:2 aspect ratio, which gives you more vertical space to work with in landscape orientation, which is great when doing things like reading web articles, but it also gives you a wider screen when using the device in portrait orientation. Given that this is a Samsung device, it’s no surprise that the display is rich, vibrant, and has great colors. The viewing angles are extremely wide, and the brightness also isn’t an issue if you’re using the laptop outside. The coolest part though is that the display can be rotated a full 360 degrees on its hinge. This lets you prop up the Chromebook Pro in a tent position, which is ideal for watching videos and movies on YouTube, Netflix, and the like, but you can also fold it back completely and use the device like a tablet. Performance As mentioned, the Chromebook Pro is powered by an Intel Core m3 processor backed up by 4 GB of RAM and, as expected, its performance is very smooth. Even with a lot of tabs open, it didn’t show any signs of lag or slowing down, and you won’t have any issues using ChromeOS to its full potential. However, performance does falter a bit when it comes to running Android apps, but that likely has more to do with the integration of the apps themselves rather than a problem with the processing package. Hardware Despite how thin the Chromebook Pro is, it still comes with a decent number of ports. On the left is the headphone and mic jack, a USB Type-C port, and a microSD card slot to let you bolster the 32 GB of built-in storage that is available. On the right side is the power button, the volume rocker and a second USB Type-C port. Both the USB Type-C ports can be used for charging the device, data transfer or to output 4K content to an external monitor or TV. It certainly helps that these ports are available on either side, which lets you choose which is more convenient for charging the Chromebook based on the placement of the wall outlet, and you don’t have to take the device off the charger if you need to use the USB port for something else. On the right side is something that you won’t normally see on a Chromebook, and that is a stylus. The stylus looks exactly like the S-Pen seen with the Samsung Galaxy Note line, with it being the same size and featuring the same tip, and it also into its slot with a click. The only real difference here is that this stylus doesn’t have a button on the side, but it still uses electromagnetic resonance (EMR) technology. The stylus adds a lot of functionality to the Chromebook Pro, some of which is similar to what was available with the now recalled Galaxy Note 7. You can use it to capture a specific portion of the screen, take a screenshot, use it as a magnifying glass or even use it as a laser pointer, which lets you move the stylus around the screen without interacting with any of the on-screen content. Of course, you can also draw and write with the stylus, and there is a direct integration with Google Keep to facilitate this. There is built-in optical character recognition (OCR), so any time you write a note, you can have it converted to regular text, or conduct a search for any notes you’ve previously written. While this a convenient feature, it can be quite buggy. The conversion to regular text can be 100% accurate sometimes, but more often than not, it doesn’t recognize all the handwritten text, or it only converts part of what is written. The big question here is whether the stylus actually adds any value to the Chromebook Pro. While the majority of my usage with the stylus has consisted of using it as a surrogate finger, I do think that a stylus makes much more sense on this type of device than it does on a phone. On the few occasions where I needed to jot down something, I was able to write comfortably on the screen and rest my palm on it without worrying about blocking what I was trying to write, courtesy of having more screen real estate to work with. The biggest Achilles’ heel of the Chromebook Pro is the speakers. You will find two speaker grills sitting on the bottom towards the corners. This placement is definitely more intended for using them when the Chromebook is in the tent position for media consumption, since in the regular laptop mode, the speakers are very easy to muffle when placed on a table or when on your lap. Apart from the positioning, the speakers themselves aren’t of the highest quality, don’t get very loud, and can be difficult to hear in a room over any sort of ambient noise. Battery Samsung says that the battery of the Chromebook Pro will last up to 8 hours, but my experience has actually been better than that, ranging anywhere between 8 and 10 hours. The device certainly features enough battery life to comfortably last for a full work day for me. Of course, your mileage may vary. With the exception of editing photos or video, the Chromebook Pro was my primary work machine, with usage that involved responding to emails, communicating with my colleagues on Slack and writing notes or scripts on Google Docs, while also watching videos on YouTube and checking social media pages like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pretty regularly throughout the day. I only had to charge the Chromebook Pro once at night and it was always good to go for an entire day. That is certainly a huge shift from my experience with the Macbook Pro, which usually requires three or four charges every day, depending on what I’m doing. If your usage is even lighter than mine, you could easily push the battery of the Chromebook Pro into a few hours of the next day as well. Software Although the Chromebook Pro and Plus are the first Chromebooks to run Android applications out of the box, this is still a beta feature, which means that the experience isn’t flawless (yet). While social media apps like Facebook and Twitter do work as expected, the experience, especially when scrolling, can be quite choppy. There are quite a few apps and games in particular that fail to even load. The ones that do load don’t run very smoothly, which is more prominent when it comes to graphically-intensive games. Many apps also tend to have issues with properly rotating between the landscape and portrait orientations when trying to use the Chromebook as a tablet. Things will get better with time, but for now don’t expect perfection. Unlike with a phone or tablet, where an app typically takes up the entire screen, I do like the fact that a good majority of Android apps on ChromeOS can run in a minimized or smaller window, without losing out on the experience like you often do on split-screen mobile apps. This not only allows for easier multi-tasking between apps, but also allows the Chromebook to still feel like a regular computer instead of a tablet with a keyboard attached. Android apps on ChromeOS have a lot of promise and the extra functionality in terms of multimedia and productivity that is available by having full access to the Google Play Store is fantastic. However, until it’s out of beta and all the bugs have been ironed out, it is not going to be the showcase that Google and Samsung want it to be. Gallery Pricing and final thoughts The Chromebook Pro will be available later this year, but if you can’t wait for the Pro version, the Plus model can be picked up this month for the price of $449. While the pricing information of the Chromebook Pro isn’t known (although we did hear $549 at CES), it will naturally be more expensive than the Plus, putting them squarely in the upper tier of Chromebooks in terms of price. So there you have it for our in-depth review of the Samsung Chromebook Pro! While the price point is high for a Chromebook, it does have a lot to offer. You get the simplicity of ChromeOS but with an included stylus, a rotating touchscreen, and access to all of Google Play. The Chromebook Pro can be a simple machine when you want it to be, or become a more than capable multimedia and productivity workhorse, and that is the real beauty of this collaboration between Samsung and Google.

Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat Back in 2012, Google launched the first Chromebook laptop produced by Samsung. Five years later, the next-generation models have arrived, complete with modern-day features creators should find appealing and native Google Play app support. That’s right, you can run Android programs on a laptop now — or at least that’s Google’s intention. Samsung and Google introduced the Chromebook Plus and Pro to the world at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show. VentureBeat reviewed the latter device over the past two weeks, finding that the performance was exceptional and the Chromebook itself very useful for those who value productivity, high quality, and affordability. Another selling point was the Google Play store and the way apps would run on the Chromebook. Although this holds promise, initial reviews found downloaded apps to be buggy and not as responsive as hoped. Google acknowledged these issues and said that when the Google Play store exits beta at the end of April, the problems will be resolved.

Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat That said, both new Chromebooks are going on sale before then, with the Plus hitting store shelves on February 12 for $449 and the Pro available on March 1 for $549. Even though the Chromebook Pro is a great laptop, there are some things to consider in the short term. The power of the Chromebook Pixel, but cheaper “We worked for many years to bring the vision of a Chromebook to life,” explained Samsung product specialist Adam Coon. “We really wanted to drive home the innovation piece for Samsung and we wanted to deliver with the next generation of Chromebooks.” The Samsung Chromebook Pro is geared toward people who want to be productive both at their desk and on the go. Everything about it is intended to provide a “premium customer experience” — akin to Google’s Chromebook Pixel, which was discontinued last year — and to illustrate that you don’t have to spend thousands of dollars on a top-of-the-line laptop. A convertible laptop, the Chromebook Pro has a 12.3-inch 2400×1600 Quad HD touch panel display that rotates 360 degrees. The experience of watching movies, making video calls, or playing games on the device is pretty good. While our review unit has a silver metal magnesium alloy chassis, the final version will be in a black shade. Weighing 2.38 lbs, the Chromebook Plus and Pro are both among the lightest Chrome OS devices on the market. By comparison, the Chromebook Pixel 2 was 3.3 lbs, the HP Chromebook 13 weighs 2.86 lbs, the Haier Chromebook 11 is 2.54 lbs, the Hisense Chromebook is 3.3 lbs, the Dell Chromebook 13 comes in at 3 lbs, and the Acer C731 Chromebook weighs 2.98 lbs. Above: The Samsung Chromebook Pro Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat Samsung and Google have equipped the Chromebook Pro with an Intel Core m3 processor, while its sibling, the Chromebook Plus, comes with an OP1 hexa-core ARM processor, 4GB RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 39Wh battery Samsung says will last nearly eight hours. Fast charging is not available, and it took about an hour to fully charge an empty battery. Installed on the device are an accelerometer and a gyroscope, two sensors you’d normally find on mobile devices, along with a port for 1 microSD card, 2 USB-C ports, and a 720p high-definition camera. And yes, there is a headphone jack. The audio quality is satisfactory, but it could certainly be much better. There are times when I’ve watched YouTube videos at maximum volume and felt they should be even louder, which is a little surprising because the Chromebook Pro includes two tiny speakers on the bottom of the keyboard. It didn’t take long to get used to using the keyboard and trackpad, as the layout is similar to many other Chromebooks. This isn’t the first time Chromebooks have featured a touch screen — the Chromebook Pixel and Asus Chromebook Flip are just two other examples. However, the Samsung Chromebook Pro includes a stylus that lets you interact and draw on the screen as you would with pen and paper. The stylus mirrors that of the S-Pen on the Samsung Galaxy Note7, but it doesn’t include a button along the stem of the instrument. Coon said the stylus uses the same core technology as the smartphone pen. There’s also digitizer and palm rejection technology to reduce the chance of accidental drawings, smudges, or other activity if the screen is touched by a hand other than the one holding the stylus. Above: A look at the different parts of the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat What’s similar to the Note7 is that the Chromebook Pro includes a slot that stores the stylus when you’re not using it. After dislodging it from the compartment, the computer will automatically show a menu of stylus tools on the screen. You can capture a region or the screen, create a new note, and turn on the laser pointer mode or magnifying glass. In tablet mode, the stylus is useful as a mouse for drawing or web browsing, jotting down notes, or composing a document. “Writing on glass screens isn’t natural,” said Alex Kuscher, a senior product manager at Google. “We worked with Samsung to increase friction so it feels like writing on paper, more natural.” Indeed, using the stylus did feel like you were holding an actual pencil. When the Chromebook is in laptop mode, typing makes sense. But when in tablet mode, it might be faster to write out what you want. There is pressure sensitivity, so how hard you push against the screen can determine the brush or point weight. I tried using at least two other stylus-like instruments on the Chromebook screen, but those didn’t work. So if you lose the pen, you’ll have to purchase a replacement — how much that will be has yet to be released.

But at least with a microSD card slot, there’s room for expandable storage. After spending a few days with the Samsung Chromebook Pro, the appearance, specifications, and capabilities remind me of the Galaxy Note7 smartphone, in that it’s a powerful productivity device (sans exploding battery and mass recall). Chrome meets Android At first glance, you might wonder what really makes the Chromebook Plus and Pro stand out, as their noteworthy internal specifications aren’t exactly game-changers. A big selling point is that they’re built from the ground up to work with the Android apps that were announced at the 2016 Google I/O conference and began rolling out in September. Now, instead of needing duplicate apps, you can run the same apps on your mobile device as on a Chromebook. Above: Onboarding screen when you first use the Google Play store on the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Screenshot Some laptops have been able to run a beta version of the Google Play store, and our review unit was no different. As I tried out Android apps on the Chromebook, there were some serious bugs, such as an unresponsive app, being unable to enter in text or apply any input, and random crashes. Again, all these incidents were reported to Google, which promises they will all be eliminated by late April, when the Google Play store publicly launches. The organization could use some work, though, because both Chrome and Android apps are merged into a single section on the Chromebook, which can make things a bit more complicated when you have two of the same apps, such as Google Docs. This is similar to the experience VentureBeat’s Jordan Novet had with the Asus Chromebook Flip. Right now, the only way to immediately distinguish which one is Chrome-based is by looking to see if the app icon has a small Chrome logo in the lower right-hand side. Grouping is supported, so if things get too cluttered you can piece apps together by category. Above: Screenshot of the Google Play store on the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Screenshot Because the display is larger than a smartphone, Android apps on the Chromebook are window-sized by default. They can be resized to maximize the screen real estate, but not all apps will necessarily work when resized. Google Assistant is not supported on either Samsung Chromebook. App performance Unfortunately, some programs couldn’t be downloaded through the Play Store, including Periscope, WhatsApp, Uber Eats, Samsung Pay, and Android Pay (it can be installed but cards cannot be added). Below are some of the apps that I tested and my experience with them. Uber The app works as intended, but there are some glitches with its appearance, depending on how you’re using the computer. When the Chromebook is in laptop mode, the app will take up the entire screen; if it’s minimized and revisited, it will appear as a window tile. But when you convert the device to a tablet, Uber maximizes to fill the entire screen and is optimized for portrait mode. What makes this app compelling is that you don’t have to switch between computer and phone to request a pickup. Instagram Above: Instagram as seen on the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Screenshot Facebook brings all the features you’re used to on Instagram to the Chromebook. You can browse through your feed and Instagram Stories using the stylus, by touch, or using the trackpad, though the first two methods make using the app significantly easier. You can also explore, view notifications, and check out your profile. And if you’re so inclined, you can post photos to Instagram using images you’ve stored locally on the Chromebook Pro or take a selfie, which is basically what you’re limited to because the computer doesn’t have a rear-facing camera. Slack Slack is available on many operating systems, including the web, iOS, and Android, and as a desktop app. However, for Chrome OS, you’d have to use the web interface, since a native version hasn’t been released yet. But now that the Chromebook Pro supports the Android app, it’s more seamless. When I tried Slack on the computer it didn’t show up as a vertical tile, like a standard app, instead it appeared more like the desktop version. Snapchat Above: Logging into Snapchat resulted in an error on the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Screenshot With a high-definition camera at your disposal, why not take advantage of Snapchat? Unfortunately, when testing out the app on the Chromebook Pro, I couldn’t even log in — every time I tried, I received an error saying the “login temporarily failed, so please try again later.” It didn’t appear to be a user error, because I was able to successfully log into my account on my iPhone. Quip Quip was one of the apps that I had some difficulty using. It looked like it would function as it normally does, but then I would suddenly be unable to select where the cursor should go or even type anything into my documents. The only way to remedy this was to restart the app. But aside from this glaring bug, which may be attributed to the Google Play store being in beta, Quip operates just like it would on an Android device. Facebook Above: How the Android app version of Facebook looks when in tile form on the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Screenshot Facebook’s app provided a less-than-stellar experience, at least visually. When used, it appears full-screen, with just the News Feed (and sans any advertising and other modules that would normally appear in the right-hand sidebar). But when you reduce the size of the app, everything gets horribly compressed, and it becomes difficult to use. However, because it’s an Android app, if you convert the Chromebook Plus into tablet mode, it becomes tolerable. Overall, I felt using Facebook on the web provides a better experience than going through the Android app on Chromebook. Asphalt 8 Gaming is one category where having a tablet comes in handy. Because the Chromebook Pro has an accelerometer and gyroscope, there’s now a bigger screen that you can be entertained on. Asphalt 8 is a car racing game, and while the graphics are beautiful on the screen, it can be a bit unwieldy. And gripping on a large screen can be a bit of a hassle. Every now and then, I found myself accidentally pressing the task window bar in the Chrome OS menu bar with the palm of my hand. To solve this, I hid the menu bar, but it would be great if developers prevented this from showing up as you use the app. Asphalt 8 also had some bugs in it, specifically some latency in responsiveness after tapping a button when in game mode. Like with Quip, I had to restart the app to get it working again. One feature that I was surprised to find missing was the game launcher mode that has become a staple of the Samsung Galaxy smartphone series. Since you’re playing Android-based games, it’s strange that Samsung didn’t include its power save mode, allow you to hide alerts, take screenshots, or record your gameplay to share on YouTube or Facebook later on. Adobe Lightroom Above: Adobe Lightroom on Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Screenshot After Samsung announced that the Chromebook Plus and Pro would support Android apps, Adobe revealed that its Creative Cloud apps would be available on Chromebooks. I installed Adobe Lightroom and was happy with the experience. Unlike other programs, there were no glitches when editing photos. You can add photos from an attached camera, local storage, or from a microSD card. And there are a variety of ways to interact with Lightroom, either by touch — like you would on an Android device — or using the track pad or the stylus. Netflix The Chromebook Pro is intended for media consumption, so I looked at how Netflix would perform. The quality of the images is really good and so is the audio quality. Any latency issues were not apparent. Videos will play in landscape mode, even when in tablet mode. Plants vs. Zombies Heroes If you’re a fan of the Plants vs. Zombies game, you’ll be happy to know that you won’t have to play them through a Chrome extension on the Chromebook Pro. You can play Plants vs. Zombies in either laptop or tablet mode, but it’s optimized for the latter. Game play felt like you were on a smartphone or Android tablet instead of a computer. Art Canvas Above: Using the stylus in the ArtCanvas app on the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat An obvious use case for the stylus is drawing, and Art Canvas is just one of the Android apps you can illustrate on. As mentioned earlier, the instrument offers pressure sensitivity, so the harder you press on the screen, the heavier the brush. And with palm rejection, you won’t have to worry about smudging your work by resting your hand on the screen. Google Hangouts Google Hangouts works fine on the Chromebook Pro — you can send messages and make video calls. Having a 720p high-definition webcam provides good video quality for chats you might have with family, friends, coworkers, and clients. GBoard and third-party keyboards While you’re able to select different keyboards within Chrome, Google doesn’t allow you to install and use third-party apps, and shockingly this includes GBoard, which had an Android app as of last December. But even though alternate keyboards aren’t currently supported, there are plans to do so in the future, according to a Google spokesperson. Buy or pass? After my test, I’m going to have to say that the Samsung Chromebook Pro is a good laptop to have, especially for those who want powerful performance while on the go and the support of Android apps. There are a few issues that may dissuade people, but they’re related to the Google Play store, and since it’s still in beta, it’s somewhat understandable. However, not having these things smoothed out before the new Chromebooks go on sale is a bummer. The bugs referenced previously are not necessarily deal breakers, as the benefits the Samsung Chromebook Pro offers outweigh the issues that Google already said it’s fixing, and which will likely result in additional updates from developers. When traveling, I often take my MacBook Air, my phone, and my Nexus 7 tablet, each serving different purposes. The laptop is so I can continue working remotely while browsing the web and storing photos and files on a hard drive — we all know there are occasions when a laptop is called for. The tablet is so I can catch up on reading while watching movies and engaging in entertainment without sacrificing the battery on my phone. And, of course, the phone is for all my other activities — such as posting on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter, and listening to music. Above: VentureBeat’s Ken Yeung uses the Samsung Chromebook Pro in tablet mode. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat But now that I have the Chromebook Pro, I can leave the tablet behind. The form factor of a convertible laptop is sufficient for all my needs, and it’s likely that additional Android app-supported Chromebooks will enter the market soon. In order to ensure maximum user satisfaction, it would behoove Google and manufacturers like Samsung to allow developers to optimize their apps around these laptops and to take advantage of functionality such as the stylus. There is a lot of potential in this stylish and premium Chromebook. It may well give the iPad Pro and Microsoft Surface Book some competition, and you won’t have to break the bank to get it.

Nick Thomas Centre Daily Times, file i By Claire Meler LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Editor’s note: The Focus on Research column highlights different research projects and topics being explored at Penn State. With the introduction of location-based games such as Ingress or, more recently, Pokemon Go, an influx of gamers equipped with mobile devices appeared around the country. While the primary focus of players is catching Pokemon or capturing portals, new research conducted by Anthony Buccitelli, professor of American studies and communications at Penn State Harrisburg, suggests that gamers are doing more than just playing — they’re building communities and connecting with their local cultural heritage. Buccitelli recently presented his research on locative gaming and cultural heritage as part of a faculty colloquium series hosted by the School of Humanities. The presentation, titled “Ingress, Folk Geographies and the Experience of Cultural Heritage,” discussed the cultural and historical benefits of locative games with a particular focus on Google’s Ingress, an augmented-reality game for mobile phones. Ingress was created by Niantic Labs, formerly a Google subsidiary and the same company responsible for developing the recently popular augmented-reality game Pokemon Go. Ingress players select one of two possible factions to represent, capturing portals represented by geographical features and defending them from the opposing faction. The portals are located in both urban and rural areas, but concentrated around population centers, and many are player-generated, Buccitelli said. An annotative feature of Ingress allows players to submit significant locations for review to create additional portals, and an option to add photographs and small write-ups is also available. These features, Buccitelli said, are key for understanding the impact of location-based games on players’ surroundings. “I would argue that it is important to understand these games because they shape the way we perceive what counts as important heritage locations and what does not,” he added. “For example, since part of my study was based on work in my hometown in Massachusetts, I was particularly struck by the way in which the geography of Ingress failed to match what I understood to be important sites in the cultural and historical life of our community.” Instead, the portals that did exist reflected the way in which Niantic Labs conceived of what counted as heritage locations, Buccitelli said, a definition that was influenced by legal and commercial concerns rather than an understanding of local cultures. The criteria for acceptance requires portals to have cultural or historical significance, inadvertently forcing players to acknowledge their local heritage, he said. Sites with historical markers or “cool” art and culture are generally accepted, for instance, as well as sites that serve as public gathering places. At Penn State Harrisburg alone, 19 Ingress portals exist. Local Ingress players are constantly battling to claim each portal for their respective factions. “The Class of 1999 bench is particularly vulnerable,” Buccitelli joked. Though the game’s tagline is “The world around you is not what it seems,” Ingress enables players to learn about their communities and establish meaningful relationships with the physical landscape that perhaps would not otherwise exist. And in some instances, location-based games can be used to intentionally draw members of the community to specific locations. Emily Mross, business and public administration liaison librarian at Penn State Harrisburg, took advantage of the “Pokestops” located around the campus’ library, hanging up signs that encouraged players to stop by. Harrisburg Area Community College hosted a Pokemon Go event on its campus, Mross said, where hundreds of individuals, community members and students alike, showed up to catch Pokemon at the various gyms and Pokestops. Mross is considering hosting a similar event at Penn State Harrisburg where players can connect with one another while also learning about campus offerings. The future of locative gaming, according to Buccitelli, seems to be heading toward a more normalized experience. “I see locative technologies more generally as part of a cluster of technologies that are very soon going to converge into a much different everyday experience of technology,” he said. “The combination of location-based technologies like augmented or virtual reality and the networking of everyday objects is going to much more closely tie our everyday lives to digital spaces.” Claire Meler is a Penn State Harrisburg student and communications intern.

Users stream millions of songs, upload their own collections and much more. It has a lot to offer, but it’s not perfect. Here we’ll discuss some common Google Play Music problems and some potential fixes for users. Advertisement It has over 35 million songs, our own library of tracks, and even a monthly subscription service. Giving users access to music anywhere, YouTube Red with ad-free videos and more. It’s certainly worth checking out. A service that’s great when it works, but frustrating when there are issues. Read: Play Music Family Plans: What to Know I have over 8,000 songs uploaded to Google Music, completely free, and it can hold a lot more. It’s one of the best services around. But as we said above, it’s not without its own share of issues. Just like most apps around. Whether music won’t upload, songs aren’t playing or you have duplicate tracks, we’re here to help. Looking through Google’s product help forums we see complaints about music not playing, or the Music Manager having problems of its own. A good place to start for any issue is Google’s help forum, and here’s a list of problem-solving tips for the Music Manager app itself. Advertisement To help you all out, we’ve round up some of the most common Google Music problems and any potential fixes, workarounds, or other ideas. Lets get started. Google Music Isn’t Working So, your music isn’t playing or the app isn’t working. We’ve all been there, seeing nothing but a swirling circle trying to load a song forever. However, it never starts playing. The first thing that comes to mind is your data connection. Make sure you have a solid connection or are signed into a WiFi network for the best experience. Another idea is heading to settings and changing the quality over mobile streaming, as sometimes our phones can’t get enough 4G LTE to start streaming music. Occasionally you’ll see full bars, but it still won’t play. It’s always a good idea to toggle on and off your internet or WiFi connection, or even restart your device. I try closing and re-opening Google Music first, which usually fixes any odd issues. Advertisement However, there are other potential reasons. Is someone else streaming music on the account? By default only one device can stream music at a time. So if it’s paused on your laptop somewhere, your phone or tablet may not start streaming. Usually it just kicks the other device off, but that doesn’t always work as intended. Google allows up to 10 devices to be connected to any one account, and you can always go in and de-authorize access to music, if it fills it. Keep that in mind if you’ve tried using Google Music on a lot of devices. Oddly enough, the biggest problem we see is with people that have more than one Google Account. Hit the dropdown bar on the left side, and make sure you’re signed into the right account. Once done, music should start playing. Duplicate Tracks A problem I’m all too familiar with, is duplicate tracks. Between adding my collection from a MacBook, Windows PC, downloads and transferring iTunes, I have tons of duplicates. I had the program sort music by song in alphabetical order, and one-by-one deleted doubles. It took forever. Sadly Google doesn’t have a solution to this yet. We expect one will arrive at some point, but for now, we’re out of luck. I’d suggest deleting the entire library on Google Music and re-uploading it from the original source. Just make sure your computer or iTunes doesn’t have doubles, and you’ll be fine. Last but not least, one Reddit user created a solution, but it takes some technical know-how. So use caution, and give this link a try. Advertisement Missing Tracks Are you missing tracks in Google Music? Some might be on your music player but missing on the phone. This usually is just a glitch with the sync service, and a refresh will fix it. Open Google Music and tap the 3-lines at the top left. This slides out a menu, in which you’ll navigate to Settings. Select settings and right near the top under account is some information about subscriptions, then a big “Refresh” button. Tap this, and sync will reinitiate. This will also fix any payment problems for those trying to stream music. Songs Won’t Upload Another thing we get asked about often is songs not uploading through the Google Music Manager. This can typically be broken down to one of three problems. Advertisement Library is Full (Music Supports up to 50,000 songs) File Format Not Supported Music Bought on Another Account When people have problems uploading music it’s typically one of the above problems. Well, unless you’re on a PC and it’s trying to upload from iTunes but doesn’t have the right target to draw music from. Google Music allows up to 50,000 songs, but we doubt very many users are over that limit. Which brings us to the biggest problem. Format. Make sure music is in a format like MP3, AAC, WMA, OGG, FLAC and others. Google Music doesn’t support windows WAV files, AIFF or RI file types. They are rare, but it happens. Last but not least make sure you’re trying to upload music on and from the same account it was purchased. Those with family sharing or other accounts often accidentally run into this. Censored Music This isn’t too big of a problem anymore, but we still see complaints about it. Say you uploaded 5,000 songs from your computer to Google Music Manager, but playing them on your phone they are censored. No one wants that. Inside Google Music go to Settings > Scroll down to block Explicit songs in radio and make sure it’s unchecked. Once you do this, try hitting Refresh again. During the upload Google matches many of the songs and adds them to your account, rather than copying the exact file. Sometimes you’ll get censored versions. Unchecking this before you start uploading will ensure no songs are censored. This will also prevent the streaming service from blocking explicit songs while you are listening to tunes and beats. Too Many Devices We briefly mentioned this earlier, but it’s something many run into. Having too many devices connected to Google Music, and it won’t let you add more. Google reportedly did away with the “limit” a few years back, but I still have the problem myself. By default it allows five smartphones to have access to Google Play Music, and 10 devices overall. This is for security, and piracy, among other things. For whatever reason if you’ve hit the limit, simply go into settings and find the option labeled “Manage your devices”. This will show every device connected to Google Music. If there are old smartphones, tablets, or devices no longer being used simply hit the X and remove them. It’s that easy. Right inside settings. In the past we were unable to do this on the actual device, but now it takes less than 15 seconds to de-authorize devices and get back to enjoying music. Payment Issues Last but not least are payment issues. Those who had a free trial or recently signed up for Google Music All Access or a family plan, could face this. I pay a monthly fee to enjoy all Google Play Music has to offer, and many others do too. If a payment is declined, cannot be processed, or a card is “not eligible” you may need to fix something. Most of the time it simply has an outdated card on file for the Google account in terms of payments. This is an easy fix. Subscribing to Google Pay Music is $9.99 a month and everything goes through the Google Play Store. Meaning simply make sure the credit card or PayPal account on file is accurate, then retry in music. Read: How To Add or Edit a Debit Card on the Google Play Store Alternatively, sometimes a payment just doesn’t go through. Try it one more time, or restart the application and hit subscribe once more. If all else fails you may need to reboot your device or contact your bank. Most of the time everything works fine, as long as the payment source in the Play Store is up to date. Everything above aside, Google Play Music remains one of the best options in the mobile market. We have access to millions of songs, our own music, personalized radio stations and more. Give our suggestions above a try, and enjoy the app. If you have any other problems, drop us a comment below and we’ll try to help.

It’s now back up for purchase. There are a few catches, though: those wanting the 32GB Really Blue model are still out of luck, and if you opt for the 128GB model then your choice is confined to Quite Black. There’s also the matter that Google is still showing a 4-5 week wait on shipment, so you’re still in for a rough wait if you have your heart set on it. We’re not sure why Google is having a tough time keeping stock replenished. Our best guess was that Verizon and Best Buy are eating most of the inventory up, but they’re having issues, too. In any case, if you don’t mind the wait and can’t settle for the smaller brother, at least you can get your order in to secure a shipment to celebrate the beginning of a new Spring.

The free training session was designed to help participants understand how they can grow their charity online with top tips for making the most of the web for their organisations and a session on how to use social media and free online tools. Among those attending were Heather Simpson from Homestart in Dungannon and Bernie Mullan from First Steps Women’s Centre in Dungannon. The day was hosted by Halifax and the Halifax foundation for Northern Ireland and delivered in collaboration with Google and Reason Digital, a specialist agency that works with voluntary organisations, community groups and other pro-social organisations to change the world using digital technology. Brenda McMullan, Halifax Foundation for Northern Ireland said: “Digital skills and a strong online presence are more important than ever and to thrive charities need the skills to communicate effectively through social media and through their websites. Having moved to an online application system within the Halifax Foundation for Northern Ireland, we are committed to supporting charities to access our funding and what better way to do this than by utilising the expertise of Google, Reason Digital and Lloyds Banking Group. Many of the organisations that we support have said they would like to make better use of their online communications and we feel these digital skills will give charities in Northern Ireland the tools they need to really make the most of the web.” Google’s Digital Garages focus on assisting those looking for a ‘digital tune-up’ to learn the skills they need to make the most of the web. They look to equip participants with the knowledge they need to ‘turbocharge’ growth, with the workshops acting as a one stop shop. The workshop was followed by a networking event where attendees were able to discuss what they’ve learnt with their peers as well as representatives from Lloyds Banking Group, Google, and Reason Digital. Financial and digital inclusion is a priority for Lloyds Banking Group and is included in the Group’s Helping Britain Prosper Plan. The workshop in Belfast is part of a wider approach to deliver digital skills training to small organisations across the UK. Jim McCooe, Lloyds Banking Group’s Ambassador for Northern Ireland said: “Boosting the digital skills of charities in Northern Ireland gives them the opportunity to make the most of the amazing talent and ability that they already have. Research highlights that 49% of charities lack digital skills and it is for this reason that the Group has made a public commitment within its Helping Britain Prosper Plan to ensure that 20,000 of its colleagues provide support to people and organisations use the internet to improve digital skills and financial capabilities by 2020. It’s also fantastic that the work undertaken by the Halifax Foundation for Northern Ireland, through our collaboration with Google, allows us to support our communities across Northern Ireland in this way.” If you have any queries, please contact Matthew.Good@Lloydsbanking.com Trending Tyrone primary principal raises lid on ‘highly inappropriate and destructive’ bullying on social media Police ‘increasingly concerned’ for missing man Co Tyrone mum sleeping rough in LA to pay for son’s medical bills Support for biker fighting for his life Thief stole £1000 from Cookstown Chinese restaurant Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

Before the Nougat software update becomes relatively outdated however, Google is doing its best to widen Nougat’s reach among Android devices. This Friday, many consumers will finally get the chance to upgrade the OS of their devices because the Mountain View giant is rolling out Android N to a range of gadgets.  First on the list is Nvidia’s Shield tablet. The 2-year-old device is getting the Android 7.0 Nougat treatment via the Shield Experience 5.0 update. According to Android Police, the software update brings Android 7.0 features to the tablet. These features include multi-window or split-screen support, bundled notifications, the quick reply-to-message option, Unicode 9 emojis, Doze on the Go, Quick Settings customizations and many other improvements.  In addition, Shield Experience 5.0 comes with the Android Security Patch Level that’s dated Dec. 1, 2016. The new JIT compiler is also present to improve the speed of App & System updates. There is also the new data saver implementation that basically limits access to Cellular data for background apps. Another important upgrade for the tablet is the support for the new SHIELD Controller that ships with the 2017 Shield TV boxes.  Related Stories Closed Door Launch For Samsung's Foldable Smartphones At MWC 2017 Android Wear 2.0 Brings In New Features Android Wear 2.0 Smartwatches Will Support NFC-Based Payments Android Nougat is rolling out to the Honor 8 smartphone as well.

For the Chinese smartphone, the Nougat update comes with EMUI 5.0, which is the latest version of Huawei’s Skin for Android. The features that are part of this software update include multi-window, “eye comfort” mode, customization options for notifications and status bar as well as the return of the app drawer to the home screen.  Many Sony Xperia fans can also rejoice this Friday because Android 7.0 is coming to their gadgets. The Verge has learned that Sony is rolling out the Nougat update to its Xperia Z3+ and Xperia Z5 series smartphones and even to its Xperia Z4 tablet. As stated on the Xperia blog, the new firmware will not only bring Nougat features, but also some fixes for bugs found in the previous release.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

The court said Google has every right to do so for several reasons including the first amendment. Here is the snippet from the judgment: First, as Google argues, the removal of e-ventures’ websites from Google’s search engines is not a false statement and is thus protected First Amendment speech. There is no dispute that Google made no public announcement regarding the removal of e-ventures’ websites or the reasons behind the removal. But even if Google had published a press release that e-venutures’ [sic] websites were violating Google’s guidelines, that publication would be protected because the statement is true. e-ventures’ websites were in violation of Google’s Guidelines, and thus the removal of those websites was true speech, if it was speech at all. But there is a more fundamental reason why the First Amendment bars e-ventures’ claims. Google’s actions in formulating rankings for its search engine and in determining whether certain websites are contrary to Google’s guidelines and thereby subject to removal are the same as decisions by a newspaper editor regarding which content to publish, which article belongs on the front page, and which article is unworthy of publication. The First Amendment protects these decisions, whether they are fair or unfair, or motivated by profit or altruism. Here is the full document as a PDF. Eric Goldman said "of course Google can de-index sites it thinks are spam. It’s hard to believe we’re still litigating that issue in 2017." Matt Cutts, former Googler, wrote on Twitter: In my time at Google, we got to see so many interesting legal and policy situations. Glad to see another First Amendment win for web search. https://t.co/F32gddbKby— Matt Cutts (@mattcutts) February 10, 2017 So save your money and don't sue Google over getting a penalty.

Home > Google News > Google Tests Method To Report Autocomplete Suggestions Google Tests Method To Report Autocomplete Suggestions Feb 10, 2017 • 7:41 am | (0) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Google has said they are testing a way to report offensive autocomplete suggestions. You know, the search suggestions Google gives searches as they type their query. Here is a screen shot Google sent us of the method they are deploying. You can see the autocompletes and on the bottom right, there is a "report offensive query." Google told Search Engine Land: Autocomplete predictions are based on searches previously carried out by users around the world. That means that predicted terms are sometimes unexpected or offensive. We have been actively working on improvements to our algorithm that will help surface more high quality, credible content on the web. In addition, we’re experimenting with a new feature that allows people to report offensive Search predictions. We’re working to incorporate such feedback into our algorithms, and we hope to roll this out more broadly over time. Autocomplete isn’t an exact science and we’re continually working to improve it. We've covered numerous cases of autocomplete in Google offending religions, races, politics and much more. So I wonder how Google will deal with all the complaints here? Forum discussion at Twitter.

He said, "DYK that after 18 years we're still using PageRank (and 100s of other signals) in ranking?" Here is the tweet: DYK that after 18 years we're still using PageRank (and 100s of other signals) in ranking?

But that does not mean Google doesn't use PageRank internally - they said they do and Gary repeated it today. How should this impact you and your SEO? Well, it really shouldn't.

The email sent by Google specifically asks devs to resolve the issue latest by March 15. In the case of non-compliance, Google will limit visibility of such apps and might even remove them from the Play Store. What exactly is Google’s User Data policy? The User Data policy asks app developers to be transparent when handling information acquired about users through their apps. Permissions such as access to the microphone, camera, contacts, messaging among others are very sensitive in nature. The developer needs to specify where and for what purposes this data is being used. Also Read: Why Progressive Web Apps could be a threat to mobile apps Steps developers need to follow To resolve the issue, devs need to include a privacy policy link on their app store pages as well as in apps. Alternatively, Google suggests that developers revoke the permission to request users their data if they cannot provide the privacy policy. Google’s move is commendable considering the Play Store is full of apps that abuse the platform and make it more crowded. The purging of such applications will mean that genuine apps become more discoverable in the marketplace. On users part, apps which use their sensitive information without consent will be done away with.

The latest Chrome OS build, which brings along material design, bug fixes, and feature enhancements, will be rolled out to the devices in [the next "several" days. The Chrome OS version 56.0.2924.87 update brings along Material Design to the Chrome OS shelf as well as system menu. The shelf switches from a bar shape to a circle to note when a window or app is open, 9to5Google pointed out in its report. Further, there are animations that confirm every icon click, tap on the app drawer, notifications, and status tray results, as per the report. Apart from the Material Design, Google has added a flash component updater and made the new version of the ChromeVox screen reader default across all Chromebooks. ChromeVox screen reader essentially helps the visually impaired users in using the platform with audio prompts and keyboard. Other features that come with the update include the switch to HTML5 as default and the "not secure" label for HTTP websites. Further, the Web Bluetooth API allows Web apps to connect with the Bluetooth low energy devices. Recently, several leaks suggested that Microsoft is coming up with a simplified version of Windows 10, called Windows 10 Cloud, in order to fight the rising competition from Chromebooks.

As cocks crow in the background, 17-year-old Nji Collins Gbah tells the BBC about the series of complex technical tasks he completed for Google between November and mid-January. Nji had thrown himself into the contest, using knowledge gained from two years of learning how to code, mainly from online sources and books, as well as other skills he was picking up on the fly. The prestigious Google Code-in is open to pre-university students worldwide between the ages of 13 and 17. This year more than 1,300 young people from 62 countries took part. By the time entries closed, Nji had completed 20 tasks, covering all five categories set by Google. One task alone took a whole week to finish. And then just a day after the deadline for final submissions, the internet went dead. Nji lives in Bamenda in Cameroon´s North-West, a journey of about seven hours by road from the capital (according to Google). It is an English-speaking region where there are long-held grievances about discrimination and what people see as the Francophone establishment´s failure to respect the status of English as an official language of Cameroon. In recent months, disgruntlement has escalated into street protests and strikes by lawyers and teachers. North-West and South-West are Cameroon´s two English-speaking regions The authorities have responded with scores of arrests and a text-message campaign warning people of long jail terms for "spreading false news" or "malicious use of social media". Cutting off the internet, an act still unacknowledged by the government, is seen by rights activists as both punishment and a blunt tool for holding back dissent. Why has Cameroon blocked the internet? For an ambitious, tech-savvy though outwardly unpolitical teenager like Nji, whose school was already closed because of the protests, living without the internet was unthinkable. As it was becoming clear that the outage was more than temporary, Nji received some unexpected news - he had been chosen as one of Google´s 34 grand prize winners. "I was really, really amazed," he says. "It meant my hard work writing a lot of code had really paid off." But a champion coder without the internet will not stay on top of his game for long. Hence the trip to Yaounde. "I wanted to get a connection so I could continue studying and keep in touch with Google," says Nji. In due course, he hopes to finish school back in Bamenda, and then study computer science at a good university. As part of his prize from Google, Nji will spend four days in June at the tech giant´s Silicon Valley headquarters, meeting its top engineers and gaining insight into one of the world´s most successful enterprises. "Hopefully I would like to work there one day, if that is possible," he says. At the moment, Nji says he is hard at work building his knowledge of artificial intelligence, neural networks and deep learning. "I´m trying to develop my own model for data compression, using deep learning and machine learning," he says. His eventual goal is a "huge step" forward in capabilities for data transfer and storage. Google HQ in Mountain View, CaliforniaImage copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption Nji is looking forward to visiting Google´s Silicon Valley HQ in the summer, as part of his prize In a few days, Nji will turn 18, having already won international recognition for his achievements. He admits to having gone back through previous years´ Code-in prize announcements to double-check he was the first African winner. When I ask, he says he has received congratulations from "a lot of friends and family and some people I don´t really know". Has anyone from the government been in touch? "No, no-one," he says. Back in Bamenda, a city of 500,000 and home to one of the continent´s brightest young technologists, they wonder when the government will plug the internet back in.

Snapchat's parent company last week filed for an IPO, revealing in that document that it is paying $2 billion to use Google Cloud over the next five years ($400 million a year), becoming one of Google's biggest cloud customers. But in an update to that filing yesterday, Snap revealed it is also spending $1 billion on Amazon Web Services (AWS) over the next five years. That starts with a $50 million spend this year, $125 million next year, $200 million in 2019, $275 million in 2020, then $350 million in 2021. "If we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitment during any year, we are required to pay the difference," the filing admitted. Snap is paying for Google's compute and storage to host its services, and to use Google's bandwidth, with Snapchat now counting 158 million daily users. Its deal with AWS is for "redundant infrastructure support of our business operations" — so, backup in case its primary services fail. It's been using AWS since March 2016, committing to the $1 billion spend in February this year. "In the future, we may invest in building our own infrastructure to better serve our customers," the filing added. 03/02/2017: Snap to invest $2 billion in Google Cloud Snap has committed to purchasing $2 billion in Google cloud services over the next five years, according to the company's S-1 filing. The Snapchat parent company will pay $400 million each year for five years, in a licensing platform agreement that will make the company one of Google's largest cloud customers. According to the deal, for the first four years Snap will be able to roll over 15% of each payment to a subsequent year, providing the company continues to meet a minimum purchase commitment. By 2022, Snap will have invested $2 billion into its Google cloud services. The investment was announced alongside the company's long-awaited IPO filing set at $3 billion, although this is a placeholder amount and likely to change. Snap revealed that its social media app Snapchat now has 158 million daily users, although losses for the company rose in 2016 to $514 million, up from $373 million in the previous year. Snap's partnership with Google first began in 2013, and since then the company has been able to scale quickly without the need for upfront infrastructure costs. However the Los Angeles-based company now heavily relies on the service to operate effectively and has acknowledged the potential risks associated with the deal. "We rely on Google Cloud to host the vast majority of our computing, storage, bandwidth and other services. Any disruption of, or interference with our use of the Google Cloud operation would negatively affect our operations and seriously harm our business," stated Snap in its IPO filing. The filing also made investors aware that reliance on Google Cloud may stifle its ability to grow into restrictive markets. "We also face regulatory challenges that may affect our ability to grow in certain markets. We have very limited access to the China market, as we have not yet established an operating presence in China to support Snapchat. Access to Google, which currently powers our infrastructure, is restricted in China." Read more about: Private Cloud Cloud Management Google View the discussion thread.

Unfortunately, the 'Home Control' feature on Pixel phones isn't available to all users and is likely to be limited as of now. A Reddit thread points that the 'Home Control' feature was visible on the Google Pixel which was running Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta version with the Google app version 6.12.19 and Play Services 10.2.98. We can expect the added feature to be made to all users in the coming days or weeks. With the addition, Google Pixel (and Pixel XL) users will see a new Home Control section showing up within the Assistant settings page. To set up Home Control on Google Assistant, go to the Assistant settings on Pixel phone, and then select Home Control, and click + to add a new device. Users can add devices such as Nest, Hue, Honeywell, WeMo, and SmartThings among others, or even assign a device to each room, similar to how the devices are added in Google Home. A screenshot shared by Android Police shows the new Home Control settings page. One of the biggest advantages of the new control smart home devices with Assistant is it doesn't require Google Home. With smart device control support on your Pixel, you can conveniently manage home's lights without leaving the comfort of your bed by just saying "Ok Google, turn the lights on." With Home Control on your Pixel, it will help you remember if you left lights on in your bedroom and can turn it off via phone by just saying, "Ok Google, turn off lights in my bedroom." The new feature could come handy for those users who do not own Google Home, a voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant for home automation, and can get things done just with the help of Google Assistant on the Pixel. Last month, Google Home added support for Belkin Wemo and Honeywell products.

It suggests that UK retailers are behind in moving to put mobile first, and that before long the emphasis may well be on mobile only. The Mobile Mandate report, from OC&C Strategy Consultants, Google and PayPal, argues that by 2020 80% of all online retail will involve a smartphone at some stage. Nonetheless, it says, UK retailers are behind their international competitors in the US and in Asia in being prepared for this shift. Currently, says the report, £13.5bn is spent via mobile. The report is based on an exclusive dataset of search and transaction data from Google and PayPal UK, with analysis by and additional research from OC&C. Consumer research, undertaken as part of the report, found speed was the most important factor when shopping online, but on average, leading UK retailer sites are between 10% and 25% slower to load on smartphone than their US counterparts. Google research shows that improving load times by one second can increase conversion rates by 27%. The consumer research found that half of Britons (48%) would prefer customer support via mobile chat, but only 16% of the top 100 UK retailers offered this service. More than twice as many of the top 100 US retailers do so (41%). More people use messaging apps each month (3bn+ active users) than social networking sites (2.5bn active users), but few top UK retailers have a presence on a messaging platform. Meanwhile, in China, about 250m consumers bought via WeChat in 2016. Alex Mathers, associate partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants, said: “Smartphone shopping is taking over online retail, bringing with it fundamental changes in how, when and where people shop. Brits are shopping more whilst out and about, they’re using mobile to research and compare prices for later purchases, and they’re spending more on mobile while in-store – very often with other retailers. There’s money to be made by tapping into these changing behaviours, but on the flip side, retailers that fail to adapt will find themselves haemorrhaging customers. Right now, the average UK retailer’s strategy should be mobile first – in a few years, it may well be mobile only.” The report argues that the move to mobile commerce comes as shoppers radically change their buying habits, spending about £1.5bn over mobile phones in 2016 whilst out and about – travelling, commuting and in cafes. A further £1.25bn was spent, it says, while in store – around £500m of that total with a different retailer. More than one third (39%) of consumers trust information they find online more than store assistants. Mathers says that high impact steps, such as developing a presence on messaging platforms, and using mobile to connect online and wi-fi connected stores, are key. “Finally, and most importantly, make speed king,” he said. “Improve load times, but also help consumers complete their mission as quickly as possible – streamline the journey, and help users work cross-device via things like basket sharing, wish-lists and sharing recently viewed items across devices.” Rob Harper, mobile commerce director at PayPal UK [IRDX VPAY], said: “Speed is an important factor in any shopping experience, but when it comes to mobile shopping it’s vital. Retailers can reduce the time it takes to browse and select a purchase but if it takes too long to pay, they may lose that sale.” Martijn Bertisen, sales director at Google UK [IRDX VGOO], said: “Mobile technology continues to be one of the key drivers in transforming the retail industry and consumer shopping experience. Consumers are increasingly relying on their smartphones for information around shopping and locations in moments that matter: the ‘I want to know…’, ‘I want to go…’ or ‘I want to buy…’ moments. With a plethora of searches, each showing an intent or a behaviour, there is a great opportunity for retailers to offer useful products and information, just when shoppers are looking for it. As consumers become accustomed to this way of shopping, retailers need to respond by providing a swift and seamless online service – and the best way to do this is by putting mobile at the heart of their marketing, loyalty and e-commerce strategy.” Looking to the future, Harper said mobile shopping was set to change still further. “The next evolution of mobile shopping will reduce the consumer journey even further,” he said. “Contextual commerce will enable consumers to buy things at the point of discovery – whether that’s in an email, on a Pinterest page or in a messenger app – rather than needing to click through to an online shop. Mobile technology is determining the future of e-commerce, and retailers need to act now to prepare themselves accordingly.” Mentioned in this piece… PayPal IRDX: VPAY Google IRDX: VGOO Google is an American multinational corporation specialising in Internet-related services and products.

Google-owned DeepMind is using artificial intelligence to study how cooperation and conflict emerge. By Liam Tung | February 10, 2017 -- 12:13 GMT (04:13 PST) | Topic: Artificial Intelligence In this game two agents, a red and a blue dot, have to gather green-dot apples. Image: Google DeepMind/YouTube Scientists at Google-owned DeepMind have found its AIs behave almost the way humans do when faced with scarce resources. In a new study, DeepMind scientists plugged its AI agents, trained with deep reinforcement learning, into two multi-agent 2D games to model how conflict or cooperation emerges between selfish participants in a theoretical economy. As DeepMind explains, they trained their AI agents to behave the way some economists model human decision making. That is, selfish and always rational. "The research may enable us to better understand and control the behaviour of complex multi-agent systems such as the economy, traffic, and environmental challenges," DeepMind's researchers explain in a blog. In one game two agents, a red and a blue dot, are faced with the task of gathering apples represented by green dots. The agents can simply collect apples together, suggesting cooperation, or they can 'tag' the other to prevent them collecting apples. After several thousand rounds, they found that when there's an abundance of apples the agents collect as many as possible and leave each other alone. However, when DeepMind restricted the supply, the agents became more aggressive, figuring out that it may be optimal to block their rival to boost their chances of taking what's available. "The Gathering game predicts that conflict may emerge from competition for scarce resources, but is less likely to emerge when resources are plentiful," they write in a new paper. "These results show that agents learn aggressive policies in environments that combine a scarcity of resources with the possibility of costly action. Less aggressive policies emerge from learning in relatively abundant environments with less possibility for costly action," they note. DeepMind also found that smarter agents with a larger network, enabling them to devise more complex strategies, tried to block their fellow gatherer more frequently, regardless of how much scarcity was introduced. However, a second game called Wolfpack produced different behaviors when they were equipped to devise more complex strategies. In this game, two wolves represented by red dots work together to capture the blue dot prey and face the risk of losing the carcass to scavengers. If the wolves cooperate, they can get a higher reward since two wolves are better at protecting the catch than one. In this case, DeepMind found that a greater capacity to implement complex strategies resulted in more cooperation. DeepMind found that in Wolfpack, cooperation behavior is more complex and requires a larger network size because agents need to coordinate hunting to collect team rewards. Image: Google DeepMind/YouTube They also found the wolves developed two different strategies for killing the prey and protecting the carcass. "On the one hand, the wolves could cooperate by first finding one another and then moving together to hunt the prey, while on the other hand, a wolf could first find the prey and then wait for the other wolf to arrive before capturing it," they note in the paper. DeepMind offers this explanation for why network size made the agents more competitive in the gathering game, yet more cooperative in the hunting game. "In Gathering, defection behavior is more complex and requires a larger network size to learn than cooperative behavior. This is the case because defection requires the difficult task of targeting the opposing agent with the beam whereas peacefully collecting apples is almost independent of the opposing agent's behavior," they write. "In Wolfpack, cooperation behavior is more complex and requires a larger network size because the agents need to coordinate their hunting behaviors to collect the team reward, whereas the lone-wolf behavior does not require coordination with the other agent and hence requires less network capacity," they write.

Like being able to move around the real world with less fear of bumping into things, or being able to interact with said real world as well as a virtual one at the same time. That’s why when there was a need for an immersive and hi-tech experience, a group of organizations and companies turned to the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro and Google’s Tango augmented reality platform to create “Into the Wild”, an experience that aims to not only delight the eyes but also touch the heart. “Into the Wild” is no simple augmented reality experience. Just look at the names of the companies and organizations that worked together to make it possible, from Lenovo to Qualcomm to Panasonic to the World Wide Fund for Nature, a.k.a. the WWF. Developed by digital creative agency MediaMonks in collaboration with acclaimed Singaporean filmmaker Brian Gothong Tan, the AR experience takes place inside Singapore’s ArtScience Museum and highlights the precarious situation of many of the world’s endangered animals as well as the need for regrowing trees for both animals and humans alike. The technological center of “Into the Wild” is none other than the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, billed as the world’s first Tango-enabled smartphone. Google has been working on this augmented reality platform for years but it has always been available on devices designed for and marketed at researchers and schools. With the recent push in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, having a highly portable device that transports you into another world in an instant is no small matter. For a brief recap of its capabilities, the Phab 2 Pro is able to track motion, sense depth, and learn about the real three-dimensional world, thanks to its slew of sensors and the processing prowess of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 652. The “Immersive Virtual Adventure” starts right at the entrance of the ArtScience Museum, where visitors can pick up a “Phab 2 Pro on a stick” that they will use a window to the virtual world, while still being able to see and interact with the real world. Like many guided and interactive museum exhibits, there are set areas where events occur, but unlike those fixed exhibits, you move around the museum to look for those areas. You begin by following telltale clues, like virtual grass on the museum floor. It’s almost like a virtual treasure hunt. In certain walls, nooks, and crannies, you will be treated to a viewing of some of the endangered species indigenous to the region, like mousedeers, pangolins, orangutans, and even tigers. And these aren’t just pictures or even simple recorded videos. These animals react to the activity of the people in the real world, usually by running away. There are some cases, however, where museum goers will be able to interact with said critters. For many people, this is the closest they will be able to get an interactive “face to face” experience with such animals, either because they are too dangerous or too few to see in the wild. That said, do not expect a high fidelity representation of the animals, as they are represented in a more stylized manner befitting a virtual recreation of their natural habitats. “Into the Wild”, however, isn’t no mere entertainment experience. It isn’t even just a simple educational one. While it does demonstrate the various facts about these animals, it also prods people to actually take action, which is where the interactivity of augmented reality kicks in. For example, at one point in the tour, the surrounding areas in the screen suddenly turn red, recreating the effects of a forest fire and the dangers it poses to animals. There will also be times when users are instructed to interact with the virtual objects, like freeing a mousedeer from a man-made trap. But the biggest interaction comes in the form of seeds, which is where an AR experience in one small corner of the world has the potential to affect the real world at large. At certain places along the path, one will come across seeds that can be collected by the viewer. These seeds can then be planted at the museum’s virtual rainforest. When this action is accompanied by a pledge with the WWF, a real tree will also be planted (some time later, of course) in Rimbang Baling in Indonesia, one of the last remaining pristine rainforests in Southeast Asia and home of the endangered Sumatran tiger. Virtual reality is still at its infancy in the consumer market and still hasn’t shed off its stigma as a predominantly entertainment-oriented technology. While augmented and mixed reality are often billed as something that can be also be used for productivity, it has mostly been limited to more personal uses. “Into the Wild”, the first large-scale Tango production in Asia, demonstrates how technology and tech companies can come together to offer not just an exciting new way to experience the impossible but to also provide a means for people to do good, both in the virtual world as well as the real one.

The agreement is the outcome of roundtables instigated by the government’s Intellectual Property Office and could take affect this summer. While the music industry’s regular ranting about YouTube has been particularly newsworthy in recent years, the record companies have been griping about Google’s search engine for much longer. Rights owners wish that Google – and other search engines – would do more to stop search results including links to copyright infringing material, especially high up in those result lists. Google, of course, allows rights owners to request the removal of links that go through to unlicensed content, but they must do so on a link-by-link basis, rather than being able to ask the search engine to remove anything that links through to sites like The Pirate Bay. The web firms insist that they can’t be the police of the internet – and express concerns about site-wide delisting – though the record industry counters that where a court has ordered web-blocks against sites like the Bay, there shouldn’t be any such concerns. The record industry has been pushing the Googles of this world to do more in this domain for years. Google has introduced some anti-piracy initiatives, but for the music industry those haven’t gone far enough – indeed some at the labels would accuse the web giant of mainly paying lip service to its responsibilities in this domain, rather than actively pushing links to copyright infringing content down or preferably off its search lists. To that end, the music industry – especially in the UK – has been quietly lobbying government for it to introduce new rules to oblige search engines to play ball, most recently as part of the ongoing Digital Economy Bill discussions. It was during a debate on the DEB in the House Of Lords earlier this week that government rep Peta Buscombe revealed that not only were talks between the search engines and the copyright industries ongoing in a bid to create some sort of voluntary code for combating piracy, but it seems like some progress has been made. Said Buscombe: “IPO officials have chaired a further round-table meeting between search engines and representatives of the creative industries. While there are still elements of detail to be settled, the group is now agreed on the key content of the code and I expect an agreement to be reached very soon. All parties have also agreed that the code should take effect, and the targets in it be reached, by 1 Jun this year”. She added: “The search engines involved in this work have been very co-operative, making changes to their algorithms and processes, but also working bilaterally with creative industry representatives to explore the options for new interventions, and how existing processes might be streamlined. I understand that all parties are keen to finalise and sign up to the voluntary agreement, and so we believe there is no need to take a legislative power at this time”.

This is according to a new report from OC&C Strategy Consultants, Google and PayPal UK – The Mobile Mandate. The report is based on an exclusive dataset of search and transaction data from Google and PayPal UK, with analysis by and additional research from OC&C. It finds that a further c.£14bn of online retail will involve a smartphone in the research and price comparison phase, making mobile central to 80% of all UK e-commerce by 2020. Despite consumers’ rapid shift to mobile, overall, UK retailers are lagging behind US and Asian competitors on mobile readiness. According to consumer research undertaken as part of the report, speed is the most important factor when shopping online, but on average, leading UK retailer sites are between 10% and 25% slower to load on smartphone than their US counterparts. Google research shows that improving load times by 1 second can increase conversion rates by almost one third (27%). Furthermore, half of Britons (48%) would prefer customer support via mobile chat, but only 16% of the top 100 UK retailers offer this service. More than twice as many of the top 100 US retailers do so (41%). More people use messaging apps each month (3bn+ active users) than social networking sites (2.5bn active users), but few top UK retailers have a presence on a messaging platform. Meanwhile, in China, c.250m consumers made a purchase through WeChat in 2016. Alex Mathers, Associate Partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants explains: “Smartphone shopping is taking over online retail, bringing with it fundamental changes in how, when and where people shop. Brits are shopping more whilst out and about, they’re using mobile to research and compare prices for later purchases, and they’re spending more on mobile while in-store – very often with other retailers. There’s money to be made by tapping into these changing behaviours, but on the flip side, retailers that fail to adapt will find themselves haemorrhaging customers. Right now, the average UK retailer’s strategy should be mobile first – in a few years, it may well be mobile only.” Growth in mobile’s share of the overall e-commerce market is underpinned by a fundamental change in shopping behaviour and demands. In 2016, c.£1.5bn was spent by UK consumers on their smartphones whilst out and about – travelling, commuting and in cafes. A further c.£1.25bn was spent while in store, around £500m of this with a different retailer. Currently, two thirds of this (c.£1.5bn) is spent by time-pressured consumers rushing to purchase items for imminent events. More than one third (39%) of consumers trust information they find online more than store assistants. These trends are expected to accelerate as mobile seizes share of online retail. Mathers continues: “There are many things retailers could be doing to make the most of mobile, but the key to success lies in a few high impact items which together can give them a competitive edge. First, develop a presence on messaging platforms. With more active users than social networks and growing, messaging apps have huge e-commerce potential. In the next ten years, platform presence may well be more important for retailers than having an app. Second, use mobile as the glue between online and in-store. Simple things like providing in-store Wi-Fi, to more advanced digital loyalty schemes, mobile-enabled barcode scanning and in-store wallets are already generating significant engagement, data and conversion benefits for the likes of Topshop, Tesco and Target. Finally, and most importantly, make speed king. Improve load times, but also help consumers complete their mission as quickly as possible – streamline the journey, and help users work cross-device via things like basket sharing, wish-lists and sharing recently viewed items across devices.” Martijn Bertisen, Sales Director at Google UK, adds: “Mobile technology continues to be one of the key drivers in transforming the retail industry and consumer shopping experience. Consumers are increasingly relying on their smartphones for information around shopping and locations in moments that matter: the ‘I want to know…’, ‘I want to go…’ or ‘I want to buy…’ moments. With a plethora of searches, each showing an intent or a behaviour, there is a great opportunity for retailers to offer useful products and information, just when shoppers are looking for it. As consumers become accustomed to this way of shopping, retailers need to respond by providing a swift and seamless online service – and the best way to do this is by putting mobile at the heart of their marketing, loyalty and e-commerce strategy.” Rob Harper, Mobile Commerce Director at PayPal UK, says: “Speed is an important factor in any shopping experience, but when it comes to mobile shopping it’s vital. Retailers can reduce the time it takes to browse and select a purchase but if it takes too long to pay, they may lose that sale. It’s a problem that retailers can easily address with one-click checkout services like PayPal One Touch.” Harper concludes: “The next evolution of mobile shopping will reduce the consumer journey even further. Contextual commerce will enable consumers to buy things at the point of discovery – whether that’s in an email, on a Pinterest page or in a messenger app – rather than needing to click through to an online shop. Mobile technology is determining the future of e-commerce, and retailers need to act now to prepare themselves accordingly.” Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

By Owen Hughes February 10, 2017 12:08 GMT VR support will come to other headsets including Google Cardboard in the coming monthsGoogle Surfing the web just got a lot more exciting for Daydream View owners. Google has updated its web browser to support virtual reality (VR), meaning you can now explore a range of VR experiences on Chrome using your Android smartphone and Google's Daydream VR headset. Provided you have a Daydream-ready phone like the Google Pixel, Moto Z or Huawei Mate 9 Pro you'll be able to check out a variety of VR experiences available online using Daydream View. To do so, all you have to do is navigate to the site on your smartphone, load up what you want to watch and plonk it into the headset. If you don't have a headset you can still view VR content on any smartphone or desktop computer and look around using your finger or mouse. Needless to say, this way is a lot less fun. Daydreamers have a few VR experiences to choose from. More than two dozen films from VR studio Within can now be accessed via Chrome for Android and watched using Daydream View, as can over 300,000 virtual tours of celebrity homes, museums and landmarks on Matterport. WebVR lab is an online VR playroom you can interact with using Google Daydream and a controllerGoogle You can also play around in the WebVR lab from Playcanvas, which lets you throw blocks, play records and shoot confetti all over a VR playroom using Google's Daydream headset and motion controller. Meanwhile, Sketchfab lets you check out user-generated 3D designs from millions of artists, including anime and video game characters, 3D environments and famous works of art. While the list is somewhat limited for now, it's likely to grow in time as more developers get on board the Daydream boat. Google project manager Megan Lindsay said that VR support for Chrome would expanded to other virtual reality headsets in the coming months, including Google Cardboard. Sketchfab lets you view 3D artwork from millions of creatorsGoogle "Virtual reality lets you tour the Turkish palace featured in Die Another Day, learn about life in a Syrian refugee camp first-hand, and walk through your dream home right from your living room," Lindsay said. "With the latest version of Chrome, we're bringing VR to the web – making it as easy to step inside Air Force One as it is to access your favourite webpage.

Apple has HomeKit, Amazon has Alexa and Google has Google Assistant which, until now, had those features limited to just the Google Home device.  With the latest version of Android (in beta form) you can control your smart connected devices just by saying "Ok Google - switch on the living room lights." Adding smart home product control to your Pixel or Pixel XL's built in Assistant is fairly simple, although its usefulness will very much depend on whether or not you have the supported products. So far, the list is relatively limited: Honeywell Nest Philips Hue SmartThings WeMo The first step is making sure you have the right software installed, at the moment that means running the latest beta version of Android 7.1.2. If your phone isn't registered in the beta program, you can do that simply by heading to Google's sign up page. Bear in mind that beta software isn't the final release software, so might not run the most smoothly, or have some problems with it. How to setup Google Assistant to control your smart home Launch the Google Assistant as normal by tapping and holding the virtual home button, or saying Ok Google. Tap the dots in the top right-hand corner of the Assistant's pop-up card to bring the side menu up, then tap "Settings". You'll see a "Home Control" option, which you should select. If you don't see this menu, try asking Google Assistant instead: say "turn my lights on" and you'll be given a link to the Home Control menu.  The Home Control menu shows devices and rooms. Tap the little floating "+" button in the bottom corner, and you'll see a list of compatible manufacturers (listed above) and you can add devices. You'll be asked to sign-in to the relevant service. You'll be asked to assign devices to a room, allowing commands like "turn my living room lights off". Once completed, you can now say "Ok Google, turn on my lights and it will work". You'll notice that we said you might not get the Home Control menu in your Settings. We've got smart home control working on a couple of devices, but the menus are different. If you find you don't have access in the settings menu, then it's worth talking to Google Assistant to bring up the menu instead.  If you say "Ok Google, turn on my lights" and you have no devices set-up, the Google Assistant will suggest the Home Control menu instead. Of course, once you set up the lights, you'll have to say something else, like "Ok Google, turn my heating on". Again, if you don't have heating set-up, you'll then be prompted with the Home Control menu and so on. We imagine that this will be resolved as software is updated.  Sections Google Phones Smart Home Mobile World Congress 2017: Nokia, Sony, Huawei, smartphones and more When is Android 7.1.1 Nougat coming to my phone?

The inside story of the rise and rise of Uber Posted Feb 7, 2017 by John Biggs (@johnbiggs) 0 SHARES Next Story HPE becomes a Mesosphere reseller Advertisement Brad Stone’s new book, The Upstarts, recounts the surprising rise – and possible fall – of the sharing economy. By looking at Uber and AirBnB, Stone brings life and drama to the origin stories of how a few lucky guys made the right decisions at exactly the right time. What follows is an excerpt detailing the rise of Uber. Back in the summer of 2013, just as Silicon Valley investors were moving from optimism to outright exuberance, Travis Kalanick set out to raise Uber’s fourth round of financing. Colleagues say Kalanick set the terms of the financing round himself. He initiated discussions with half a dozen large investors and ran the process as an auction, searching not just for the most capital at the highest valuation, but for a powerful partner who could facilitate Uber’s coming global expansion. Yuri Milner’s fund, Digital Sky Technologies, was involved in the bidding, as was the venture capital firm General Catalyst Partners. But ultimately Kalanick’s attention settled on the dominant technology company in the land—Google. Kalanick started talks with Google’s investment division, Google Capital, but gravitated to its older venture capital group, Google Ventures, or GV, and one of its partners, David Krane. Krane was an early Google PR manager turned investor with a penchant for wearing colorful designer sneakers. He wooed Kalanick with a vision of Google’s sixty thousand employees whose collective energies and 20 percent free time at work could be deployed to aid the Uber cause. Kalanick was intrigued by the idea of aligning himself with Google but wanted reassurances from the top and asked for a meeting with founder and CEO Larry Page. So one evening in August 2013, Kalanick checked into a suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in East Palo Alto, paid for by Google, and woke up the next morning for a ten o’clock meeting with the most powerful man in Silicon Valley. Krane had orchestrated an experience that would blow Kalanick’s mind. When Uber’s CEO came down to the lobby, a prototype driverless car from the Google X lab idled in front of the hotel, waiting to ferry him to Mountain View. Sitting in the front seat was a Google engineer who could answer all his questions. It was Kalanick’s first ride in a self-driving car on real roads. At the Google campus, Kalanick met with Page, Google senior lawyer David Drummond, and Krane’s boss at GV at the time, Bill Maris. Page assured Kalanick that the companies could work together to develop Google Maps, which Uber relied on for navigation in its apps, but he didn’t say much or stay very long. The more important legacy that day was Kalanick’s developing awareness of the technology that might radically change Uber’s business. “The minute your car becomes real, I can take the dude out of the front seat,” Kalanick told Krane excitedly after the meeting. “I call that margin expansion.” In Kalanick’s estimation, payments to drivers were contra-revenue—a deduction from the top line. The inevitable future of robot cars was going to be awfully good for his business, he surmised. Krane thought he’d sealed an exclusive investment for Google Ventures after a subsequent four-hour meeting with Kalanick and Uber’s head of finance, former Goldman Sachs exec Gautam Gupta. But it wasn’t done quite yet. That night, Kalanick called Krane and told him he also wanted to include a second investor in the round: TPG Capital, the San Francisco private equity firm that had engineered leveraged buyouts of such companies as Continental Airlines, J. Crew, and Burger King. Kalanick wanted the experience and connections of TPG’s legendary founding partner David Bonderman, then a board member at General Motors, and thought he could help Uber with its regulatory problems around the world. Google invested $258 million in the ridesharing company. David Drummond joined the Uber board, while Krane joined as a board observer. TPG invested $88 million, buying shares directly from founder Garrett Camp and obtaining a provision that allowed the firm to get additional shares if Uber’s valuation ever fell below $2.75 billion, says a person familiar with the deal. Clearly nervous about investing in a startup, the private equity firm was hedging its bets; it also received an option to buy another $88 million worth of stock at the same price within six months. David Bonderman joined the Uber board as a director while his colleague David Trujillo, who had orchestrated the investment, joined as a board observer. (Bench- mark also invested another $15 million, and the rapper and entrepreneur Jay Z agreed to invest $2 million—then wired Uber $5 million, hoping for a larger stake. Although Kalanick was impressed by the brash move, he returned the difference.) Uber’s coffers were now brimming. After the round closed, Kalanick climbed aboard TPG’s Gulfstream jet with Bonderman, TPG co-founder James Coulter, and Trujillo, as well as investor Shervin Pishevar and his partner Scott Stanford, to visit countries in Asia and gauge the company’s expansion opportunities there. The world seemed wide open. Yet nearly every assumption Kalanick and his investors were making about the future in the fall of 2013 turned out, in the end, to be at least partially incorrect. Google was reluctant to cede the results of its driverless car research to another company and would soon look more like Uber’s mortal enemy, not its ally. Within a year, David Bonderman would leave the board of General Motors, which in 2016 would make a sizable investment in archrival Lyft. And remarkably, according to multiple people familiar with the transaction, when the time came for TPG to purchase its second $88 million allotment of Uber shares at the same valuation, the private equity firm wavered and waited until the last possible moment before attempting to exercise the option. Characteristically stingy about giving out Uber stock and diluting the ownership stakes of existing investors, Kalanick declined the transaction. Calculating for the dramatic rise in Uber’s value between that round and the end of 2016, TPG’s lack of faith ended up costing the firm hundreds of millions in unrealized gains. The biggest miscalculations may have been Kalanick’s own. Latest Crunch Report Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Asia would prove more challenging and costly than he had ever anticipated. He especially misread the atmospheric shifts in Silicon Valley’s fund-raising climate. “Emil,” he had said gleefully to Emil Michael, his new vice president of business development, after closing the investment from Google and TPG, “we’re never going to have to fund-raise again.” Emil Michael was disappointed to learn that Kalanick thought Uber’s financing efforts were over—he considered fund-raising one of his talents. Born in Cairo, Michael had immigrated with his family to the United States as an infant, graduated from high school in New Rochelle, New York, and earned an undergraduate degree from Harvard University and a law degree from Stanford. He had a brief stint at Goldman Sachs before decamping to Silicon Valley in 1999, right at the peak of the dot-com bubble. During his ten years in the industry, Michael had cultivated a reputation as being effective, loyal, and upbeat. He first met Kalanick in 2011, when he was taking a hiatus from high tech to work in the White House as a special assistant to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Kalanick tried to recruit him to join the startup, but at the time Uber looked like a luxury town-car service, not a worldwide transportation juggernaut. Michael was skeptical that it could ever be a big business. But Michael remained friendly with Kalanick and by the time he joined Uber, in the fall of 2013, he recognized that Uber’s future was brighter than he had originally believed. While Uber Black remained one and a half times more expensive than a traditional yellow taxi, UberX was, on average, 25 percent less expensive and was starting to dominate the emerging rideshare wars. Lyft and Sidecar had introduced ridesharing, but when Uber started aggressively rolling out the service, first in the United States in 2013 and then in Europe in 2014, the two rivals struggled to keep up. Uber had a more established brand and more money in the bank as well as upscale product lines, like Uber Black and Uber SUV, whose profits could be used to subsidize UberX rides and offer financial incentives to new drivers. Uber was growing 20 percent each month and, thanks to UberX, had gone from nonexistent to ubiquitous nearly overnight in San Francisco, Los Angeles, DC, and Boston. That fall, Uber had moved out of its cramped offices on Howard Street to more spacious digs a few blocks away, on the ninth floor of 706 Mission Street, around the corner from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Kalanick’s desk was across from Emil Michael’s, and the two would often peer at each other over their computer screens to marvel at new growth statistics. “We’d have these moments, asking each other, ‘Did you see this thing?’ ” Michael says. “It just kept going.” Some U.S. cities, such as Austin, Las Vegas, Denver, and Miami, resisted the arrival of unregulated ridesharing; amusingly, New Orleans sent Uber a cease-and-desist letter before it was even operating there. But Kalanick still had his trusty playbook as well as the political theorem known as Travis’s Law, which dictated that politicians accountable to the people could be pressured to accommodate any service that was markedly better than the alternative. In October 2013, most of Uber’s four hundred employees flew to Miami on another workation, staying in rooms in the ritzy Shore Club in South Beach. When employees weren’t at dinners or parties around the hotel pool, which had the giant U from the Uber logo illuminated on the water, they walked the beach handing out Uber postcards and affixing pro-Uber posters to light poles. The company’s campaign to drum up popular support to legalize ride-sharing in South Florida had a website, an Instagram page, and a Twitter hash tag: #MiamiNeedsUber. Miami was a challenging market for Uber. Private for-hire limos and sedans were required by law to wait an hour before picking up passengers and had to charge more than seventy dollars for the ride. The ordinance was backed by the region’s taxi fleets and meant to keep them safe from loosely regulated competition from limos and town cars. It didn’t stand a chance against sustained popular demand for ridesharing. Lyft and then Uber would open for business in Miami-Dade a few months after the visit by Uber employees. Though the companies’ services were still technically illegal, courts only occasionally levied fines against drivers, and the police didn’t shut down either service. By 2015, lawmakers were ready to change the rules. “Demand is too great,” Miami mayor Carlos Gimenez told the Miami Herald. “I’m not going to drag Uber and Lyft back into the 20th century. I think the taxi industry has to move into the 21st.” Uber was entering adolescence, winning political battles, growing, and adding executive talent. A few months before Emil Michael joined the company, Kalanick had also recruited a new chief technology officer, Thuan Pham.

Joining Uber as a senior executive meant a grueling interview process that included a cumulative thirty hours of one-on-one conversations with Kalanick. Pham reorganized Uber’s technical team, accelerated the hiring of engineers, and oversaw a complete revision of its dispatch algorithms and database storage systems to keep up with a business that was doubling every six months and showing no signs of slowing down. Pham’s impact at Uber was evident on New Year’s Eve, typically a night of frantic activity that had overwhelmed Uber’s systems for three straight years. “Thuan, if we have a system breakdown, I’m going to have an aneurysm and my death will be on your hands,” Kalanick told him earlier that day. But for the first time, Uber’s systems survived the night relatively unscathed. A few days later, Kalanick took Pham and his team out for a celebratory dinner and offered a rare bit of praise. “You did a great job,” Uber’s CEO said. Characteristically, the praise came with a new challenge. “From here on out, anything you can predict, I expect you to handle.” Over the next few months, Kalanick executed two ideas that further propelled the growth of UberX. The first, helping Uber drivers finance the lease of new vehicles, originated with former Goldman Sachs commodities trader Andrew Chapin, who was working as a driver operations manager in Uber’s New York office. Chapin had observed that the biggest obstacle facing many prospective Uber drivers was the lack of a vehicle; a lot of them didn’t own cars because they were immigrants with bad credit or no credit. Chapin thought Uber could help drivers obtain car leases and then divert a certain percentage of their earnings toward paying them off. The arrangement would pay dividends for the company, not only by putting more cars on the road but by ensuring that drivers devoted their energies to Uber rather than to rival ridesharing or delivery services. “The demand is there, but if we don’t help our partners and drivers get cars on the road, then it just doesn’t matter. We’re just not going to be able to grow,” Kalanick said that year. To canvass for interest in such a program, Uber executives visited car companies and auto-loan financers around the country. Their initial reaction was skepticism. “The car companies were like, ‘Yoober? Who are you guys? Aren’t you the town-car company?’ ” Emil Michael recalls. Kalanick, Michael, and investor Bill Gurley visited the Detroit offices of Ford Motor Company, often referred to as “The Glass House,” and met with executive chair- man William Clay Ford Jr., who was also noncommittal. Kalanick got a photo of himself with Ford, the great-grandson of founder Henry Ford, plus a tour of the company’s historic displays in the lobby, where Gurley recalls the Uber CEO got lost in reading about the automaker’s storied past. Ultimately, the big carmakers, GM, Toyota, and Ford, would sign on to the program, as would dealerships and auto lenders, and in time Uber would bring the financing in-house and make loans through its own subsidiary, Xchange. The program would be criticized for offering subprime loans with onerous terms and for repossessing vehicles when drivers didn’t make their payments on time. Michael argued that the program helped credit-challenged drivers who simply had no other options. “You are taking people who are already getting killed on loans and doing something better for them,” he says. “Of course the interest rate is high, but at least they have a chance.” While driver loans helped stimulate the supply of Uber cars, a second move helped to spark demand and was just as controversial. In early 2014, hoping to improve business during the annual winter slowdown, when people curtailed their nights out, Kalanick cut UberX fares by up to 30 percent in U.S. markets like Atlanta, Balti- more, Chicago, and Seattle. The theory was that if prices went down, customers would use the service more and bypass rental cars, public buses, and subways. With more passengers, drivers would spend less time idling between rides, replacing the lost income from the fare cuts by completing more rides. While the plan made sense, subsequent fare cuts would create unrest among drivers, and Uber would eventually have to reverse them in cities where lower prices didn’t spark higher demand. But it also accelerated the growth of UberX and, perhaps just as important, forced the less highly capitalized Lyft to introduce its own fare and commission cuts. Uber had discovered what startup gurus like to call the virtuous circle, the links between various parts of its business. Lower prices led to more customers and more frequent usage, which led to a larger supply of cars and busier drivers, which enabled Uber to further cut prices and put more pressure on competitors. Even Uber’s most fervent supporters had not grasped the true potential of the business. Uber wasn’t just taking passengers out of yellow cabs, it was growing the overall market for paid transportation. “I knew Uber was going to be big, but I didn’t know it was going to be so outlandish,” says venture capitalist Bill Gurley. “When we started testing lower price points, that’s when it was really ‘Oh my God.’ The price elasticity was impressive.” The increasing pace of the business surprised Kalanick himself. “I didn’t understand the scope of the Uber opportunity and I didn’t understand how the private equity and venture worlds would go to massively unprecedented places in order to be a part of that opportunity,” he says. Nothing could stop Uber now, it seemed, except perhaps itself. THE UPSTARTS by Brad Stone. Copyright © 2017 by Brad Stone.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > New features galore arrive on the ZTE Axon 7, but… New features galore arrive on the ZTE Axon 7, but Daydream VR is the most exciting By Andy Boxall — February 7, 2017 4:01 AM Subscribe Share Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here ZTE Axon 7 MSRP $399.99 DT Recommended Product Learn More Also mentioned Google Daydream View Samsung Gear VR Why it matters to you An update to the already excellent ZTE Axon 7 with Android 7.0 makes it the cheapest way to enjoy Google's Daydream VR. We’re about to give you another reason to buy the Axon 7 smartphone. ZTE says Android 7.0 Nougat will be available for the device from February 7, which means not only will it have the latest software version and some great new features, but also support for Google’s Daydream VR. Currently, this is primarily a feature on the Google Pixel phones, which cost several hundred dollars more than the Axon 7. Now, VR fans have a much cheaper way to get in on the Daydream fun. It’s worth it. Daydream VR is close to the experience offered by Samsung’s Gear VR, and way beyond the Cardboard viewer many will associate with VR on other Android phones. The Axon 7 slips into the front of the Daydream VR headset, but it’s not quite the same perfect fit as a Pixel phone. ZTE initially had some problems here, as the elastic strap securing the front of the headset to the body pressed down the Axon 7’s power button causing it to repeatedly turn on and off. To get around this, the update disables the power button when the Daydream software is running. More: All the best Android 7.0 Nougat tips and tricks We tried Daydream using the Axon 7, watching some YouTube VR videos and some games, where the phone’s excellent audio performance really stood out. It’s the stereo, front-facing speakers that do it. Compared to a single side speaker, it’s a much better experience. The Daydream app itself is easy to use, and the separate laser pointer-style controller makes navigation much more intuitive than the Gear VR’s side touch panel. Adding Android 7.0 also brings a few other features to the Axon 7. Side-by-side apps, an enhanced battery saver, and new emojis are all included. Also as part of the software update, ZTE will add Hiya’s phone spam protection and caller ID system, which is ready to get rid of robocalls and let you know who’s calling before you pick up the phone. It’s the first time a phone sold in the U.S. has free spam-call protection. Hiya operates from a library of 1.5 billion numbers, and has call blocking and an auto-block system. All this is great news, but once 7.0 Nougat arrives, the $400 Axon 7 will become the most cost-effective way to enjoy Daydream VR — and that’s even better. We already rate the phone highly, so it’s great to see ZTE continue to support it with a crucial software update that also adds several really desirable features. Axon 7 owners should be on the lookout for a notification of its arrival, and get in their orders for a Daydream headset.

LG G6's digital butler is expected to be much advanced than compared to Apple Siri and Microsoft Cortana. Rumour has it the LG G5 might come with not one, but two voice assistants. Rohit KVN   February 10, 2017 16:22 IST LG G6 teaser video hints at key design language elements; release details revealedLG Mobile Global via YouTube Since the beginning of 2017, South Korean consumer electronics major LG has been teasing several key features of its upcoming LG G6, such as big-screen with compact body having water-proof certifications, top-notch camera and long lasting battery. Now, the company, in its press invite to the media outlets has hinted that the flagship phone might come with advanced digital assistant, much sophisticated than Apple Siri and Microsoft Cortana, among others. "LESS ARTIFICIAL. MORE INTELLIGENT. The NEXT GENERATION SMARTPHONE, BROUGHT TO YOU BY LG. 26.2.17. #LGG6"— LG says in its G6 invite (courtesy, ZDNet) teaser. Also read: WhatsApp releases long awaited security update; here's how to enable two-step verification feature This apparently has led many to believe that LG might incorporate the new generation Google Assistant. Some people might think this as far-fetched, as why Google would give away a proprietary feature to a third party phone-maker, which will eventually compete with its own Pixel phone series. Well, earlier this week, LG launched Android Wear 2.0-powered Watch Sport and Style with Google Assistant feature, which were also designed in collaboration with the Mountain View-based company. There's more... CNET, a well renowned tech publication, believes that the upcoming phone might also house a second digital assistant in the form of Amazon Alexa, based on the fact that LG has integrated Amazon Alexa in some of its smart-home appliances including the SmartThinQ Hub and the Instaview refrigerator. So far, LG has not made any official comments on the speculations. But, we are certain, the company will soon reveal through teasers in coming days. The launch day of February 26 is less than three weeks way and its Korean peer Samsung is skipping the Galaxy S8 (with digital assistant—Bixby/Hello) series launch at the World Mobile Congress (MWC) 2017 in Barcelona. So, LG will be battling with Nokia for limelight and in a bid, to grab more attention, it might actually reveal the name of the digital assistant. Only Nokia is tipped to launch flaghip phone dubbed as Nokia 8. The rest of the rival brands --Lenovo's Moto and BlackBerry -- are expected to announce mid-range phones. Read more: Top 5 most-anticipated phones to be launched in February 2017: Moto G5, Nokia 8, LG G6 and more LG G6: What we know so far As per the information gathered so far, LG G6 is expected to boast LCD-based QHD (2560x1440p) screen with 18:9 aspect ratio. In the official teaser, the company hints LG G6 will have a wide screen, durable (water-proof) body, reliable (long lasting) battery and a really good camera with wide angle view of field. It is also said to boast wireless charging, contact less payment (LG Pay) and advanced Iris scanner. Unlike Samsung's infamously retired Galaxy Note 7, which had a dedicated IR-based scanner, LG device's ocular-based biometric technology will also make use of front camera for more accurate reading of the Iris and reduce false rejection ratio. Other expected features of LG G6 include: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 quad-core processor, 4GB or 6GB RAM, 32GB or 64GB storage. Watch this space for latest news on LG G6 and MWC 2017.
