Eclipse, which started out as a Sony PlayStation VR game, seems to have gotten a new life on Google’s Daydream platform. A new trailer from its developer White Elk Studios has the full title of the game and the “Only on Daydream” banner included. Eclipse: Edge of Light is set on a sentient planet where you crash land on. You’ll come across an artifact that will let you interact with the ancient technology and elements found there so you can gain powers and discover the secrets of said planet. Unfortunately, there isn’t a release date for the game just yet.

The U.S. company said in a blog post Friday it would give clients more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites. The announcement came after the U.K. government and the Guardian newspaper pulled ads from the video site, stepping up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform. France’s Havas SA, the world’s sixth-largest advertising and marketing company, pulled its U.K. clients’ ads from Google and YouTube on Friday after failing to get assurances from Google that the ads wouldn’t appear next to offensive material. Those clients include wireless carrier O2, Royal Mail Plc, government-owned British Broadcasting Corp., Domino’s Pizza and Hyundai Kia, Havas said in a statement. “Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network’s ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect,” said Paul Frampton, chief executive officer and country manager for Havas Media Group UK. Later, the parent company Havas said it would not take any action outside the U.K., and called its U.K. unit’s decision “a temporary move.” “The Havas Group will not be undertaking such measures on a global basis,” a Havas spokeswoman wrote in an email. “We are working with Google to resolve the issues so that we can return to using this valuable platform in the U.K.” The decision to pull ads from Google followed a Times of London investigation that revealed ads from many large companies and the U.K. government appeared alongside content from the likes of white nationalist David Duke and pastor Steven Anderson, who praised the killing of 49 people in a gay nightclub. Google made $7.8 billion in advertising revenue in the U.K. in 2016, accounting for 8.6 percent of the company’s total sales. The boycott signals a growing backlash against so-called programmatic trading, which automates the buying and selling of advertising online, and social media providers that are seen to not be doing enough to tackle hate disseminated on their platforms. Online Clash Media-buying firms are also increasingly resentful of the power wielded by Google and Facebook Inc., claiming the two companies operate a global duopoly over online advertising. The controversy about ads appearing in inappropriate contexts may give these media buyers leverage in negotiations with the social media giants. Martin Sorrell, the founder and chief executive officer of WPP, the global advertising firm, said in a statement that Google and Facebook have “the same responsibilities as any media company” and could not “masquerade” as mere technology platforms. He said WPP’s GroupM, a major ad buyer, was talking to Google “at the highest levels to encourage them to find answers to these brand safety issues.” Ronan Harris, Google’s U.K. managing director, said in the blog post that Google removed nearly 2 billion offensive ads from its platforms last year and also blacklisted 100,000 publishers from the company’s ad sense program. Despite this, Harris wrote, “we don’t always get it right.” Harris said Google had “heard from our advertisers loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content.” Policy Review The company will now review its policies and said it would be making changes “in the coming weeks” to help customers stop their ads appearing on objectionable websites or against offensive videos, Harris said. Ads appeared “next to extremist and hate-filled videos,” prompting Guardian News & Media to stop all advertising through YouTube parent Google, the British publisher said in an emailed statement Friday. The U.K. government said it suspended advertising on YouTube until the site can ensure they’re not placed next to content it doesn’t approve of. “Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content,” the U.K. government said in an emailed statement. “We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way.” Britain, Germany Britain’s government said it summoned Google for discussions to explain how it can guarantee the state’s demands are met, while on Tuesday Germany threatened to fine social networks such as Facebook as much as 50 million euros ($53 million) if they fail to give users the option to complain about hate speech and fake news or refuse to remove illegal content. British supermarket chain J Sainsbury Plc., whose ads appeared on videos posted by the white nationalist Polish Defence League, said it and its sister brand Argos would immediately suspend all Google advertising. “It is unacceptable that Google is allowing our ads to be placed alongside these videos on YouTube,” the company said in an emailed statement. It said it was seeking “urgent assurances” from Google that the problems were being addressed. The Guardian said it would be withdrawing its advertising until Google could provide guarantees that the ad misplacement wouldn’t happen in future. “It is completely unacceptable that Google allows advertising for brands like the Guardian to appear next to extremist and hate-filled videos,” Guardian News & Media said. L’Oreal, the cosmetics brand, said it was unaware that ads it was running in connection with the Prince’s Trust, a charity founded by Prince Charles that helps train disadvantaged young people for work, were appearing on YouTube channels associated with extremists. “We are horrified that our campaign — which is the total antithesis of this extreme, negative content — could be seen in connection with them,” the company said in a statement. L’Oreal said it planned to work more closely with Google to make sure it didn’t happen again.

The latest was a major December update aimed at improving the game. There’s plenty to love about the latest changes, but it’s also causing problems for some. Here we’ll explain how to fix the “Device is not compatible” error while trying to update Clash of Clans on Android. Additionally, we have more details about Google accounts not syncing correctly for saved villages. It’s one of the most popular titles on Android and iOS. Millions of people play it daily. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen this error message, but recently it has been happening more frequently. Most other issues can be fixed with the instructions below. Read: Clash of Clans Updates: 7 Things We Want Next The last update added tons of level 11 troops, cheaper costs and other things. However, it also added some problems. In fact, some can’t update the game at all. As a result it can’t be played. This is a big issue, and hopefully the few suggestions below can help. If you haven’t updated you’ll see a notification upon launching the game that an update is available. You cannot play until you accept this, go to the Google Play Store, and update to the latest version of the game. Everything is fine for those on iOS, but Android users are being met with a very odd problem. Users are getting an error on the Google Play Store for Clash of Clans that says, “Device is not compatible with this version” and are unable to update. Supercell confirmed this is a problem, and has offered up a fix for those having issues. Players affected by "Your device is not compatible with this version", please try: Settings >App Manager>Google Play Store>Clear data/cache — Clash of Clans (@ClashofClans) January 26, 2016 If you can’t update, you can’t play. Some are even in an active Clan War and can’t update in order to fight before time runs out. Which as many can imagine, would be very frustrating. Update: On February 26th Supercell made some changes and had another small maintenance break to fix the device incompatible and other Google services issues. Let us know in the comments below if the problem is still going on. Update #2: On March 4th Supercell finally fixed the Google Play Store device not compatible Clash of Clans problem, as well as the Google Games ID and sync issue many users have been experiencing. According to them, those who were unable to sync their Google Games account to restore or save a village, and the thousands of users who couldn’t update, should all be able to download the latest update from the Google Play Store release late last night and this morning. Head into the Play Store, check for updates, and download it right now to get back to Clashing. Update #3: The new December Clash of Clans update made this issue appear again. Users have also experienced crashes while in global chat, chat logs being out of order and other small things. Supercell may release another optional update to fix this. Even people that have been using the same device for well over a year are having issues. We’re seeing reports all over Twitter that people with tablets, the LG G3, Galaxy S6 and other devices are all experiencing this error. I’ve updated a Galaxy S7, Nexus 6P, Pixel C tablet and Nexus 9 all without any problems. So we’re not sure what is causing this at the moment, or what Android devices are experiencing it. been playing #COC on the same phone for 3 months and today its telling me that my device is not compatible with this version @ClashofClans — EllisWard✌️ (@fan_paige_wwe) January 26, 2016 If you are trying to update Clash of Clans on an Android device but running into problems, there are a few potential fixes. There is either something messed up with the Google Play Store, or something Supercell did. They’re blaming it on the Google Play, and suggest users clear the Store cache or data to resolve it. Above are basic instructions, but below are screenshots to help those experiencing issues. Instructions To fix the Clash of Clans update “your device is not compatible with this version” error message, try clearing the Google Play Store cache, and then data. Next, restart the Google Play Store and accept the update again. Pull down the notification bar on your Android device and hit the gear-shaped settings icon, or find “settings” in the application tray. From here navigate to Apps, or App Manager. Next scroll down and find Google Play Store. Select this, and tap “Clear Cache or Data” as shown below. This should erase everything, and get rid of any corrupt files that seem to be causing this problem. Supercell claims this will fix the error. Multiple comments suggest it worked. Now go back and download the update. Other Options However, if this doesn’t solve the problem another option is to uninstall Clash of Clans and re-install it. Yes, that sounds scary, and no one wants to lose their entire village by uninstalling the game. You won’t. Obviously proceed at your own risk and use caution. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone If the game is backed up to Google+ or Google Games (an option in settings) your progress is saved. Meaning you can uninstall Clash, reinstall it, and restore your progress simply by going into settings and connecting to Google+, and it will restore your village in less than 10 seconds. However, if you never linked the two, this won’t work. So do not uninstall Clash of Clans unless you know it’s backed up. The guide above goes over a few details regarding transferring the game to a new phone, which is also how you can save progress. That said, if you can’t open the game you can’t link it to Google Games. Do not uninstall Clash of Clans unless you know it is saved. Conclusion This is a big problem. Supercell states that clearing the Google Play Store cache is your only option, and it should solve any issues. They’re currently looking into other options, and will offer up additional information if available. At the end of the day, did clearing the cache or data fix it for you? Let us know in the comments below. Those who fixed it using other methods, feel free to share it below. The December update was loaded with content and a Christmas theme. Expect a bug fixing update in 2017 along with removal of the winter theme. 240 Responses 01/26/2016 kim Reply No, it did not work for me. It is asking me to redeem and then asking for a code. 01/27/2016 Tyr Reply Heya! It didn’t work out for me at first until I cleared out my Google Play Services as well. Hope it helps! 01/28/2016 JUCARIBU Reply THAT WORK FOR ME THANKS 01/31/2016 Albertman Reply My clash restored and updated after i deleted the cache and data from google play store and play store services 02/02/2016 C. Sims Reply Listen to the man or woman lol… Delete all data in “Google Play Store” & “Google Play Services” from your phones settings… this guaranteed to work (then go back to Google play store, accept terms. Then update the app)… from what I know it works with newer phones, if not you could be out of luck. 04/19/2016 ScottManJo Reply Finally got all my favorite Supercell games loaded onto my Galaxy Tab E Lite. Be sure to clear out the Cache & Date from the following 3 apps: Google Play Services, Google Play Store AND Google Play Games. I was able to get CoC & Boom Beach by clearing the first 2 but only could get Clash Royale after clearing Google Play Games. Hope this helps! Good luck & god speed! 05/02/2016 Jeremy Reply ^^ had to do all 3 for mine to work also! Thanks. 07/17/2016 Michael Reply OMG DUDE THANKS!! I got the same device and got super nervous when I couldnt get clash of clans! Your a lifesaver! 10/26/2016 Arjun Reply Now This worked for me.. erazin all 3 of those.. 05/27/2016 Uhoh Reply Worked for me too. Thanks! 02/06/2016 Laryssa Reply I have the g4 it didn’t work for me. Won’t even come up when I search it. Neither does boom beach so I am guessing it has something to do with supercell. Very frustrating because I have been playing for over a year 04/24/2016 Emily Reply Same here, very frustrated and I can’t back it up as to is so I can’t uninstall and reinstall even if I could. 02/20/2016 Shaun Reply i am having this issue with needing a redeem code to even get on the play store now! 02/29/2016 Moaz Reply Thank you very much, it worked immedietly after i did these easy steps, am really grateful :-) thx again 03/20/2016 Logan Reply Didn’t work for me.

I have nothing to clear out. I don’t understand. 07/03/2016 wardojr Reply try updating play store service… 01/26/2016 sol goslin Reply No it diddnt work. I had hopes it would but no such luck. This sucks. I cant even get to the supercell customer service/help line. There may be other issues with this though. Im also noticing a significant drop in the speed of my device, so it may be something that either supercell got in its system, or someone hacked google and delivered a little viral surprise. If thats the case Im sure it will make itself known in a bigger than life fashion. Hopefully that isnt the case. Keep posting updates on what happens. A LOT of people are locked out of the game through this. 07/22/2016 Clara Icasiano Reply just uninstall in play games then install it again. Hope it works :) \ 01/26/2016 Tom Reply no…. 01/26/2016 Steve Reply Hi. I’m on an amazon fire tablet which doesnt support google+ so my game isn’t backed up.

This isn’t the first time and they always say the same fixes and is not working. He brought a new phone and 3_4 months , the same problem. And with their lack of customer service good luck on their emails telling you to contact them in the game. If not fixed soon I will retire my three accounts and so will my friend with four, and its sad seeing that we both spent over $150 on accounts each. 01/28/2016 Nathalie Blues Reply I have spent over $1300 and lead a clan where my friends have spent the same. This is not acceptable SuperCell. Get with the freaking program and fix this. Fix it now ! 01/26/2016 dan Reply Did not work for me either. Th 9 and 3 years of playing gone. They need to sort this shit out. That’s bullshit. 01/26/2016 Scott Reply Didn’t work on my galaxy s5 active. Thus is very frustrating being I’m in a active war and can’t attack.

What worked was clearing cache per the suggestion, but when doing the update go to my apps and bulk update all apps that need an update. If I went directly to COC under my apps I still got a message stating it wasn’t compatible. 01/26/2016 Dave Reply I deleted the game and now its completely gone from the google play store, same for boom beach 01/26/2016 Bethany Reply Nope didnt work 01/26/2016 Ryan Reply After just clearing the cache my problem was fixed . hope that helps everyone else 01/26/2016 LEI Reply Me too..tried to uninstall coc but unforunately when i try to download it again, cannot find coc in play store… Help pls… 01/26/2016 Anthony Williams Reply Didn’t work for my kindle fire. 01/26/2016 Bob the clasher Reply Figured it out!! MUST SIGN CLASH OF CLANS INTO GOOGLE PLAY! go to settings→apps→clash of clans and then clear data (i know scarry). Then go to play store and my apps. Click “update all” and clash of clans will be on the list. Once it has updated, click on the clash of clans icon. It will load and come up with a new village. DONT CLICK ANYTHING YET!!! In the top left corner it says “sign in” click that and something will pop and start loading. Wait until it says “Would you like to laod Chief Whateveryournameis village?

I cleared the cache in the store and game. That didn’t work. I uninstalled CoC. It didn’t show up in the Play Store. I went to Google Play Games app and was able to install from there. I had to restart the device before it would load.

Re-tried clearing the GP cache and data, still not available. 01/27/2016 Techymarkbo Reply For those not seeing in Google Play store after installing, You have to go to Google Play Games app in order to install after uninstalling. Your device is listed as not compatible so it will not show up. Also, if you find a copy of the new update By searching coc apk file on Google, it will install by side loading also. 01/27/2016 Techymarkbo Reply Here is a link to the latest download for sideloading. http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/supercell/clash-of-clans/clash-clans-8-116-2-android-apk-download/ 01/27/2016 Shawn Reply S5 being playing for a year now suddenly cant play, this is unacceptable, why was the upgrade not tested, when will you resolve it?! 01/27/2016 Umang Reply For everyone who’s facing this problem..go to Google play store through your browser, log in and install the game.

It did not show up on play store but yes did show on play game. Click install on play game redirect me to play store but is list under incompatible device. No install button after that 2. Read comment here and have tried clear cache, data and uninstall update for play store, play game, and play service. Still no luck. Not even show up in play store. 3. Post my comment here and back try again. It just suddenly show up. Install it and play.. No lag no issue. Around 1 hours of time for me to make that god damn stupid install button appear in my play store for doc game! Stupid conclusion from me after tried to install it. Someone say clear 3 time and bulk update. So, MAYBE after we have clear that, it will automatic download the update for playstore and it need sometime for that and without any notification on it. Give it some time after clear cache and data than try again. Hope that’s help. 01/27/2016 Sean Reply Motorola moto 3. Cleared cacache. Nope. Cleared data. Nope.

I decided to uninstall the game and check the store, where it still said my device (LG phone) wasn’t compatible. Vexing to say the least. The thing that did the trick was checking in Google Play Games (different application from Play Store) > My Games > Clash of Clans. I was able to download and install CoC from here and it worked.

If you want to keep your emails on Google's services more secure you'll need to do more than just enable two-factor authentication. You need to practice safe browsing, steering clear of sites and emails that could steal your info. Below are four third-party add-ons you can plug into Gmail to help your navigate the internet a little more safely. They range from add-ons to protect you from phishing attacks (when a hacker tries to social engineer your password out of you) to add-ons to keep Google from peeping at what you send through their email servers. 1) SecureGmail Image: SecureGmail Probably the best name for an add-on designed to improve Gmail security, and there's no doubt SecureGmail is very useful for the privacy-conscious — it encrypts and decrypts all the emails you send and receive in Gmail, before they ever reach Google's servers, so you know that if anyone else should try and extract the contents they won't be able to do so — including Google itself. At the other end the recipient of your email needs a specified password to understand and decode the message, but you don't have to apply this encryption to everything you send through Gmail, so you can save it just for the most sensitive stuff. Like all the best Gmail browser add-ons, it integrates with the original web interface in a clean and seamless way. 2) Ugly Email Image: Screenshot There are plenty of emailers out there who'd like to know when and where you open your messages so they apply a tracker to notify them when you've opened it. If you're not really into that kind of tracking behaviour then there's Ugly Email — add the extension to Chrome and you get a simple eye icon inside your Gmail account on the web if an email contains some kind of tracker. This add-on is for informative purposes only, so you can't really do anything about the tracking except choose not to open up the offending message or have words with the person who sent it, but we like its simple approach and ease-of-use. At the very least you become more aware of the sort of messages coming into your inbox, which is always useful. 3) Gmail Sender Icons Image: Screenshot As the name suggests, Gmail Sender Icons is a Chrome extension that puts favicon symbols next to senders in Gmail, so you can quickly visualise which domain each message is coming from. It gives you that same at-a-glance ease-of-use that you get when looking through the open tabs in your browser, but built right into your Gmail inbox, with virtually no slowdown in speed. So how does it keep you safe? It's another way of flagging spam emails that aren't from respectable sources, and you can spot the potentially dodgy messages before you open them up, or indeed use it to save genuine messages from the Spam folder. The extension itself doesn't store any data, simply parsing your inbox to come up with its labelling. 4) Password Alert Image: Google This last one is from Google itself: A Chrome extension that helps keep you safe against any phishing attempts that may wander into your inbox. It watches out for Google sign-in pages that aren't actually Google sign-in pages, and should you get duped into entering your account password, you'll then get an instant warning asking you to reset it to something else. The extension works by storing a "thumbnail" of your password for comparison purposes, rather than the password itself. And while Gmail already does a decent job of watching out for emails that aren't genuine, shifting them to the Spam folder so you don't get chance to be fooled, but there's no harm in upgrading your protection — plenty of us are still at risk. Comments PeterGills Guest Mar 20, 2017, 10:52am Simplest and best gmail security feature is to use googles own 2 factor authentication. Any new device you use will send a code to your phone. Simple and very effective. Reply 1 Fossa Team Guest Mar 20, 2017, 6:52pm PGP or S/MIME are good options to secure your Gmail. There are plenty of Gmail extensions to do it Maivelope, CryptUp, Jumble, FossaGuard, ...etc Why not mention them alongside with SecureMail? Reply 0 Join the discussion!

You’ll need Bitmoji for Chrome and then you can access your Bitmoji anytime you need them. We’ll even show you how to integrate Gmail Bitmoji directly. This is the easiest way to use Bitmoji on Facebook, Messenger, Google Hangouts, WeChat and practically any other app on you Mac or PC. Right now you can only use Bitmoji on Mac or PC by installing the Google Chrome browser on your device. This is a free download that is compatible with most devices. If work locks down your computer, you may not be able to install Chrome. There is no Bitmoji Safari or Bitmoji Edge extension. How to use Bitmoji for Mac and PC. How to use Bitmoji on Mac & PC In less than five minutes you can start using Bitmoji on your computer. This is what you need to do to set up Bitmoji on your computer and how to use it. Download and Install Chrome. Install the Bitmoji for Chrome Extension Sign Into Bitmoji on your computer Click to add Bitmoji to Gmail if you want. Once you finish these steps, Bitmoji is installed on your computer. You access it in Chrome, but you can use it on a wide range of services and in a number of apps. Click the Bitmoji icon in Chrome and then copy any Bitmoji you want to use In Chrome, click on the small Bitmoji icon in the upper corner of the browser. This will open the Bitmoji picker that you normally see in the Bitmoji keyboard on iPhone and iPad. Your Bitmoji is already customized, so there is nothing else to do but start using it.

Click on the face to open the Bitmoji picker and then click on a Bitmoji to insert it in your email. There is no need to copy and paste. One problem that we ran into with Bitmoji for Chrome is that most of our Bitmojis would not load. If this happens, you can restart Chrome or if that doesn’t work sign out of Bitmoji and sign back in. The second step solved out Bitmoji Chrome problems. Everything We Expect Apple to Announce in 2017 iPhone 8   1 / 10 We expect the iPhone 8 from Apple this year. This is the flagship iPhone for 2017, and it may only come in one size.  Expect a huge 5.8-inch or 5.5-inch display in a phone that isn't much bigger than the iPhone 7. Apple will switch to OLED, like the screens on Samsung smartphones. Expect a new edge-to-edge display and to see Touch ID as part of a display with no physical home button.  Count on a completely new design, wireless charging and a faster processor to power what may be the most expensive iPhone yet.  We expect an iPhone 8 release date in the fall, shortly after an Apple event. iPhone 8 concept by Georgy Pashkov.     1 / 10 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Movies Latest Google Play Music Update Adds Wi-Fi Streaming And Playback Quality Options By Zara Ali Mar 16, 2017 17Shares Share Tweet Submit Google has updated its Play Music app, which now gives the app a full-blown functionality of Wi-Fi streaming and offline music. These new options have been placed under ‘Playback’ in Settings menu. Also, there is a new option that allows you to set “Quality on a wifi network.” Previously, Google only allowed the functionality for streaming quality on cellular networks. Within the new quality option, the default is always set to ‘Always High,’ which obviously playbacks the highest quality. However, with the high-quality playback, there might be some issues of buffering that is not a welcome pause, so you can always set the quality to Low, Normal, and High so that your music does not get interrupted due to network issues. Related Google Confirms That It Won’t Bring Google Assistant To Android Tablets Advertisement Besides, “Download quality” under ‘Downloading’ option is also segmented into three options – Low, Normal, and High. With ‘Low’ quality you can save storage on your device, but if you are an audiophile and can’t bear low-quality music then better set it to high. Also, it is not yet clear whether the already saved music can also be compressed and how much space it would save if they also get compressed. Google had been testing these features since long, and in the previous version of the app, many users could identify these additions. Today, Google has made them available to all the Play Music app users. It brings the app to version 7.5 on all devices. It is currently being rolled out to Android phones through the Play Store. The new update now lets the app stream and store songs at higher quality. It brings Google Play Music among other music streaming apps such as Spotify and Tidal that offer Wi-Fi streaming on higher bitrates. It must be noted that for downloaded audio, the file would eat up device storage while streaming over Wi-Fi could take a toll on data. Related Beware, Your Next Update From Google Could Actually Be a Downgrade! Do you use Google Play Music as your primary music streaming app? If yes, then let us know if you can see the latest additions to the app’s interface. Share your thoughts in the comment section below.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry Apple, Google and Facebook Have Backed Away From Fighting Trump’s Latest Travel Ban By Rafia Shaikh Mar 16, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Earlier in February, a number of tech companies had filed a legal brief opposing President Trump’s first executive order on immigration. Apple and Google were among the first to respond to this travel ban. However, these tech giants have now reportedly “backed away” from the legal fight against the second version of this travel ban. Apple, Facebook, Google, and others “skip” fighting the second travel ban “Apple, Google and Facebook are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban, deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order,” Reuters reported late last night. Related [Updated: More Join] Apple, Facebook, Google, Uber, and Others File Legal Brief to Oppose President’s Immigration Order While the first amicus brief that was filed to oppose the original executive order had received support from 127 companies, the latest brief filed in the federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed support of only 58 companies. Advertisement Microsoft, Dropbox, Netflix, Twitter, Intel, Kickstarter are some other companies that had supported the original brief but didn’t sign the latest one. However, while Reuters’ report is based on the fact that the above-mentioned companies haven’t signed the “friend-of-the-court” brief yet, they could still do so. For example, Uber was reported to be in the process of adding its name to the brief. Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. “We do expect the group to expand.” It should be noted that Google and Apple were among the most outspoken companies who not only signed the original brief but had also donated to the crisis funds. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had said it is “painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues”. Cofounder Sergey Brin was also spotted at a march at San Francisco International Airport. Apple CEO Tim Cook had written a letter to his staff, noting that “Apple would not exist without immigration“. Reuters added that while the lawsuit may have lost some big names, it is still likely to succeed. A Hawaiian judge last night ordered an emergency halt to the latest ban, saying that it would cause “irreparable injury” by violating First Amendment protections against religious discrimination.

It is also the reported codename Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is using for one of three rumored successors to the Google Pixel smartphone. The “taimen” may be one of three new Pixel phones due for release this year. The others — codenamed “walleye” and “muskie” — are reported to be 5-inch and 5.5-inch devices, respectively. The size of “taimen” is unknown, but one might safely assume that it would be bigger than either of the other two. A report Tuesday at Droid-Life confirmed the codenames for “walleye” and “muskie,” and included the possibility of a “taimen” phone. Google promoted its two Pixel phones — the Pixel and Pixel XL — heavily during the recent holiday season, and investment bank Evercore ISI estimated that the company sold more than 550,000 units in the United States during the fourth quarter of last year. Another estimate, from Monness Crespi Hardt, put worldwide quarterly sales at 1 million units. An initial estimate from Morgan Stanley projected total worldwide sales of 3 million units. The numbers pale, however, when compared with sales of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone, which sold 75 million units in the fourth quarter, or Samsung’s sales of the Galaxy S7, with 9 million unit sales in the phone’s first month of availability. Still, Google’s sales were good enough, and the critical reception was strong enough for the company to move ahead with a second version of the Pixel phones. There are some issues though. For instance, does Google’s exclusive deal with Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) as the only mobile carrier for the Pixel phones put a ceiling on sales? The phones are also available unlocked directly from Google or one of its retail partners, but that’s not the same as having the other three major U.S. carriers on board as well. For now, with nothing more than rumors to go on, it appears that Google is determined to make yet another push into producing hardware. Can it avoid another Nexus mess? Stay tuned.

Dan K: “TeenVogue pushing policy. Not an earth-shattering article in itself, but nice to see, the kids need to know.” Yes, so good to see Teen Vogue offering more to its young readers than make up tips. My teenage magazines sure never carried this kind of thing. Jeremy Scahill of The Intercept recently (March 8) had a Teen Vogue contributor on his Intercepted podcast. They had a long discussion on immigration. March 8 podcast transcript. He said: I’m joined now by independent journalist Aura Bogado. She recently has been contributing to Teen Vogue, a magazine that actually has emerged as an important news organization. It’s not a joke. It’s true. Teen Vogue is now a very good publication on the very issues that we talk about on this show and that we cover at The Intercept. I’ve worked with Aura before. I’ve known her for many years, and it’s a pleasure to welcome Aura Bogado to Intercepted. The current Teen Vogue issue has stories on Trump’s second travel ban being blocked, and military academy sexual assault. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef March 16, 2017 at 10:01 am Whether is sex or drugs, abstinence only education just doesn’t work. We can’t ban human nature – to be human is to engage in sex or…to be greedy….except many Zen monks. Greed – you can’t criminalize it any more than marijuana. Aborting the subsequent birthing of concentrated wealth is the way to go. Then we can live to learn with greed (and corruption – also human nature). But the wealth-abortion should be freely available. “We are here to help…to abort your concentrated wealth.” Reply ↓ Katniss Everdeen March 16, 2017 at 10:52 am It’s true: According to a new report from Child Trends, a nonprofit research organization that specializes in child health and development, increasing access to the full range of birth control methods — i.e. everything from the basic pill form to an IUD you have inserted — could reduce unintended pregnancies by 64 percent. 64 percent. What’s more? It also shows that it could reduce abortions by 67 (!) percent nationally, which would in turn cut related costs to our health-care system by $12 billion annually. At some point, you’ve got to start thinking that positions on this issue, particularly from pro-“lifers,” are about more than just the ardent fetus love they so vocally profess ad nauseam. Reply ↓ craazyboy March 16, 2017 at 11:36 am Always good to follow the money. But not to the point of becoming a groper, please. That would be rude. Reply ↓ Malcolm MacLeod, MD March 16, 2017 at 10:01 pm Linda, after a long and enjoyable career in general pediatrics in northern California, I can say with ease that ALL teenagers of any sex must become experts in all of the modalities of birth control, except for early withdrawal. Nowadays, the vast majority of them screw like rabbits, no matter what they proclaim. We used to lose a lot of the girls through criminal abortion, when BCPs, the morning after pill, diaphragms, ad nauseum were less available. In this enlightened age, we need more and better sex and fewer pregnancies. We were born to have sex and it’s not a luxury, but rather a blessed necessity, even though it causes heaps of trouble, and keeps all kinds of lawyers busy. Eventually, one must face up to reality. Reply ↓ vlade March 16, 2017 at 7:37 am While I agree with the general thrust of the FT “no back door for the City” article, one point I’d make is that while US kept USD clearing, it didn’t stop a large EuroDollar market to be created in the UK – although the reasons, conditions etc. were very different of course (not to mention that USD regulator didn’t really mind, and EUR regulator could well mind, especially if given a political task to do so). Otherwise, those who think no-SM-access-Brexit will have no significant impact on the UK finance are living in a lala land. Funnily enough, if Scots do get away with their independence, the next centrum – at least for Asset management, may well turn out to be Edinburgh (as quite a few AMs are already located there). Scots of course would have to wait to be admitted to the EU, or alternatively, join Ireland (together with NI), and maybe create “United Kingdom of Ireland and Northern Great Britain”. Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorMarch 16, 2017 at 8:45 am The US can and has very effectively used its control of dollar clearing to dictate terms to foreign players in $, witness Standard Chartered as the first big case, where Benjamin Lawsky wrote an order when they were caught out doctoring wires on a systematic basis to trade $250 billion (yes, correct order of magnitude, over a number of years) with Iran in defiance of sanctions. It really did pretty much say to the CEO: You are showing up in a hearing at this date and time to tell me why I shouldn’t yank your New York branch license” which would be catastrophic. Needless to say, despite screams of rage from Standard Chartered and every banking regulator in DC, Lawsky prevailed. In other words, if you clear, you are also providing the lender/liquidity provider of the last resort capability. You are gonna make sure banks do things your way for that privilege. The US could have prevented the growth of the Eurodollar business. I’ve read historical accounts with some detail as to the mechanisms that were available to stop it. There were reasons at the time the US thought it was to our advantage to allow it. I forget what they were, however. Reply ↓ vlade March 16, 2017 at 9:22 am That’s why I wrote “not to mention that USD regulator didn’t really mind, and EUR regulator could well mind, especially if given a political task to do so”. That said, the regulatory approaches to that can change as the political winds blow – but regardless of that (and it’s not something that would happen overnight, building EuroDollar took decade+ IIRC) after Brexit UK (including its finance industry) will be much different from what it is now. Reply ↓ Michael Hudson March 16, 2017 at 12:32 pm Yves, I remember very well why the US didn’t stop the growth of the eurodollar market in the 1960s. I was Chase’s BoP economist at the time. The single largest source of deposits was from Chase’s London office — eurodollars deposited with the head office. These deposits had NO RESERVE REQUIREMENT. A young kid was in charge of it, and outpolled the real estate and international departments.

Reply ↓ JTMcPhee March 16, 2017 at 11:23 am Yep, health care in no way equates to “medical UNsurance.” Reply ↓ Carolinian March 16, 2017 at 12:25 pm However his claim to be the Typhoid Mary of Neoliberalism may be true, at least for the US version. This was Washington Monthly’s organizing theme back in the early days. One should also say that some of his ideas were not taken up. For example, from the Post article This brings us to another fundamental tenet of neo-liberalism: We generally oppose requiring a law degree or similar paper credentials for most jobs. People should be judged on their demonstrated ability to perform, not on their possession of degrees and other credentials. Did you read that Paul Blair, an ex-major leaguer, was denied the right to coach high school baseball because he didn’t have a teaching credential? Another example of this concern is the recent criticism of Marva Collins, the black Chicago teacher who started her own school to help poor children. Some ofthe the criticism may be justified, but one charge — that she lacks a teaching certificate — is the sort of thing that makes me desperate, particularly since the press solemnly reported the charge without the slightest suggestion that a teacher’s certificate may not have any relation to teaching ability. The proof is that many of the best private schools do not require teacher’s certificates. What they care about is that the teacher can teach. Neo-liberals share this concern with actual performance because they want to encourage productivity and discourage the bureacratization that credentialism fosters. Peters also didn’t think much of the traditional press and so gets brownie points for that. Reply ↓ Grebo March 16, 2017 at 6:53 pm I’ve noted before that Peters’ Neoliberalism is not what we generally mean by Neoliberalism today, but was an attempt to resurrect the New Deal. Our Neoliberals are sworn to bury the New Deal. So I’m not sure that the accusation of hypocrisy in the the blurb is warranted. Reply ↓ UserFriendly March 16, 2017 at 7:21 pm As I noted in a follow up email that didn’t make the cut. yeah, it’s actually kinda shocking how spot on some of the criticism is. It really makes me feel like we are always solving the problems of our parents generation. Reply ↓ Procopius March 17, 2017 at 8:45 pm I was struck by: We have found these responses not only weren’t helping but were often hampering us in confronting the problems that were beginning to cripple the nation in the 1970s: declining productivity; the closed factories and potholed roads that betrayed decaying plant and infrastructure; inefficient and unaccountable public agencies that were eroding confidence in government; a military with too many weapons that didn’t work and too few people from the upper classes in its ranks; and a politics of selfishness symbolized by an explosion of political action committees devoted to the interests of single groups. That part sounds like he was writing today. I’ve come to think of the ’70s as kind of the line of demarcation. Most of the trends we think of as bringing about neoliberalism, the Washington Consensus, started under Jimmy Carter.

I was curious if I could care about [money] on some fundamental level, and I couldn’t. That wasn’t the metric of success that I wanted in my life. I’ve talked about this to my friends who are doctors and whose parents are doctors, or who are lawyers and their parents are lawyers.

Reply ↓ JoeK March 16, 2017 at 9:20 pm “I’ve tried really hard to care about things that were very different from my parents.” “Tried hard to care;” did she succeed in caring? If you have to try “really hard” to care, you don’t, really. Sounds like a Freudian slip. “were very different;” present perfect segues to simple past, another tell as to the sincerity (or rather lack thereof) of her caring. “from my parents;” she must mean “from my parents’ [pseudo-] concerns.” Most likely an unconscious attempt to distance herself from her progenitors (a reading bolstered by her thou-protesteth-too-much addition of “proudly as a daughter”). Let’s hope she’s not entrusted with teaching English Composition 101. As one of my writing profs. said, “clear writing requires clear thinking.” He’d doubtless give that one sentence alone a bath in red ink. The part about being “curious about $$$;” I think she’s hinting (again whether she consciously understands it or not) that curiosity is sufficient impetus to make marital vows (for one). Our overclass is just chock full of paragons of humanity. Reply ↓ Procopius March 17, 2017 at 9:39 pm Well, she says she doesn’t care about money. No matter how hard she tries, she just can’t do it. I guess it’s like the economists’ example of the different price of diamonds and water. Diamonds are only useful as an abrasive, while water is essential to life, yet diamonds are much more costly.

In addition, he is called to investigate an incident where whales and sea-borne mussels seemed to have attacked and incapacitated a commercial freighter. When he returns to his whale watching job, he witnesses how humpback whales and orcas attack the watcher’s boats. The whales work together to capsize the boats and then kill the people drifting in the water. A large number of tourists and close colleagues of Anawak are killed. The events that are witnessed by the protagonists are only part of a worldwide phenomenon. Several other attacks are briefly described in the plot: Swimmers are driven from the coast by sharks and venomous jellyfish. Commercial ships are attacked and sometimes destroyed in a variety of ways. France sees an outbreak of an epidemic that is caused by lobsters contaminated with a highly lethal type of Pfiesteria. When it becomes clear that all those events are related, an international scientific task force is created under the lead of the United States. The task force is led by Lieutenant General Judith Li, a close friend and adviser to the President; the protagonists become part of it.

If you believe Mary Hershberger’s unsparing account on the truthdig website – to be fair, there are vigorous and detailed denunciations of her report by McCain’s defenders – imprudent actions by McCain may have started the fire. What seems undisputed is his extremely Flashmanesque behavior in the immediate aftermath of the lethal inferno. McCain promptly quit the stricken ship with the late R.W. “Johny” Apple Jr., of the New York Times, who wrote him up in handsome terms a few weeks later. Thee flames still smouldering and the body bags barely zipped, McCain bounded into a helicopter and flew to Saigon for, in his own breezy words, “some welcome R&R”, even as somber memorials for his dead shipmates were held aboard the Forrestal. Flashman to the life. He then raced to London for an important private session with the man who would preside over the inquiry into the Forrestal disaster, the officer in question being his own father, Admiral John McCain, at that time the Navy’s top man in Europe, soon to become overall commander of all forces in Vietnam. ========================================================= Entire article is well worth reading.

And there’s a lot of people looking for it.’” ========================================= It wasn’t that long ago that the CIA spied on Senate staffers – Congress, undoubtedly acknowledging that they can’t keep a secret about anything other than donors, magnanimously forgave the CIA and associated surveillance. Former Dem rep: I got wiretapped during Obama admininstration (yes, its misspelled – I am not the editor of Hot Air) “However, what happened afterward is notable. Kucinich is correct that any conversation with a member of Congress that doesn’t involve a criminal investigation should have been off limits to intelligence operatives. They should have disconnected at that point and referred the matter to the DoJ, which could have discussed the contact directly with Kucinich if they felt it was important enough to investigate. Instead, not only did they stay on the line, they retained the recording, transcribed it, and archived it — and eventually leaked it to the media while identifying Kucinich. That is a swipe at the separation of powers and the concept of co-equal branches, treads dangerously close to political interference, and it closely resembles what happened to Flynn. The lesson here is that broad powers of surveillance will get used broadly, and the risk of abuse for political purposes is high. Congress should investigate Kucinich’s allegations along with Trump’s to see whether those abuses have happened, who knew about them, and whether agents had permission or orders to conduct it from political appointees in their organizations.” ====================== “Instead, not only did they stay on the line, they retained the recording, transcribed it, and archived it — and eventually leaked it to the media while identifying Kucinich.” AND “treads dangerously close” – if that isn’t kicking it and than running over it with a steamroller, I don’t know what is… And I note, leaked for what was obviously partisan purposes, OR if not partisan purposes, for CIA PURPOSES. Will Trump have the subtlety of mind to understand what happened and how to use it against his CIA opponents??? Will Trump have the gumption to really take on the IC, or has he already been transmogrified into a cold warrior by the McCain/Graham proselytizers? Its an outrage how much surveillance goes on. But this has shown that despite the high regard the media now holds the CIA in, the CIA confirms its right to rejigger an election (including USA) when the results don’t suit the CIA’s agenda. And if not that, than the appointees who get to serve in it. If the democrats involved in this, it is pretty bad. If it is the CIA alone, it is much worse. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood March 16, 2017 at 10:09 am With the CIA having become America’s Stasi, East German history becomes quite relevant in interpreting CIA behavior: Stasi officers discussed rebranding East Germany as a democratic capitalist country to the West, but which in practice would have been taken over by Stasi officers. The plan specified 2,587 OibE officers (Offiziere im besonderen Einsatz, “officers on special assignment”) who would have assumed power as detailed in the Top Secret Document 0008-6/86 of 17 March 1986. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi Apparently the CIA prefers to rule more invisibly through the threat of Zersetzung directed at errant politicians. It means secretly destroying their self confidence by leaking intercepted communications, damaging their reputation, organizing failures in their work, and destroying their personal relationships.

Clicking that link brings up a menu, one of whose options is “Advanced”. Choose that which will take you to the advanced Google search page. Here you’ll find a large array of search qualifiers which allow one to focus one’s search more precisely. One parameter I find very useful in some circumstances is “site or domain”. So if I’m looking for something I know has appeared in Naked Capitalism I simply put nakedcapitalism.com in that field. Another is “last update” which lets me focus my search on only new items. Using those two in combination will limit results to recent items from NC. Reply ↓ JoeK March 16, 2017 at 10:08 pm True, but why is “advanced search” buried like that in the first place? Actually, IIRC it used to be more visible/easier to access–for example, I like to ogle watches I can’t afford and my favorite site for doing so has the link right under the search field. Call me cynical but it appears google doesn’t want users to create search enquiries that will negatively impact their secondary raison d’être (I place making $$$ via advertising below data mining/privacy invasion/surveillance). Crapitalism is indeed crapifying the www; yes content producers need to make money, but the way it’s being solicited from readers these days makes many pages nearly unreadable. The “targeted” ads and content would be shameful if the codebots that created them had any shame (I infer they don’t). “(Insert famous person’s name)’s net worth will shock you!” “This flashlight’s availability to the public is giving generals the willies!” “(Insert city you’re visiting) wants to ban…..” We truly appear to have arrived at Lowest Common Denominator, a terminus.

Reply ↓ allan March 16, 2017 at 9:21 am Trump resets U.S.-Saudi relations, in Saudi Arabia’s favor [WaPo] President Trump’s new deal with Saudi Arabia is really good — for the Saudis. After publicly bashing the kingdom for years, Trump completely reversed course Tuesday and rolled out the red carpet for the Saudi royals. He gave them a huge publicity boost and a highly sought-after U.S. commitment to improve and elevate bilateral relations. And what did Trump get in return? Not much at all. … I’m old enough to remember when certain commenters claimed that Trump would disrupt, in a good way, our relationships with tyrannical regimes in the Middle East, while Clinton would be more of the same. How’s that working? … The Saudi leadership saw Hillary Clinton as more aligned with them on regional issues, but still worried that she would have insisted on Saudi political reform and respect for human rights, even conditioning U.S. military and financial support on progress on those fronts. But with the Trump administration, that’s no longer an issue. … Reply ↓ Pat March 16, 2017 at 9:33 am Gee, I remember Clinton making noises about those issues when she was in a position to approve arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Oh…wait… Other than reportage from about Saudi leadership about what they feared from Clinton based on unknown sources from a clearly anti-Trump pro-Clinton news source where again do we get any indication of these concerns. Oh..wait… Am I happy about this? No. Do I think for a moment anything would have been different if Clinton had been elected in this regard? Well, yes, I do. I’m sure the Clinton Foundation would still exist and there would have been a big donation to it in January from those self same Saudi leaders. So yes, Clinton would have gotten a better deal for Clinton. Reply ↓ allan March 16, 2017 at 9:42 am From WhiteHouse.gov: Readout of the President’s Meeting with Mohammed bin Salman Abdulaziz Al Saud, Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Yesterday at the White House, President Donald J. Trump and Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reaffirmed their support for a strong, broad, and enduring strategic partnership based on a shared interest and commitment to the stability and prosperity of the Middle East region. They directed their teams to explore additional steps across a broad range of political, military, security, economic, cultural, and social dimensions to further strengthen and elevate the United States-Saudi strategic relationship for the benefit of both countries. U.S. and Saudi officials intend to consult on additional steps to deepen commercial ties and promote investment, and to expand cooperation in the energy sector. The President and the Deputy Crown Prince noted the importance of confronting Iran’s destabilizing regional activities while continuing to evaluate and strictly enforce the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The President expressed his strong desire to achieve a comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to continue the two countries’ consultations to help reach solutions for regional issues. More broadly, the President and Deputy Crown Prince noted the ongoing security and military cooperation between the two countries in confronting Daesh/ISIS and other transnational terrorist organizations that pose a threat to all nations. The two countries announced their determination to strengthen their cooperation in the economic, commercial, investment, and energy fields, with the aim of realizing growth and prosperity in the two countries and the global economy. President Trump provided his support for developing a new United States-Saudi program, undertaken by joint U.S.-Saudi working groups, and its unique initiatives in energy, industry, infrastructure, and technology worth potentially more than $200 billion in direct and indirect investments within the next four years. The President also provided his support for United States investments in Saudi Arabia and the facilitation of bilateral trade, which will result in sizable opportunities for both countries. On energy, the two countries affirmed their desire to continue bilateral consultations in a way that enhances the growth of the global economy and limits supply disruption and market volatility. The two countries highlighted that expanded economic cooperation could create as many as one million direct American jobs within the next four years, millions of indirect American jobs, as well as jobs in Saudi Arabia. The Deputy Crown Prince reviewed Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 program for the President and agreed to put in place specific bilateral programs to help both countries benefit from new opportunities created by the Kingdom’s implementation of those new economic plans. [emphasis added] Dick Cheney couldn’t have said it any better. Compare and contrast with the campaign rhetoric quoted in the WaPo article I first linked to. But that was then and this is now. Reply ↓ Pat March 16, 2017 at 10:07 am Yes it is disappointing to end up exactly where we would have with President Clinton. Sorry it saved the Saudi’s a few million dollar ‘donation’ to the Clinton Foundation. Although either group having that money is disgusting. As for your bold facing, not just usual rhetoric it is business as usual with regards to the ‘energy’ business and our relationship with SA. I do find the limiting volatility thing amusing though. The current volatility is the race to cheap oil. See the failure of the OPEC agreement discussed here on NC just a couple of days ago. Neither country has a means of stopping that particular slide. Reply ↓ cocomaan March 16, 2017 at 10:51 am You could argue that Exxon is probably going to benefit, so the cash going to the Foundation is now just going to a corporation instead. The House of Saud are some of the most horrific people on the planet. Trump just capitulated to them in a massive middle finger to supporters who thought his tough talk on Islamic extremism would result in something meaningful. Reply ↓ Pat March 16, 2017 at 11:18 am Not sure Exxon is going to benefit, but yeah they might. And if there are any benefits to this it is to a small group of people largely in the energy sector. Since I think SA and Israel’s influence in our foreign policies and in our government as one of the top five problems facing this country, I am extremely disappointed that this was just another campaign ‘promise’, and we do get what we would have gotten without the ‘change’ candidate getting office. And yes, like the GOP plan for ACA replacement, it is a big screw you to his supporters (and even those of us who don’t support him). It is especially upsetting if you believe like I do that much of the religious extremism we see in the Middle East is being spread by SA and terrorism centered there is even supported by them. Although I also know that much of the terrorism only pretends to be about Islam it is about power, same as many perhaps even most evangelical Christian preachers and Christianity. Reply ↓ craazyboy March 16, 2017 at 12:41 pm I do recall Hillary was in favor of restarting the draft and making young girls eligible for the draft as well – making it all a merry “woke” thing with equal opportunity, equal pay and all those good things. The young servicewomen could end up shipped to Saudi, or the front lines of Yemen, or even lead the charge when we, the Saudis, and Israel inevitably decide to liberate Iran. I’m not sure this scenario has really ended with Hillary, but it’s something we can still hope for. What we really have here is the inability of the US to find a way to untie this Gordian Knot binding us together with the ME. In recent years, we have been trying to employ or partner with some nasty thugs to avoid having to put too many of our own boots on the ground. Limited pragmatic success so far, except for Russia at least temporarily making headway in Syria. ‘Course in that case, Russia beat up our thugs. And we could be on opposite sides when it comes time to liberate Iran. This is a labyrinth I can never find my way out of. Goblin Kings everywhere.

But the Trump administration wants to discourage people from choosing fuel efficient vehicles by lowering the CAFE (Corporate Average Fuels Economy) standards. This is short term thinking at its most extreme. There are many articles about this; here’s one: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-cafe-fuel-economy-standards-rollback/ Oh, why not. Here’s another: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-at-the-pump-car-companies-move-to-create-fuel-efficiency-double-standard/ Reducing fuel efficiency is a great way to provide more money for Middle Eastern terrorists and oppressive governments in the same region. I’m not sure why anyone would want to do that, but obviously that’s the policy of the Trump administration: pro-terror and pro-oppression. Reply ↓ cocomaan March 16, 2017 at 10:56 am Vatch, we need efficiency, but we’re not even close to thinking about it. We had a snowstorm up here in the NE this week and the number of people I know using snowblowers to do all their work is wild. These are people with legs, arms, and a back. They can damn well shovel but didn’t. They instead outsourced their efforts to sweet crude and oppressive resource extractors. My wife and I shoveled our way out and are now better in shape for the effort. The average person just does not need a snowblower, it’s ludicrous. Reply ↓ HotFlash March 16, 2017 at 11:52 am Yup, and it is not as if there are not people who could shovel snow for them. A. M. Smith’s heroine in the The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency series (set in Botswana) talks disapprovingly about a university professor who is well-compensated, but will not share his bounty with others, specifically, allows his house to be neglected rather than hire a housekeeper and a gardener. OTOH, I remember reading (here? FDL?) a comment by a woman whose husband, a college professor who was, um, indifferent to fashion, getting an offer from neighbour lady, “I’ll give you a sandwich for shovelling my walk.” On my street we have an unorganized snow shovelling coop. Whoever feels like/has the time to shovel does for the 6-7 or so houses on our block, plus we tend to do our across-the-street neighbours if we have time/energy, seniors and disabled first. Been going for 5 yrs or so, works great.

There was a very high number of people that voted, which is quite something to begin with. Next up is the “fact” that “far-right”/populist parties didn’t “win”. Actually, they did win: – PVV got +5 seats, not much, but still they’re the second largest party now – FvD (new party) got 2 seats – VVD and CDA took up some of the PVV’s talking points – Left as a whole lost, and the PvdA got clobbered – Most likely will be a combination of VVD-CDA-D66-CU, which is a center-right cabinet What I really don’t understand is that there’s no attention being given to DENK, which is a party aligned with the dictatorial regime in Turkey.

He doesn’t appear to lead a faction or to be a political bellwether his congressional colleagues pay attention to. Is he just a Senate pinion for the broad effort to legitimize neocon positions? He used to be portrayed as an independent, hands across the aisles guy capable of finding sensible common ground. But for some time now, as the ME and Russia have preoccupied him, he just seems to be a lone shouter. Does Ran Paul need to give a damn about what he says? Reply ↓ Uahsenaa March 16, 2017 at 12:01 pm He’s not just a lone shouter; Graham is just as noisy. Even if he were, he’s a lone shouter who chairs the Armed Services Committee, so he gets to dictate how oversight of the military plays out. And when generals and various IC functionaries appear before him, they kiss his ring, while he obediently calls for all the money to be given to the military. Why liberals keep propping him up as the voice of reason, when in reality he’s a frothing loony, is beyond me. Paul, on the other hand, is pretty marginalized within his own party, a back-bencher, to use parliamentary parlance. This doesn’t put him on the outside anymore than he already was.

All indications are that that delusion should be in shreds by May. And that more people should get they were being scammed by Obama and most of the Democratic leadership. All of it leading to populist demanded wholesale changes that would make the Third Way/New Democrats shake in their boots (think of it as the elected Democratic version of the Republican Tea Party panic on steroids). All working to stem the hemorrhage of this, and to start the long term care of our country’s ailing condition. Unfortunately, we are going to get the budget from hell, the Democratic leadership will still be making what should be obvious the dog ate my homework excuses, democratic voters remaining largely in denial buy it and nothing will change. Instead the Republicans will just keep piling the leeches on the failing body with no one stopping them and a few of the opposition even helping to pile them on.

Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner March 16, 2017 at 12:15 pm Older voters don’t typically vote GOP. These older republican voters were once younger republican voters. The 80’s were awash in stories about the youth revolution of the GOP which was largely driven by Democrats losing voters as the moved right. When the GOP noticed that young boom getting older and the New Deal generation (guess who they voted for) dying off, older voters became sharply more conservative. Pretty soon, email chains were everywhere (computer engineers and IT people are overwhelmingly republican) explaining the aging GOP voter as connected to wisdom gained with age. The Democrats winning all those young people in 2006 and 2008 and then proceeding to dump on them destroyed the opportunity to produce a new New Deal generation and permanent Democratic majority.

Income disparities have become so pronounced that America’s top 10 percent now average nearly nine times as much income as the bottom 90 percent. Americans in the top 1 percent tower stunningly higher. They average over 38 times more income than the bottom 90 percent. But that gap pales in comparison to the divide between the nation’s top 0.1 percent and everyone else. Americans at this lofty level are taking in over 184 times the income of the bottom 90 percent. ============================================================== Well…..just like fracking, the fact that there is less and less wealth to pump from the 90% does not mean that we have reached peak inequality…..

It resulted in Trump’s effective rate going from about 4% to about 24%. But there has been almost no reporting on this (or, to be fair, commentary from Democrats who in theory should be interested in pointing this out). And now this piece in the NYT, which goes on and on about how bad the AMT is, until grudgingly admitting, in the last paragraph, that for Trump in 2005 it functioned as intended. Inquiring minds want to know: Does the publisher of the NYT have to pay AMT? Mr. Sulzberger, release those returns! Reply ↓ jrs March 16, 2017 at 1:29 pm because it makes taxes way more complex as it’s two parallel tax systems. Progressive taxation is one thing, taxing capital gains at the same rate as income is one thing, getting rid of most deductions might also be a good idea. With all that, you’d have Trump paying more taxes I’d bet. But noone likes taxes that they have to spend days of unpaid labor trying to figure out and then still worry about. Taxes are a tax on time, at least when they are that complex. Funny I think they are probably far less a tax on time for those who actually ARE rich and can just hire the best tax accountants money can buy, than everyone else scratching their head at their tax software which is all they can afford. Reply ↓ allan March 16, 2017 at 2:03 pm I have been hit with the possibility of paying the AMT a couple of times (not recently) and, yes, it is a pain to have to calculate your return twice, in two very different ways. But taxes on time come in many forms – fighting with health insurance companies, long layovers at hubs because of our airline oligopoly, lines at understaffed banks – and many of them yield no benefit to me or society. I’m more than willing to spend time on a system that also forces rich people to pay their fair share. The NYT story said that in fact many wealthy are still able to avoid the AMT, but provided no figures, and you have to wonder whether the Gray Lady protesteth too much. Reply ↓ Chauncey Gardiner March 16, 2017 at 1:03 pm Thank you for the clarifying article from Fabius Maximus. I agree that the Fed is focused on wage pressures, and that they likely look at momentum in the KC Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Index as a key determinant of policy direction regarding interest rates. I believe their approach dates back to the Fed’s experience during the hyperinflation of the late-1970s and early 1980s, and the aggressive monetary policy actions that Volcker took at that time to suppress wages under the “Fed’s dual mandate” argument. I suspect they are averse to repeating that episode due to its adverse effect on stock and bond prices, and would rather preempt emergence of wage pressures and run the risk of erring on the other side. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FRBKCLMCIM I also suspect some other cross currents play an unstated but significant role, and that key Fed constituencies are now complaining of interest rate margin compression as potential trading gains have largely been realized from the long-term rise in the bond market which has run up against the zero bound in interest rates. However, I also believe the Fed has continued to underestimate the magnitude and duration of the damage to Labor stemming from the 2007-09 economic collapse which so impaired consumers debt servicing capacity. Further, the Urban Consumer Price Index is now running hotter than growth in Disposable Personal Income as the effects of debt leverage from QE-ZIRP in elevating real estate prices and other maladjustments are revealed in the real economy. Reply ↓ Editor of the Fabius Maximus website March 16, 2017 at 5:59 pm Chauncey, The Fed might heavily weight a Labor Market Conditions Index in their policy decisions. But which one? The KC Fed’s LMCI shows strong momentum. But the Fed’s LMCI has been slowing for 5 years, its growth rate peaking in January 2012. Its level has been flat since December 2015. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FRBLMCI https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2014/updating-the-labor-market-conditions-index-20141001.html You point to a second factor that Fed leaders seldom mention but which is rumored to be significant: the needs of Wall Street and the larger banking industry. They might want higher rates, and the Fed has a history of often giving banks what they want. Unfortunately, what the banks want and how the Fed weights that input are matters for guessing. No transparency! Reply ↓ Chauncey Gardiner March 16, 2017 at 8:16 pm Thanks for the links and your insightful observations.

That is where the money is. They are big consumers of the entitlement programs which are getting in the way of Making America Great Again. Its almost like those programs were designed to spend money on them. After all, When America Was Great, the average life expectancy was much lower than today and re-achieving that pinnacle of greatness should be an obvious economic goal to reduce federal budget deficits while providing for tax cuts to the wealthy. It was excellent that many of these seniors voted for Trump and the Freedom Congress and courageously putting themselves on the menu so that Trump and Congress can Make America Great Again. Self-sacrifice has always been a great American value that receives adulations from future generations.

Reply ↓ adrena March 16, 2017 at 10:23 pm Terrible article. Disagree completely. Commenter Freya Beth says it best: I have to say I am glad that the author has refrained from commenting about feminism until now as she has no idea what feminism means. The patronising use of the term “ladies” is a bad start and it just gets worse from there. Obviously, examples of exaggerated outrage-mongering are not hard to find in social media, from either the left or the right. To take a couple of extreme examples and then claim that the “feminist left” (whatever that is) is driving men to the extreme right of white supremacy, hansonism and misogyny is not only offensive but absurd. You couldn’t make this stuff up. Oh, except, you just did! It is not only bizarre, it is also victim blaming: men are misogynist because feminists are mean to them! You do know that is straight out the MRA handbook don’t you? This piece is really a denial of the entire concept of feminism itself. I’m not sure what the author thinks feminism is, but feminists at least agree on the premise that women are oppressed by virtue of being women. That this concept involves an oppressed and an oppressor is just too much for the author to accommodate. Speaking of exaggeration, the author makes liberal use of dishonest misrepresentations herself. Including a series of bizarre rhetorical questions which bear no relation to anything any feminist has ever thought or said: “Are you telling me I should dismiss my (male I assume?) partner’s hard work….?” Who?! What?!? Nope. You just made that up too. Reply ↓ flora March 16, 2017 at 11:52 pm oh gosh. I have a completely different take, having listened to self-described radical feminists 40 years ago discussing whether, in an all female commune, male children should be put up for adoption or killed outright, since males ipso facto were enemies. No kidding. I am not making this up. I thought they were nuts but they were dead serious, so to speak. I think the author of this article is saying don’t alienate your allies, and don’t assume your allies are id-pol agreed on groups or individuals. Reply ↓ flora March 16, 2017 at 11:57 pm I should add that no women who advocated killing male children actually had children, male or female. The women who did have children thought the discussion was crazy. They were accused of being insufficiently feminist. Oy. And no, no children were either threatened or harmed. But even having that discussion was so insane I still remember it, and wonder what planet some of the self described true-believers live on. Reply ↓ adrena March 17, 2017 at 12:38 am OMG!

Following the company’s refusal to accept responsivity for content. According to The Independent, banks have joined other multinational companies in the UK to pull ads from Google over hate preachers. The companies are said to be embittered over their ads appearing side-by-sides videos being posted by extremists like the Islamic State, ISIS on YouTube. Three of UK’s biggest banks including HSBC, Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) expressed fears that some of their budgets for ads are being used to fund banned hate preachers, extremists, terrorist organizations and racists among others. The bank’s decision is coming on the heels of other blue chip companies that have taken similar steps to pull ads from Google’s streaming website, YouTube. Other companies that have that have expressed their displeasure over Google’s nonchalant attitude towards the videos include, motor giant Audi, McDonald’s, L’Oreal, the BBC, The Guardian, Channel 4, and a couple of government agencies. Their action does not only end with ads on YouTube, but affects Google search as well. This development could significantly affect Google’s dominance of online ads as more companies are on the verge of taking similar step to express their displeasure. The Independent reports that Sky, Barclays and Vodafone are believed to be making plans to withdraw their ads as well. Unless Google changes its policy to please these heavyweights, its dominance is about to face its biggest tests in recent times. Urgent steps need to be taken by Google to win back the loyalty of the companies if it wants it doesn’t want to find itself in a situation where its profit will be highly affected. According to investigation carried out by The Times, loads of multinational companies have had their ads shown alongside YouTube videos posted by extremists. A case in point is a video posted by a former leader of the Klu Klux Klan, David Duke. Other hate preachers have also been receiving payouts from Google, and the companies feel they have been directly or indirectly funding such groups. Ads funded by tax payers have also been appearing alongside hate videos; and this continues to anger a lot of people, organizations and government departments. Google’s refusal to accept responsibility for content being posted on its platform is a big issue. The company insists it cannot be categorized as a media organization, which makes it difficult to be regulated same way media companies are being controlled. Speaking to Business Insider on why it is important for Google alongside Facebook should admit they are media organizations, Sir Martin Sorrell, head of global ad agency WPP said: “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company,” Mr Sorrell said, per The Independent.  “They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements.” Got something to add to this story?

PublishedMar 20, 2017, 5:00 am SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/47Wn Copy LONDON • Google has announced changes to its advertising policies after major brands pulled advertisements from the platform because they appeared alongside offensive content, such as videos promoting terrorism or anti-Semitism. The US company said in a blog post last Friday that it would give clients more control over where their ads appear on YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites. The announcement came after the British government and The Guardian newspaper pulled advertisements from the video site, stepping up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform. France's Havas, the world's sixth-largest advertising and marketing company, also pulled its British clients' ads from Google and YouTube last Friday after failing to get assurances from Google that the ads would not appear next to offensive material. Those clients include government-owned BBC, Domino's Pizza and Hyundai Kia, Havas said. "Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network's ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect," said Mr Paul Frampton, chief executive officer and country manager for Havas Media Group UK. Google made US$7.8 billion (S$11 billion) in advertising revenue in Britain last year, accounting for 8.6 per cent of the company's total sales. Later, the parent company Havas said it would not take any action outside Britain, and called its British unit's decision "a temporary move". The decision to pull advertisements from Google followed a Times of London investigation that revealed ads from many large companies and the British government appeared alongside content from the likes of American white nationalist David Duke and pastor Steven Anderson, who had praised the killing of 49 people in an Orlando gay nightclub in June last year. Google made US$7.8 billion (S$11 billion) in advertising revenue in Britain last year, accounting for 8.6 per cent of the company's total sales. The boycott signals a growing backlash against so-called programmatic trading, which automates the buying and selling of advertising online, and social media providers that are seen to not be doing enough to tackle hate disseminated on their platforms. Media-buying firms are also increasingly resentful of the power wielded by Google and Facebook, claiming that the two companies operate a global duopoly over online advertising. Mr Ronan Harris, Google's United Kingdom managing director, said in the blog post that the company removed nearly two billion offensive ads from its platforms last year and also blacklisted 100,000 publishers from its ad sense programme. The company will now review its policies and said it would be making changes "in the coming weeks" to help customers stop their ads from appearing on objectionable websites or against offensive videos, Mr Harris said.

The company also uses hiring panels, including many of its employees, to interview applicants.PHOTO: THE UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG PublishedMar 20, 2017, 5:00 am SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Purchase Article Permalink: http://str.sg/47PQ Copy In the third of a four-part series on the future of work, Google's vice-president for staffing and operations Sunil Chandra talks about what employers look for when scouting for the best talents from around the world. Sandra Davie Senior Education Correspondent sandra@sph.com.sg Singaporean Muhammad Mohsin admits to being awed by the work environment and staff perks provided by his employer Google, when he started work as a software engineer at Mountain View, California, four years ago. Who wouldn't - with perks like stock options, massage rooms, nap pods, laundry services and hairdressers, and mechanics for your car on site? If you didn't have a car, there were commuting shuttles with Wi-Fi on board. The numerous restaurants, cafes, juice bars, microkitchens and pantries appear to confirm the rumoured "150-feet rule" that stipulates no "Googler" should be farther than this distance from a food outlet. He has also received and awarded "peer bonuses", where Googlers can arrange for the company to pay surprise bonuses - to show appreciation to a colleague who went beyond the call of duty. BIO Mr Sunil Chandra, vice-president of staffing and operations at Google, leads the team responsible for all of Google's hiring, outreach programmes and operations. The team is responsible for finding the best talents for Google - from university campuses through to experienced candidates with deep domain expertise. The operations teams are responsible for making sure that Google's people processes run like clockwork across all offices and teams. The business intelligence and reporting teams bring the data that informs recruitment and staff development. Prior to joining Google, Mr Chandra was the chief operating officer for technology at Barclays Capital, where he helped build the global services group in Singapore, and director of administration at McKinsey & Co. He has a computer engineering degree from the University of Wollongong and an MBA from the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers, Australia. But what drew the Singapore Management University (SMU) graduate to Google, and still excites him, goes beyond perks. "You get to work with really smart, driven people. And despite being so smart, they are always ready to help - what we call 'Googleyness'. "Plus, and this is a big plus - you get to do really interesting work," says the 34-year-old, who set up two start-ups developing phone applications after graduating from SMU with an information systems management degree. He had tried for a job at Google as a fresh graduate, but got a call only three years later after Google saw a mobile game he had developed and put online. He is a member of the team working on G Board, the keyboard that lets users search and send information, GIFs, emojis and more, as they type. The office culture and impressive staff perks helped Google nab the top spot in Fortune's annual list of the 100 best companies to work for - again - just two weeks ago. The company, which employs 72,000 people worldwide, including 1,000 in Singapore, has been named the top workplace for the sixth straight year. It's the eighth time in 11 years that Google has topped the list. So, how does one land a job with the world's best employer? Will top grades and a degree from a top university help one stand out from the two million to three million who apply for a job at Google every year? Google's vice-president for staffing and operations Sunil Chandra gives a firm "No". He says Google has used data analytics for years to figure out how to hire people with the right fit. "There is no correlation between our good hires and the universities that they come from or their GPAs," says the Australian-trained engineer, quickly adding that he is not encouraging anyone aiming for a job at Google to drop out of college. He explains further: "Just because you did well in university, it does not mean that you are intellectually curious and you have skills and passion to produce great products, which is what Google is looking for." What about the impossibly difficult and punishing brain teasers that Google is famous for? The company once plastered a maths equation on a billboard that read: “{first 10-digit prime found in consecutive digits e}.com.”  Other teasers include:“How many aeroplanes are in the sky right now?” and “How many golf balls would fit inside a 747?”  According to Mr Chandra, teasers are a waste of time. “If you are an interviewer, they are a fun thing to ask. But there is actually no correlation to the hiring outcome.”  He goes on to what it is that Google looks for. Ability is important, though it is not academic ability that the company looks for, but problem-solving ability.  He explains: “The problems and the context will keep changing, but what Google looks for is the right attitude and ability to decode problems and solve them.”  The second thing that the hirers look for is role-related – essentially, whether you have the skills required to do the job. “So if you’re an engineer, can you code? If you are aiming for a sales position, can you come up with some effective sales strategies?” Third is leadership. Mr Chandra explains: “If you are a more senior person,we want to know if you have created great teams. If you are just starting off in your career, are you the kind of person who finds a problem and says, ‘I’m going to solve it.’ “So you could be in school or university and you say, ‘you know what, I don’t know why these cords are always hanging loose, I’m going to clean them up myself.’ “That’s taking charge and leading. “It’s a natural desire to want to make a difference and to be able to inspire other folk to come along with you. It’s innate leadership versus leadership that is granted because this is your position.” He stresses that this quality is important,because the tech giant wants its employees “to look at things we do, the way we do them and tell us how we can do it better”.  The final thing is the “Googleyness” that Mr Muhammad referred to – a combination of passion and drive and being a good team player. To find this, Mr Chandra says they look for people who work well in teams and have innate curiosity.  “Are you someone who just wants to know more about stuff? You have to be very curious about what else is possible, knowing that everything will change.” Google used to conduct many interviews before deciding on a person, but through analytics, the company has determined that after four interviews, they do not achieve a much greater degree of confidence about whether the interviewee is a good fit for a position. As a result, they have capped the number of interviews that they will put a candidate through. He also reveals that Google uses hiring panels, including many of its employees, to interview applicants. To date, Mr Muhammad has been part of more than 100 interview panels. “Hiring is pretty much part of everyone’s job,” says Mr Chandra. He also highlights the importance of diversity. “We have done multiple studies that show us that we build better products by having teams that come from different backgrounds with different perspectives.  “It makes sense as our users come from a wide variety of backgrounds and if we don’t represent our users, there’s no way for us to build great products.” Any advice for young people aspiring to work for great companies like Google? They must use their time in university well, he says.  “Discover who you are,what you’re excited about. Don’t focus on just one thing for the three or four years and do stuff. If you’re really fascinated by computers, write some code, build an app. If you’re really excited by cooking, go to cooking classes. If you really want to help others, join a volunteer organisation,because employers are interested in the whole person, not just in your degree.” He admits that Google uses an inordinate amount of resources and people in recruiting and developing the right talents. He says one great employee is worth a lot to the company. “We are in an age where a single person with a huge amount of passion and skills can go create apps and products that are used by billions of people. “That is the kind of person that all employers, including Google, look for – one with the right skills, talent and drive. “It’s good to go to university to gain knowledge, but what counts at the end of the day is what you can do with what you know.” A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on March 20, 2017, with the headline 'How to land a job in Google'.

Of all the DMCA requests copyright holders sent, roughly 40% were rejected due to inaccuracies or abuse. Most interesting, perhaps, is that Google processes more Wordpress.com takedowns than WordPress itself. Automattic, the company behind the popular WordPress.com blogging platform, receives thousands of takedown requests from rightsholders. A few days ago the company published its latest transparency report, showing that they processed 5,006 requests during the second half of last year. While this is a significant amount, it pales in comparison to many other user-generated services. Google, for example, receives the same number in less than four minutes. What’s also different is the high rejection rate WordPress has. More than 40% of all DMCA takedown notices are rejected due to inaccuracies or abuse, more than many other service providers. Overall, however, both the number of takedown requests and the removal rate are relatively stable. As can be seen below, Automattic generally removes content for just over half of the notices it receives; the rest are rejected. When we took a closer look at the takedown numbers, comparing them to Google’s data, something else stood out. It appears that Google receives more takedown requests for WordPress.com than Automattic, the company that operates the blogging platform. Over the past 12 months, copyright holders asked Google to remove over 13,100 WordPress.com URLs, while Automattic received less than 10,000 last year. In other words, copyright holders are more keen to remove the search engine results than the actual content, which is not very logical. TorrentFreak contacted Steve from Automattic, who says that the numbers suggest that rightsholders prefer to go through Google because this is the easier path. “Those numbers aren’t entirely surprising for a few reasons. When looking to limit access to material online, complainants will naturally look for the path of least resistance,” Steve says. “Since we manually scrutinize every single DMCA takedown notice that we receive for formal validity and fair use considerations, removal is not guaranteed, and we reject about 40% of all notices for being deficient in some way,” he adds. The Google takedown process is highly automated which makes it relatively easy for copyright holders to target a high volume of URLs, including those of WordPress.com. “Removing sites from top search engines is often much easier due to the automatic nature of the review process… something that is made even easier still by the various trusted partnership programs, and use of bulk electronic takedown notices,” Steve notes. Still, it’s a strange situation. If a copyright holder is really concerned about infringing content on WordPress.com, it should be at least worth a shot to ask the company to remove it. But no, of the top ten reporting organizations that asked Google to remove WordPress URLs, none appears in Automattic’s most recent top ten. Finally, it appears that the thousands of notices that are sent to the search engine are pretty much useless anyway. It may be easier than reaching out to Automattic, but not very effective since Google appears to have whitelisted the blogging platform. Of the 13,100 takedown requests Google processed over the past 12 months, only 0.3% were ultimately removed.

Name: Subject: Message: 10 best Google Daydream apps Apps & Gamesby Joe Hindy1 day ago 5 265 14 Google Daydream is Google’s newest VR platform. It’s only been around for a few months and only a few devices can use it. You’ll have a better experience than you would with Google Cardboard. However, we’re still waiting for the app market to populate more. It’s still early, but some apps are already pretty decent. Here are the best Google Daydream apps! Got Cardboard? Here are the best VR apps and games!   15 best VR games for Google Cardboard7 days ago   10 best VR apps for Google Cardboard7 days ago Coloring VR Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Coloring VR is one of the more relaxing Daydream apps. Like most coloring book apps, you'll be able to pick one of a variety of images and then color them in. It's not overly complex but it makes up for it by doing what it can do pretty well. You can look around, zoom in and out, and, of course, color stuff. That's about all that it does. It's completely free to download for now. It has enough code to show that it has in-app purchases, but it doesn't actually have any yet. It's worth a shot at least! DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Fulldive VR Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Fulldive does a lot of things for a VR app. It bills itself is a VR social platform that introduces you to all kinds of other VR content. That's all good and everything, but that's not what makes it one of the must try Daydream apps. It has the capacity to stream 360, 3D, and other VR content from YouTube. You can also play your locally stored VR videos and photos. Perhaps its best feature is the ability to browse for other VR apps and games. Not all of them will have Daydream support, but it's a good place to start. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Google Photos Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY As it turns out, Google Photos is actually also a Google Daydream app. On your device, it's a great app to backup photos and videos. On Daydream, it's a good place to view all of that stuff. It has support for 360-degree photos, panoramas (of a certain size), and VR photos. It's a free app that most people should have on their smartphones anyway. Thus, it makes sense to pick it up for use for Daydream. It's completely free to download and use. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY NBA VR and NFL VR Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Both the NBA and the NFL have both released Daydream apps. Unfortunately, they're not fully featured apps. At least not yet. The NBA app gives you access to a lot of tertiary content. You'll be able to watch highlights, exclusive interviews, and stuff like that. The NFL VR app does essentially the same thing. Both are very fun VR experiences. However, we look forward to the day when you can stream live games. Until then, though, fans of (American) football or basketball should mostly enjoy these experiences. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Netflix VR, Hulu, HBO GO Price: Free (with subscriptions) DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY One of the first industries to pick up on VR was video streaming. They're still working on the experience end of it, but the apps work fairly well. You'll be able to binge stuff like you always do from the comfort of a VR living room. Hulu rolled their VR approach into the official app while Netflix and HBO GO have separate VR apps that you'll need to search for. They all still require the same old subscriptions which helps keep things simple. They're not flawless experiences by any means, but it's one of the funner ways to use VR right now. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY How about a little augmented reality?   10 best augmented reality games and AR games for Android2 weeks ago   10 best augmented reality apps and AR apps for Android2 weeks ago myVR Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY myVR is a personalization app. It's also a fun way to experience VR. You'll be given your own personal space that you can customize. It also lets you add sources such as YouTube channels, websites, music sources, and other stuff. That way you can stay up on news, videos, and music that you like. Additionally, you can visit other people and view their little spaces if you want to. It's nothing too amazing, but it's a fun way to experience VR. It's definitely one of the must-try Daydream apps. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY RaveVR Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY RaveVR is a video platform that helps you find VR video content. It connects to a variety of websites such as YouTube, Reddit, Vimeo, and Viki. You'll be able to search through and watch some VR stuff as it comes out. It also has a text and voice chat built-in that lets you connect with other people, watch videos together, and chit chat. The only downside is that you'll need to log in using your Facebook account. Some won't like that and we don't blame them. However, if you don't mind, then it's a fun little thing to experience. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Skybox VR Player Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Skybox VR Player is a video player for Daydream. It has surprisingly good support for most types of video. That includes 2D, 3D, 180-degree, and 360-degree video content. You can install a PC component and stream your own video content from your computer to your headset if you so choose. It's a solid, enjoyable experience. Especially if you have a collection of VR content on your own. It's free to download if you want to try it out. It's one of the must-get Daydream apps. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Splash VR for Reddit Price: $2.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Splash VR for Reddit is, as you can imagine, a VR Reddit app. It allows you to look up your favorite subreddits, scroll through them, and view content. It features an infinite scroll, zooming in on images, theming, and other small customization features. There is even Gifv support, filters (so you can avoid NSFW or even politics if you want to), and you can open YouTube videos in its official app. It's not half bad. There isn't a free version to check out, so you'll have to buy the app and test it inside of its refund time to see if you like it. The developer also has a VR app for Imgur called IMVR. It works well with this app. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY YouTube VR Price: Free / $9.99 per month DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY YouTube VR is definitely one of the must-have Daydream apps. It's a no-brainer, really. YouTube had some of the first VR videos ever and the collection has only grown exponentially since then. You can find all kinds of VR content here, from demo footage to show your friends to stuff you might actually like. You can still watch regular videos as well in a VR setting. It has some bugs here and there that still need to get worked out. However, it's for sure going to be a staple in the Daydream apps staple forever, probably.

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > Waymo looks to protect tech secrets from Uber in… Waymo looks to protect tech secrets from Uber in lawsuit over stolen tech secrets By Bill Roberson — March 17, 2017 1:34 PM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: There’s no fighting in the war room Happy St. Pat’s, and as Google/Alphabet’s Waymo autonomous car division squares off with Uber in lawsuit over stolen trade secrets, Alphabet officials are concerned that Uber’s lawyers, while viewing court documents, could potentially have access to even more Waymo trade secrets. The lawsuit began after Waymo hauled Uber into court, claiming a former employee left the company for Uber after downloading a lot of Waymo’s self-driving tech secrets. Nine months later, Uber had their own self-driving car effort up and running with some tech that they say looked awfully familiar to Waymo’s, and Google released the lawyers. As part of the legal process, Waymo has to tell Uber what they’re up against, and that includes documents with even more technical data on Waymo’s efforts. Waymo is trying to work some legal deals to keep their secrets secret, and Uber says that they haven’t seen any “sensitive” Waymo tech documents yet, so we’d say this whole legal drama clearly has a long, long way to go. Vista is about to get harder to see Still using Windows Vista? OK, hey, whatever works. But the problem is, Vista isn’t going to work for much longer, at least not very well, and neither will Windows 7, depending on what kind of computer you’re using. Vista is essentially going to the data heaven on April 11th, when Microsoft will terminate all support for the OS. That could leave openings for hackers and data thieves as they pry for weaknesses in the OS. Meanwhile, Microsoft is now sending prompts to users of Windows 7, letting them know whatever machine they’re using is now “unsupported hardware” – which, ironically, are new PCs, instead of old ones – and no further updates are forthcoming for them, either. Naturally, Redmond would love it if you would take the time to update to Windows 10, and they did give a heads up about this last year, so this is more of a reminder than surprise. Go here for more details on Vista and here Windows 7/8 issues. There are details in the dark We talked recently about how High Dynamic Range picture quality, also known as “HDR”, is coming to everything from TVs to computer monitors to smartphones, and now, graphics card maker Nvidia has released a behind-the-scenes 4K HDR video ahead of the release of the rebooted Mass Effect: Andromeda video game. Got a 4K TV or monitor? Then shut off the lights and check this video out. What can we say, it looks amazing. HDR technology gives video content better color, deeper blacks, more contrast and more detail than ever, and we even have a primer on why it’s the hot video tech of the moment, so check the link to learn more. Meanwhile, Mass Effect Andromeda comes out next week. We’ve got more news on our Facebook page and YouTube channel, and be sure to tune in to this week’s DT podcasts: Close to the Metal (computers and such) on Tuesday, Trends with Benefits (general tech shenanigans)  on Thursdays, and Between the Streams (movie and TV topics) every Friday.

It’s also LG’s follow-up to the G5, a phone that similarly attempted to redefine smartphones with its modular construction, but didn’t manage to do so. The G6 isn’t as bold or as risky as the G5, so has LG played it too safe this time? We’ve been using the phone for a week or so, and have plenty to say about it. Making the phablet manageable Many people struggle to believe the G6 has a 5.7-inch screen, because it feels so small in your hand. It’s easy to stretch your thumb across to the other side of the phone when holding it in one hand, and it remains usable at all times. Try that with any phone with a 5.5-inch screen, and it’s a struggle. More: LG G6 video teardown, and safety testing lab tour How has LG achieved this feat? It minimized the size of the bezels and chose an 18:9 aspect ratio, making it longer and thinner than the 16:9 aspect ratio screens found on most other phones. Get used to the look, as the G6 almost certainly won’t be the only 18:9 ratio phone we’ll see in 2017. The front of the G6 looks very modern, thanks to the rounded corners of the screen. It’s the screen that’s rounded, too, rather than a bezel over the top to give it the look. Combined with the rounded corners of the phone, it helps absorb impacts and lessens the likelihood of catastrophic screen damage. The thin top and bottom bezels make the screen stand out even more, and enhance the minimalist style of the phone. This is a glass and metal phone, with Gorilla Glass 3 on the front, and Gorilla Glass 5 on the back. We are worried that it will break and be expensive to replace, so we highly recommend you buy a G6 case. Flip it over, and the rear has LG’s trademark fingerprint sensor which doubles as a power button below the dual-lens camera and flash unit. Apart from a subtle G6 logo, that’s it. Our review model is platinum, which looks fantastic, and isn’t the fingerprint magnet you may expect. The phone also comes in black or white. The G6 is thicker than many phones, but not by much, and it gives you a lot more phone to hold on to. More: Keep your shiny new LG G6 safe from damage with the best cases and covers Is the G6 the perfect size and shape for a smartphone? At the moment, yes it is. It combines everything we love about big-screen phones and removes everything we hate about them. There’s no longer a reason to compromise and buy a smaller phone, and no reason to get one bigger than the G6, either. You won’t be prying the G6 out of our hands for a while. There’s a new screen shape in town Measuring 5.7 inches and boasting an impressive 2,880 × 1,440-pixel resolution, the G6 has envious screen specs; but those cool rounded edges and the overall size of the G6’s screen isn’t what makes it so special. It’s the 18:9 aspect ratio. This also equates to a 2:1 ratio, which means two perfect squares fit next to each other on it, something that LG exploits in the user interface. Why should you care about the aspect ratio? Isn’t that sort of thing just for cine-geeks? It’s actually the movie industry that may end up making-or-breaking the 18:9 screen. Some filmmakers consider it to be the happy medium between cinema and TV aspect ratios, meaning regardless of what screen a video is watched on, it will retain the same look — no cropping to fit — and stay the same as the director and cinematographer intended. More and more video is being watched on smartphones, so this is a major consideration. The LG G6 is the phablet’s worst nightmare. For now, there’s a limited amount of 18:9 content online, mostly streamed through Netflix. We watched Daredevil and Marco Polo on the G6, and both looked superb; filling the screen entirely after tapping a special button in a drop-down menu. There’s something very special about seeing a video fill the screen this way. It’s more immersive, more cinematic, and genuinely impactful. The aspect ratio isn’t the only feature that makes the video experience on the G6 special. It’s the first phone to come with both Dolby Vision and HDR 10 support. This technology previously only seen on televisions is designed to make the image more lifelike with better colors, more accurate contrast levels, and wider viewing angles. There’s not much content out there that takes advantage of it at the moment — it doesn’t make any difference to regular YouTube videos, or the operating system — so it’s only Netflix or Amazon Prime subscribers that may see the benefit. There’s also the problem with video content that’s not formatted for an 18:9 screen. That content has black bars running down the sides of the video in landscape orientation. If 18:9 video catches on like LG and others hope, this will eventually become less of a problem, but for now, you’ll have to put up with them in most cases. Size oddities aside, the G6’s display is stunning. It’s full of color, detail, and warmth, and a true pleasure to watch. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Although the screen is technically 5.7 inches in size, it doesn’t really look like any other 5.7-inch screen, and some may see the G6’s screen size as a con, due to the taller, thinner aspect ratio. For example, put the G6 alongside the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus and open an app such as Twitter, and the iPhone will display more text and information on one screen than the G6. It’s still a big-screen experience, just unlike those we’re used to. Slick software and fun apps Android 7.0 Nougat is installed on the LG G6, and our pre-production review model had the March 2017 security patch installed, making it right up to date. LG’s user interface is placed over Android and has a few additions to make better use of the 18:9 aspect ratio screen. Android purists will note changes to the notification shade, the Settings menu, and the option to enable the app tray, or spread apps across multiple home screens. LG also provides various themes to match the color scheme of your G6, which change backgrounds, wallpapers, and icons. The G6 is ideally suited to multi-window app use, providing a perfect square for two apps to live in, and it’s easy to activate using a long press of the Android menu key. LG only installs a few of its own apps, such as QuickMemo+, which handily syncs with Google Drive, LG Health, a Tasks app, and its own messaging, music, file manager, and calendar apps. Additionally, there’s an FM radio app, and an audio recorder. Many of LG’s own apps make use of the 18:9 aspect ratio. The Gallery app takes up the whole screen, for example. It’s LG’s Square Camera that’s the most interesting. It splits the screen into two, with the top half for square format pictures and the lower half for previews, or custom shots. It’s a shame Square Camera’s functionality wasn’t built into the main camera app, because many people will miss it. Grid Shot works especially well. The square is broken down into quarters, each filled with a still image or a three-second video clip, which when put together tells a neat little story. There’s plenty of room for creativity here, and best of all, the result can easily be shared on Facebook or Twitter, with videos intact. This is essential, and a problem Apple hasn’t overcome with its similarly fun Live Photos feature. If you can’t share them with your friends, we question whether it’s worth it at all. Other features in Square Camera include Match Shot, which is like Grid Shot but with two pictures instead of four, and Guide Shot for matching photos using a handy transparent overlay, so people can capture the same pose or composition on multiple occasions. A long press on the home button brings up Google Assistant. The G6 is the first to use the Assistant outside of the Pixel phones, ahead of its wider release on other Android 7.0 Nougat phones. We’ve reviewed a version of the G6 that has software which is 95 percent ready for release, meaning there may be some alterations when the phone goes on sale. However, we experienced no stability or compatibility problems. More: Feel fly like a G6 with these handy tips and tricks While LG’s user interface does deviate from standard Android, it’s not unpleasant or slow. Thought and effort has been put into the icon design when you change themes, the color choices that match the body, and the icon curves that match the shape of the screen. LG’s UX 6.0 looks fantastic, and we never felt a desire to change the launcher on the G6. The G6 has up-to-date software now, and we hope that will continue in the future, but that will be down to LG’s update schedule, which unfortunately may lag behind Google’s. A wonderful wide-angle camera There are two camera lenses on the back of the G6, both with 13 megapixels. One boasts a wider-angle lens than the other. The 125-degree wide-angle lens doesn’t have optical image stabilization and it has an f/2.4 aperture, while the 71-degree standard lens has OIS and a far better f/1.8 aperture. You get two different experiences when taking pictures, especially in low light, when the standard angle lens produces pictures with more detail and less noise. However, the G6 can take some fantastic nighttime or evening shots, adding drama and atmosphere in the right environment. Used creatively, and with the right lighting, the wide-angle lens is also more than capable. LG’s UX 6.0 looks fantastic, and we never felt a desire to change the launcher. In daylight, the G6’s camera didn’t enjoy overcast days at the end of British winter time, and struggled to manage contrast — eventually settling on washing out the sky and darkening the landscape. It’s not ideal, and something we’re hoping will be cured when the final software build is released. We also found the screen itself didn’t do the photo justice, and it often ended up looking better than expected when we checked the gallery. Again, something that’s likely to change with a software update. We’re noting it here in case nothing changes. Show the camera a blue sky, colorful plants, or any close-up material, and it shines. Using the phone in Spain after the launch, we compared the G6 to several other phones including the Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus, and found it produced the best image in several different tests. Most of the time, it came very close to matching the Pixel XL, a highly rated camera phone. Taking photos with the G6 is enjoyable and addictive, and the wide-angle mode presents new creative opportunities. There’s a manual mode for both stills and video, if you’re confident enough to change settings in search of the perfect picture. LG hasn’t included an editor, though, and you’re given the choice of using Google Photos or a third-party app, such as Snapseed instead. The G6’s selfie camera has 5 megapixels and a single 100-degree, wide-angle lens, and like the main camera the two modes are alternated using a button on the screen. There are also several filters to apply, and a chance to manipulate skin tone and artificial lighting sources. While capable enough, selfies taken with the G6 can’t match those of the Huawei P10. The wide-angle lens makes it easy to take great group shots, though, and goes along way to redeeming the front cam’s ability. LG has also made good use of the extra screen in the camera app, using the top edge (or side edge in landscape) as a preview gallery, showing the last four pictures taken so you don’t have to jump into the gallery app to see them. Plenty of power and battery life The LG G6 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor inside, plus 4GB of RAM. There will be those who mumble complaints about the Snapdragon 821, whining it’s not a super-new Snapdragon 835. Don’t be one of these people. Ever used the OnePlus 3T or a Google Pixel? There’s more than enough power inside both those phones to keep them fresh for ages, and they both have the 821 inside. LG made the decision to use the 821 in order to get the phone on sale quickly, rather than over the summer, and it shouldn’t put you off at all. An AnTuTu benchmark result returned a score of 135,032, and 3DMark’s Slingshot Extreme test saw it score 2,102. These are around the same as the scores attained by the Pixel XL, but fall short of the OnePlus 3T. It’s also very close to the LG G5 and the Samsung Galaxy S7. LG G6 Compared To Meizu Pro 6 Plus Xiaomi Mi5S Plus Xiaomi Mi Mix Huawei Mate 9 ASUS Zenfone 3 Deluxe Special… HTC Bolt Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Motorola Droid Turbo 2 Huawei Nexus 6P LG V10 Motorola Moto X Style Pure Edition Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Other complaints will be made about the lack of removable battery on the G6. However, even though the G6 is now a sealed phone, that has given it an IP68 water and dust resistance rating. While having a replaceable battery is great, having to replace the entire phone after you spill a drink all over it isn’t so great. Yes, you’re trading one feature for another, but additional durability protects your purchase instantly, and there are plenty of battery packs out there to buy. When we first started using the G6, the battery life was poor, barely lasting a mid-to-heavy use day. A software update has improved the situation, where we’re seeing 25 percent of the battery remaining after the same level of use in a single day. That includes photo work, social networking, games, and navigation. Buying the G6 in the U.S. will see your phone come with wireless charging, a feature not included on international versions of the phone. Using the supplied charger and USB Type-C cable charged the 3,200mAh cell reach capacity after about an hour and 30 minutes. No Hi-Fi audio for most buyers and not enough storage Watching stunning video is what the G6 is made for, so how about the audio experience? Sadly, it falls short of the video performance. It doesn’t have stereo speakers, just a single one at the base of the phone, and there’s no Dolby Atmos, or even standard Dolby Audio tweaks. The single speaker does a decent job, but it’s overshadowed by the iPhone 7 Plus, Boomsound speakers on any HTC phone, and cheaper hardware like the ZTE Axon 7 and 7 Mini. It’s a shame, when what’s on screen looks so fantastic. The wide-angle mode presents new creative opportunities. Additionally, LG has restricted the Quad DAC to devices for sale in South Korea only. LG G6 phones sold in the United states get 32GB of internal storage and a MicroSD card slot as part of the SIM tray, but internationally, larger capacity versions will be sold. LG G6 phones in Europe have neither the Quad DAC or wireless charging. We’d much rather a single model with all these features inside. LG says the localization is based on buyer preferences, and ensures the price of the phone is kept competitive in different regions. Price, availability, and warranty LG hasn’t announced a price for the G6, but carrier partners are slowly revealing their own. Verizon will sell the G6 for $672 from March 17, with release on March 30. We expect it to be widely available elsewhere over the coming weeks. LG traditionally gives you a one-year warranty on smartphones, which covers either repair or replacement, plus any labor charges. You’ll have to send it back to LG if it goes wrong, though. Our Take Thanks to the LG G6, having a big, beautiful screen doesn’t mean enduring an oversize phone anymore, and it’s wonderful. Is there a better alternative? No. As of the time of writing, the LG G6 is the best Android phone you can currently buy. That may change once Samsung has had it’s say, but only time will tell. Based on the early price from Verizon, the G6 will cost less than $700, and around the same $650 price point as the G5. This is excellent news, especially as we’re hearing the Galaxy S8 — the G6’s natural challenger — will be up to $850. The Google Pixel XL is the obvious alternative for stock Android fans who dislike any customization. It costs $750, has a Snapdragon 821 processor, Android Nougat and Google Assistant, plus a highly capable camera. What it doesn’t have is the G6’s sleek body and gorgeous new screen, or a wide-angle camera lens. No other phone offers this combination, and although the Galaxy S8 is likely to have an 18:9 aspect ratio screen, it almost certainly won’t have the wide-angle camera. The DT Accessory Pack Olloclip Pivot $50 LG wireless headset $70 Motorola Moto 360 Sport $130 The OnePlus 3T is a strong alternative to the G6 if you want to save a lot of money. It also has a Snapdragon 821 processor, plus 6GB of RAM, and a considerably lower $440 price tag. There aren’t any camera bells and whistles, but it still takes solid shots. Finally, LG’s own V20 may be considered. It has the same size screen, similar wide-angle camera setup, a degree of durability, and the removable battery. It’s wildly expensive, though. How long will it last? LG’s G6 should have a long shelf life of at least two-to-three years. The software is right up to date, and it has Google Assistant already installed, meaning there’s no need to wait for an update. Updates in the future may take longer to arrive than on a Pixel phone, though. That’s our only concern and reservation in recommending the G6 over the Pixel XL. The processor is the only sticking point. We always like to have the latest hardware and software, because it ensures the phone will last many years if we want it to, but the Snapdragon 821 won’t remain Qualcomm’s top chip for much longer. Does it matter? Not really. It won’t suddenly stop working, and your phone won’t suddenly react like it’s pedal-powered. However, if bragging rights are your thing, it’ll soon lose out to the Snapdragon 835. That said, the 821 is tried and tested, unlike the 835. Should you buy it? Yes. The G6 is not only the first major flagship smartphone out in 2017 that we really adore, but it’s also a return to what makes us love LG phones — subtle yet beautiful design, a brilliant standout feature, and a cracking camera. The software is good, too, with Google Assistant installed rather than a third-party or untested alternative, ensuring it works cohesively throughout the phone. Best of all, it’s compact and easy to use with one hand, but offers a screen larger than its direct competitors. We love it, and think you will to.

Safari Thorin Klosowski Mar 20, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple browsers chrome downloads ios 10 ipad iphone safari Share Safari has long been the go-to browser on the iPhone, but after Apple finally opened up the secret speed enhancements in Safari to other browsers way back in iOS 8, it's now possible to ditch Safari entirely for another browser. Chrome is the most obvious choice for doing so. But is it worth it? The Contenders You have a number of browser options on iOS, but most of them, like the privacy-focused Brave, the gesture-based Dolphin, or the speed-centric Opera Mini, all fill a niche instead of trying to be your daily driver. For that, Chrome and Safari lead the pack. Here's a quick summary of their feature-set: Safari: Safari is the default browser we've all come to know so well over the years. It does everything a browser needs to do, including offering up a private browsing mode, bookmarks, and as of iOS 9, ad blocking. Safari is deeply integrated into iOS, which means you can search for something in Spotlight and open it in Safari, and by default most apps will open any links in Safari. Chrome: When Chrome originally arrived on iOS, it was slow, but still managed to work so well with Google's other products that people used it anyway. Now, the two are equally speedy. Alongside features you expect in any browser, Chrome on iOS has a few Google-specific quirks, like a built-in QR scanner, Google Now support, a translator, and more. Chrome also tends to hide a lot of its interface, foregoing the bottom navigation bar prevalent in Safari and instead placing everything up top. This is an aesthetic thing, but design matters enough that you might prefer how one works over the other. Which browser is best for you is partially a matter of preference, but it also matters what other apps you use. Let's dig into where Chrome makes more sense than Safari and vice versa. Chrome's Voice Search Works Extremely Well If you want to search for stuff online with your voice, you want to use Chrome. Google pushes its voice assistant hard in Chrome in iOS and it works stupidly well. With a hard-press of the Chrome icon you can search before even open the app, and once you're in Chrome, you'll find the voice search icon everywhere you look. More importantly, the voice search is accurate, pulling up most results perfectly. This sounds like a minor feature, but if you can't or aren't good at typing on a phone's small keyboard, having what's essentially a dictation function comes in handy. For its part, Safari has the regular old dictation button that's built into iOS, but it's not voice search specific and doesn't work as well. Of course, you can also search using Siri, but it's not as fluid or useful as the voice search in Chrome. Chrome Plays Nice With All of Google's Apps, Safari Plays Nice with Everything A while back, Apple introduced a "deep linking" feature that essentially lets apps communicate with each other. While it's not a replacement for "default" apps like on Android, it does make it so developers can do things like have a URL link from Gmail open up in Chrome instead of Safari. As you'd expect, Google has taken full advantage of this. Provided you're a Google user on a lot of services, from Drive to Gmail to Maps, you can make it so all those apps communicate with Chrome. For example, when you tap a link to a map in Chrome and it opens up Google Maps, or tap an email link in Chrome and it opens Gmail. If you're deeply invested in Google, this works wonderfully and makes it so you can ignore Safari altogether. If you're not a heavy Google user, things get less interesting. Safari is still the default browser, which means URLs you get in text messages, Apple Mail, or links you search in Spotlight all route thought through Safari. While some third-party apps, like Spark or Airmail, have an "Open in" option that lets you choose your browser, that's not the case in all apps, so you're bound to still use Safari now and again. Unless you're very much into Google, Safari is probably your best option so you don't have to bounce between the two all the time. Both Sync with Their Desktop Apps There is one final, big reason why you'd choose one browser over the other. Both Safari and Chrome sync with their desktop counterparts. This means your tabs, history, and bookmarks all sync from your phone to your desktop. If this matters to you, then you'll want to go with whichever browser you use on your computer. Personally, while syncing always seems like a cool idea, it's something I never, ever use, so this doesn't matter to me as much as I initially thought it would. If you're in the same boat and don't actually utilise this, don't let the idea that you could affect your decision for which browser to use. Safari's Reading List is Great, but Chrome Has One On the Way An often forgotten about feature in Safari is its Reading List. Here, you get a Instapaper-esque list of articles you've saved for reading later. It's great if you read a lot on your phone and have no interest in more advanced options like Pocket or Instapaper. Chrome does not offer this at all right now, but it's rumoured to be on the way soon. Until we know how that actually works, Safari is your better option here. Of course, for now, Chrome users can still use a third-party app like Pocket or Instapaper. Safari Can Block Ads and Trackers If you're someone who blocks ads or third-party trackers using an ad blocker, then your choice here is very clear: use Safari. The "content blockers" introduced in iOS 9 only support Safari, and Chrome doesn't have any similar type of plugin. These content blockers aren't about ads, they also block cookies, weird page elements, specific URLs, comments, and more. So, if you want to mess around with any of that stuff, you want to stick with Safari. The Verdict: Chrome Is Great If You're Deep In Google's Ecosystem, Safari Is Best for Everyone Else Which browser is best for you depends on a lot things, including a general preference for how it works. Some people like Chrome's more minimal aesthetic enough that features don't actually matter. Others like the fact that Safari integrates automatically without any tweaking. In any case, if you like the "feel" of one over the other, know that they're both equally speedy and feature-complete, so there's no reason to actively avoid either. The one clear difference comes if you're an avid Google product user. Chrome does an excellent job of linking up with the rest of Google's apps, enough so that you almost feel like you're not even on an iPhone. In that case, stick to Chrome and you'll be happy. If you seek out other apps that deep link to Chrome you'll be able to pretend like Safari doesn't exist. For everyone else, stick with Safari. It's come a long way over the years and it works perfectly well. Is it a little boring? Sure. But how exciting do you want your browser to be? Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

By: Abhinaya Prabhu Published: Monday, March 13, 2017, 15:45 [IST] Google has rolled out an update to the Android Gboard adding GIF and emoji suggestion features as the users type using it. The update also added a handy voice-to-text command feature along with these features. The Gboard for iOS devices had these features and the Android version is catching up with its rival only now. This update offers many new features to the Android Gboard including quick translation, personalized keyboard backgrounds, voice-to-text function, etc. For now, the suggestion feature is supported only by the instant messaging apps including Snapchat, Allo, Facebook Messenger, and Hangouts. Google is expected to introduce these features to the other apps as well in the near future. With the update, the Android devices get voice typing capabilities with an upgraded UI. This lets them switch back to the usual typing mode easily. Besides these features, new keyboard themes have also been installed to various devices based on Android. These can be accessed from the Gboard settings or the Theme icon in the quick feature menu in the suggestion strip. Also Read: These Microsoft Surface Phone renders may be too futuristic Gboard for Android also supports Google Translate and the same can be accessed from the quick feature menu. Eventually, the translation tool will offer text interpretations as users type sentences in real time. For now, Android phones thrive with the right-to-left language support on Gboard for search and share features. For instance, the Farsi, Hebrew, and Arabic texts are written the other way around in comparison to normal typing. Android users can download the latest version of Gboard for Android from the Google Play Store and experience these new feature additions and improvements.

Search warrants to access metadata from an entire cell tower are becoming more and more popular, too. What isn't common though, is a search warrant for the internet history of an entire town. While this sounds like something from the "what not to do" chapter in a law textbook, it is happening right now in the town of Edina, Minnesota. A thief faxed in a fake passport to a credit union which allowed him to steal $28,500 out of a victim's bank account. Police were notified of the fraudulent transfer and discovered that the photo used on the passport could be accessed by searching Google Images for the victim's name. It doesn't show up in Yahoo or Bing searches, so police are hoping to use Google to help track down their thief. The county judge agreed with the police and granted the warrant, which was then served to Google. The warrant, if Google agrees to provide the information, allows the police to collect names, emails, account information, and IP addresses of anyone who searched for the victim's name during a five-week period. Googling someone's name isn't illegal, so privacy experts are up in arms over the potential to collect information on innocent users. Possible employers, friends, or anyone who happened to be interested in the victim during the time period in question could have their personal information handed over to the authorities. By casting such a wide net, the Edina Police Department are also opening themselves to the possibility of evidence being thrown out before a trial if it is deemed to have been obtained illegally. Google and the Police Department aren't saying much since it is an ongoing investigation, but the full can be viewed on security researcher Tony Webster's website. 9 comments 283 interactions Share this article: Now Read This… Google's new reCAPTCHA is so smart, you won't even know it's there Obama's planning a coup: Google Home is sharing fake news stories Google launches first gigabit wireless home internet service Popular 20 comments Mass Effect: Andromeda Graphics Performance Tested Customizing Chrome's New Tab page Load Comments 9 ...

"Alexa, please buy me 30 boxes of Fruit Roll-Ups." Image: mashable By Jack Morse2017-03-16 02:22:12 UTC Amazon Echo and Google Home can make you feel like you’ve stumbled across a genie: say what you want and, like magic, it appears on your doorstep. That's both cool and convenient — until it isn't. And as the incident earlier this year where a 6-year-old girl ordered a $170 dollhouse and four pounds of cookies demonstrates, it often isn't.  SEE ALSO: Amazon Echo finally gets the one feature it should have had when it launched Kids are ingenious little creatures. Soon they'll realize getting Nintendo Switch accessories or a hot pizza delivered no longer necessitates kicking and screaming. Instead, just ask Alexa nicely.  Makers of the devices are not oblivious to the threat posed by children, and have taken small steps to protect them (the devices — not the children).  How to turn voice-activated purchases off For Amazon Echo, the first and most drastic step is to disable purchasing by voice. Notably, this feature is turned on by default, so after you register your new device, you'll want to immediately open up the Alexa app navigation panel and select "Settings" then "Voice Purchasing." You can now turn off "purchase by voice." Voilà. Potential crisis averted.  Google Home hanging out at home. Image:  LILI SAMS/MASHABLE Google Home offers the similar ability to toggle on and off what it calls "voice orders." Although, unlike with the Eco, this feature is not turned on by default. This is good news for parents who don't feel the inclination to wade through a multi-step process. If you have turned voice orders on, but are having second thoughts now that Junior has started to speak, you can disable the feature by hitting the Menu icon in the Google Home app and scrolling over to "More Settings" then "Payments." Select “Pay with your Assistant” and you have just disabled that feature.  If you still want to order stuff with your voice What if you want your kids locked out of voice ordering but still think it's a good idea to restock Easy Cheese while you lie supine on the couch?  Alexa offers you a compromise: Securing your voice orders with a four-digit password. Navigate your way back to "Voice Purchasing" and select "(Optional) Require confirmation code." Select a code, and you're all set — assuming your kids don't learn the code.  Google Home does not have a similar password-protected option. Fortunately, it does currently have some roadblocks that may slow a young one down. At present, Google Home can only order things from a specific list of Google Express retailers. That limits your angel to only buying things offered at one of those store, although Toys"R"Us is one of those stores. Also, for the time being there is a $100 limit on orders, and each order can only consist of one item. Both are little consolation, but consolation nonetheless.  Sadly, neither Amazon Echo nor Google Home offer great tools to prevent little troublemakers from having their way with the shopping list. Amazon's four-digit password is a start, but becomes more or less worthless as soon as a kid hears you use it once. Until the companies figure out a way to restrict users based on specific voices, the safest best is just to disable the feature all together.  That's right, you'll just have to use your ever-present smartphone to order your random internet junk. And hey, feel free to blame it on the kid — we won't tell.

How are districts using Smart School money for tech? Some buy laptops, some security cameras Zachary Matson | March 18, 2017 SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE PIN EMAIL Draper Middle School students make a slideshow with their Chromebooks. Sarah Strauss is seen through the center. Photographer: MARC SCHULTZ The routines in 24-year teaching veteran Kim Coelho’s Draper Middle School class may never be the same. “Traditionally, kids would come in and write in a journal. Now they log into Google and their journal entry is waiting for them – the question is right there,” said Coelho, a Mohonasen sixth-grade social studies and English teacher. “You see the journals in the crate over there?” she said pointing to stack of multi-colored notebooks stacked in the back of the room. “They stay there.” Instead, each of her 26 students during a class last week had a laptop on their desk. She asked the students to pull out their earbuds so they could listen to a short video about ancient Rome. Some of the kids looked around; oops, they forgot their earbuds. “That’s a new little problem,” she said. “Kids used to forget pencils, now they forget earbuds.” Working from Google classroom, Coelho can track student responses on daily journal entries or small quizzes as they come in. She can submit answers for multiple choice or true and false questions and the program will automatically grade students' answers. On writing assignments, Coelho can offer feedback directly into a student’s essay, even communicating with the student in real-time – digitally. Teachers, who are driving how the Chromebooks are used in their classrooms, can develop assignments together, making changes or offering revisions directly into a shared document. But it’s about what the technology does for the students, Coelho said, adding that the students will often find ways to use programs she could never figure out on her own. “There’s like a classroom and all the work we can just click on this and go to an assignment,” said 11-year-old Hayden Goldstein as he showed off his Chromebook. “We get to use computers in school; it’s more fun than just using a book.” Using nearly $1.4 million of its over-$1.7 million Smart School state technology allocation, Mohonasen last month rolled out the Chromebooks to every sixth-grade student and Chromebook carts to be shared among classes in other grades – 750 Chromebooks in all. The spending included small upgrades to the district network, purchase of a new phone system and other classroom technology. Every school district in the state gets a cut of the $2 billion state bonds approved by voters in 2014 to enhance technology in schools. Winning state approval for its Smart Schools spending plan in June, Mohonasen is among the earliest districts to move forward with the months-long process of seeking public input and getting school board approval for a spending plan before submitting it to the state. A committee of state officials meets every few months to approve the plans. Their first round of purchases have gotten into the classrooms over the past few months and they plan to submit for state reimbursements this spring. But school district leaders throughout the Capital Region are not of one mind of how to best spend the Smart School money. While some districts are using the money to jumpstart major laptop initiatives – moving toward one computer for every student – others are shoring up network infrastructure and expanding high-tech school security. The Ballston Spa school district, one of the few districts in the region planning to move forward with at least some computer-based testing this spring, hasn’t advanced any plan yet.   Of course, different districts have different needs and some have more developed technology infrastructure than others. But the different approaches to spending the Smart School dollars may represent different answers to a basic question: Is it smart for schools to use a one-time infusion of state cash to purchase technology with a lifespan as short as four or five years? Niskayuna Superintendent Cosimo Tanogrra Jr. said he doesn’t think it’s appropriate to spend bond dollars on products that will be obsolete in a shorter timeframe than the debt will be paid off. That’s why the district doesn’t plan to use its Smart Schools money on student and classroom devices that would ultimately need to be replaced using general fund dollars. “I do feel an obligation to be not only a steward of the local taxpayer dollars but any of the taxpayer dollars that come into the district,” Tangorra said. Niskayuna’s initial plan uses nearly $490,000 – one third of its $1.49 million allotment – to replace over 200 aging surveillance cameras throughout the district and improve its digital video archiving capabilities. Tangorra said he hopes to have a plan in place for the next phase of Smart Schools spending in the next two months – a plan that will be focused on improving the district’s network infrastructure. Fonda-Fultonville technology director Jarrod Baker said the rural district is focused on replacing old cabling at the high school and replacing and expanding the number of internet access points. With its inital $1.1 million Smart School spending, the district can replace all of its current 44 access points, and add 56 new ones, putting a wireless access point in every other classroom. The cabling work lays the foundation for the district to eventually add access points in every classroom, Baker said. By strengthening the basic network infrastructure, Baker said, the district will be positioned to roll out an expansion of student devices. “As we look to the future and student devices and teacher devices, those things should come from the regular budget and regular funds,” Baker said. “It’s not a question of it (there will be more devices), it’s a question of when. The density of device will require more thorough wireless coverage.” But nearby districts – such as Mohonasen, Schalmont, Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake – aren’t afraid to use the Smart Schools money to plow forward with big investments in classroom technology, including hundreds of Chromebook laptops for students, iPads and interactive whiteboards. Officials in those districts say they are planning to transition the costs of subsequent replacement of those devices – which will quickly become the baseline expectation for students and parents – to general funds. They also point out that some future technology purchases will still be partially covered by different state aid formulas. While Schalmont has moved further toward a one-to-one student-computer ratio than nearly any other district in the region, it also faces a challenging budget picture this year and officials expect to face budget holes in coming years as well. The district started a sixth-grade digital literacy class and has Chromebooks in the hands of nearly every middle-schooler. Just the other week, the school board approved the purchase of a digital social studies textbook for sixth-graders. The district thinks it can use the Smart Schools money to deliver laptops to nearly all of its students in middle and high school grades.    Schalmont Superintendent Carol Pallas said the district plans to prioritize its technology investments in coming years, even as it considers cuts in this year’s budget to teacher aides, out-of-district special education placements, athletic travel and field trips.    “I don’t believe that we will be able to say never mind, we won’t have such things,” Pallas said of the student laptops and other technology. “Teaching kids to be digitally literate is a real priority. We know this is the right thing to do for kids and we will try our best to maintain and sustain it in the budget.” Of Capital Region district’s that have submitted spending plans, some have also taken a balanced approach. While Saratoga Springs plans to spend nearly $2 million on classroom technology, the district is also planning to spend nearly $500,000 on its wireless connections. To Mohonasen, the state funding will serve to jumpstart its broader goal of getting more technology into the classroom, district Finance Director Chris Ruberti said. Over time the district will plan for replacing computers from the general fund.  “Smart Schools can be an infusion that gets the initiative up and running,” Ruberti said. “We then have a multi-year plan to wean off of Smart Schools [funding].” The district’s goal is for every student in sixth through 12th grades to have his or her own Chromebook – a low-priced Google-powered laptop – that would be used in class and at home. Using its first batch of Smart Schools money, the district got a computer for all of its sixth-graders. Beginning in the fall, it will do the same for two grades each year until all of its middle and high school students have computers by the school year that starts in 2020. At that point, the district will have to replace about 400 to 450 laptops each year, which will partially be offset using the district’s BOCES reimbursement rate from the state – paying for about two-thirds of those certain technology purchases. He pointed out that with the one-to-one computers for students, the district won’t have to replace desktops at the same level it has in the past. “There’s also some costs you are avoiding,” Ruberti said. Starting in kindergarten Meanwhile, even Mohonasen kindergartners get a daily dollop of technology. Every classroom at Bradt Primary School, the district’s kindergarten-through-second-grade school, has an interactive whiteboard that teachers use for hands-on math lessons, animated videos and book read-alouds.   “We have conversations about reliable sources and being responsible on the computer,” Bradt Principal Leslie Smith said. “Kids are so curious at this age and hopefully we see it continue; technology can be that bridge to carry that curiosity forward.” In Jessica Filarecki’s kindergarten class on Thursday, math time was spent with the interactive white board. Each student had a work mat at their desk with a series of simple subtraction problems and red felt counters to work out each problem. On the white board, Filarecki called on different students to work out the problem. With the touch and swipe of a pen, the students can make big red dots appear and disappear. “There were four students on the stage and one walked away. How many are left?” Filarecki asked. One of the students walked up to the board, where a previous student had placed four digital counters and swiped one away. Four minus one equals three.

It gives you email, a cool search engine, a fantastic Maps app and plenty of cloud storage, all for free. We also tend to forget that it's an ad company. Until an ad pops up on someone's Google Home device, anyway. Over the last couple of days, Google Home users have heard a little spot about the opening of Beauty and the Beast when they ask for a summary of the day ahead. "By the way, Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast opens today," says, Google Home, in between spots on the weather and whatever other news stories are popular at the moment. Speaking with The Verge, Google issued two statements, one seems to suggest it is an ad despite explicitly saying it's not. They then quickly followed up with a statement that suggests it's not an ad but rather some type of algorithm deciding what content to dish out to you. Here's the first statement: This isn't an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales. And here's the second statement: This wasn't intended to be an ad. What's circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case. Regardless of what Google says, we often seem to forget that while Google is many things, it's absolutely an ad company first. According to Adweek, Google made around 88 per cent of its revenue from ads in the second quarter of last year. Google has since pulled the not-ad from Home, and while they're denying it's an ad, it's hard to see it as anything but a test run of just that. Even if it's not and was an earnest mistake, the idea of putting personalised ads on Google Home seems like a no-brainer. To expect the company we already let mine our emails to display better ads to do anything but shove ads in our faces on all their products seems delusional. Google Home, just like the Amazon Echo, is billed as an assistant but is clearly also a means to sell you more things. In Google's case, it's also yet another way to round out your profile to advertisers. While there's no evidence either company is monitoring the microphone the same way they monitor what you do online in order to display personalised ads, I wouldn't be surprised to see that as a feature in the future. Alexa is probably a little easier to understand for most of us, as everyone assumes that a product they buy from Amazon is at least partially there to sell products on Amazon, but we tend to forget that Google is doing the same thing.

Now, a new report suggests that Google might be working with the operator to develop an affordable 4G handset for the Indian consumer market. The Hindu Business Line cites unnamed industry sources aware of the "secret" project between Google and Reliance Jio, saying that the two companies are developing an affordable smartphone with 4G capabilities exclusive to Reliance Jio's network. According to the aforementioned sources, this will not only benefit Reliance Jio in the form of increased data adoption, improvements to the quality of its service, and exposure to a larger market, but also allow Google access to a large number of potential users who are connecting to the internet for the first time. The move would also boost Google's Android One initiative to bring low-cost handsets to developing countries like India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam - a program that it later expanded to the US and European markets as well. That said, it is important to note that both the companies haven't confirmed the report as of yet, so it is important to take this piece of news with a rather large grain of salt.

Neither is paying for bandwidth to serve or receive those images. We've reported in the recent past on Google's efforts to get more detail out of small images and reduce file sizes of images and other web files. The company's Guetzli JPEG encoding algorithm improvement effort looks to have a greater immediate impact because of its ability to potentially reduce image file sizes by up to 35% at the same image quality level when compared to traditional encoders, while maintaining decoding compatibility with existing browsers. Left: original, center: libjpeg, right: Guetzli. Note the reduced artifacting in the image on the right compared to the center image. Guetzli is the product of Google Research Europe, and has been released under the Apache open source license. The development team says the overall approach is similar to the one used in Google's earlier Zopfli algotithm used to compress gzip files and PNG images, and shares little with the RAISR and WebP methods that require "ecosystem changes for compression gains at internet scale," a fancy way of saying they're new formats and need big changes to server and browser software. Left: original, center: libjpeg, right: Guetzli. Again, note the difference in artifacting between the center and rightmost images. JPEG compression has several steps, including color space transformation, discrete cosine transformation, and quantization. According to the Guetzli developers, quantization is the key step where visual quality loss is traded for compression efficiency. Google says Guetzli uses a search algorithm to reduce the difference betweem JPEG's psychovisual modeling and the algorithm's own psychovisual model, which it says "approximates color perception and visual masking in a more detailed way." The result is more detail with smaller file sizes, at a cost of substantially higher resource utilization at compression time. Google says Guetzli can produce smaller file sizes with the same level of quality. The company performed experiments where images of equal file size were shown to study participants who consistently prefered the imaged compressed using Guetzli. It's worth noting that even though the encoding process is slower, that should have a relatively small real-world on servers since image downloads vastly outnumber uploads, where the processing takes place. A new JPEG compression algorithm doesn't sound as exciting as a method of enhancing small images like fictional forensics investigators in television shows do all the time, but the ability to reduce file sizes without requiring updates to browsers is probably more useful, particularly in the near future. The developers close their notes with wishes that others will pick up the baton and apply the techniques to other image fromats and to video.

Various companies are developing self-driving car systems right now, with Google, Tesla, and Uber among the current leaders in the emerging space. And two of those companies are about to clash in a court battle that might determine the early winner of the self-driving car race. Don't Miss: Samsung has done the impossible with the Galaxy S8 Google, some would say, is in an advantageous position. It’s not a car maker, but it has developed a self-driving car project that’s probably ahead of anything in the works from bigger players in the automotive industry. But Google recently lost a key engineer who’s been working on Google’s self-driving cars for a decade. Anthony Levandowski went on to found Otto, a self-driving truck company that was acquired by Uber last year for $700 million. A few weeks ago, Waymo, which is Google’s driverless car spinoff — sued Uber for trade secret theft and patent infringement after discovering that Levandowski developed a lidar system for Uber that copies the lider setup he created for Google. Who’s right and who’s wrong? Bloomberg Businessweek has the inside story on this particular dispute, which reveals the complexities of these emerging technologies, but also their potential. Google started investigating Levandowski last summer after Uber bought Otto, and discovered he allegedly used a company laptop to copy about 14,000 design files from Waymo to a card reader, before wiping all the data from the laptop. Google, however, did not act on its findings until December 13th, when a Google employee received an email that a supplier wanted to send to Otto. In the message was a drawing of a lidar circuit board that had Otto’s name on it but looked identical to Google. Bloomberg explains that it’s a Google policy not to sue former employees for patent infringement, something engineers frequently find out about during orientation. If, however, Google does decide to move to a patent-based trial against a former employee, then it means the person has done something seriously wrong, the report says. Lidar is a component that allows cars to see their surroundings, which is obviously a key feature for self-driving cars. A multi-lens off-the-shelf sensor costs $80,000, but Google developed a single-lens lidar system that’s a lot cheaper. The report reveals that it was actually Levandowski’s lidar team that came up with the creation. Bloomberg explains that Levandowski founded two other companies before Otto that were developing self-driving car products while he was working on the same products at Google. Google eventually purchased both firms. The report also goes on to say that Google decided to let Levandowski work on his side projects, even if that meant skipping work. After one internal dispute between the engineer and his boss Chris Urmson, Levandowski skipped work for months to focus on his other projects. Levandowski butted heads with Urmson about the way Google was supposed to sell self-driving technology. Levandowski wanted each innovation (self-parking or highway pilot) to be sold when ready and retroactively fitted on commercial cars, while Urmson argued for an all-in-one solution, a car that’s able to drive itself in all conditions. Levandowski wasn’t necessarily the most popular guy inside Google. Larry Page had to appoint Urmson instead of Levandowski to lead the car team exactly because of the latter’s controversial style, which drew criticism among his peers. But the report seems to cement the idea that Levandowski was an essential Google employee, and that he’ll further influence the autonomous car market regardless of who prevails in Google’s court battle with Uber. In addition to his engineering skills and his desire to push the technology to the limits of what was possible both from a technical and legal point, the engineer also took matters into his own hands in seeking to legalize self-driving car tests. Levandowski hired a lobbyist in Nevada and wrote a law to allow companies to test autonomous cars with a human driver behind the wheel.

News UK Home News Banks join queue of advertisers ditching Google over extremist YouTube videos Internet giant facing mounting pressure over continued refusal to accept responsibility for content Rachel Roberts Sunday 19 March 2017 16:58 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online The internet giant is being urged to take greater responsibility for the content that appears on its platforms AFP/Getty Images Google is scrambling to respond to criticism after three of the UK’s biggest banks pulled their adverts from its platform after their campaigns appeared alongside extremist YouTube videos. HSBC, Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) took the decision over fears some of their advertising budgets are being used to fund banned hate preachers, racists and terrorist organisations, including Isis. The banking giants’ withdrawal follows hard on the heels of multinational companies including McDonald’s, L’Oreal and Audi, a number of Government departments and media organisations including the BBC, Channel 4 and The Guardian, who have suspended adverting on Google’s search engine and its YouTube video platform. Read more UK to question Google over extremist content American giant Google, the world’s most valuable brand worth more than $109bn (£88bn), according to Forbes, has been plunged into crisis with the loss of the banks’ advertising. Google controls around 35 per cent of all online advertising, but its market dominance could be seriously compromised if other major advertisers desert the platform. Sky, Barclays and Vodafone are understood to be considering whether to cancel their campaigns unless Google is able to resolve the problem rapidly. Advertising executives have urged the company to “get its house in order” and take decisive action to dissociate the brand from extremism. Read more Havas: French ad giant 'pulls ad spend from Google and YouTube' An investigation by The Times found ads for dozens of leading firms have been shown alongside videos posted by extremists including David Duke, former leader of the Klu Klux Klan.  Numerous other racists, holocaust deniers and rape apologists have received payouts from Google for YouTube commercials.  Taxpayer-funded ads for various branches of the British Government were appearing alongside Isis propaganda videos and other offensive content. An ad appearing alongside a YouTube video earns the poster around £6 for every 1,000 clicks it generates, meaning brands have unwittingly contributed funds to extremists. Google pips Apple as world's 'most valuable' brand The issue appears to be related to the use of AdX, Google’s DoubleClick Ad Exchange Service, which uses automated trading of ads on various sites through a variety of algorithms – a process in which humans are rarely directly involved. Read more Another 100 companies pull advertising from Breitbart Internet giants including Facebook and Google have historically absolved themselves of responsibility for some of the content hosted on their platforms by insisting they are “technology companies” rather than media outlets, meaning they cannot be regulated and fined in the way that newspapers, books or magazines would be if they published the views of extremists. Sir Martin Sorrell, head of global ad agency WPP, told news site Business Insider the controversy reinforces his belief that Google, Facebook and other platforms have to admit they are media companies and face up to their responsibilities. “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies have the same responsibilities as any other media company,” Mr Sorrell said.  “They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements.” The Guardian CEO David Pemsel said in a letter to Google that many brands feel they have to place their ads on the company’s services because of the dominant position that Google, YouTube and the DoubleClick ad platform have in the marketplace. “It is therefore vital that Google, DoubleClick and YouTube uphold the highest standards in terms of openness, transparency, and measures to avoid advertising fraud and misplacement in the future,” Mr Pemsel said. “It is very clear that this is not the case at the moment.” Ronan Harris, a senior Google executive in the UK, addressed the problem in a blog post, saying the company does its best to ensure that client ads are not published alongside offensive content.  “However, with millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don’t always get it right,” he said. Mr Harris admitted Google needs to “do a better job of addressing the small number of inappropriately monetised videos and content,” and that the company plans to introduce more ways for customers to control how and where their ads appear.

By Megan Nisbet Sunday, March 19, 2017 The top ten most Googled baby questions revealed [Getty] There's a new mouth to feed, a nappy to change and a life to look after. But now Search Laboratory has unveiled the top ten questions expecting mothers are asking Google, and they might surprise you. On average Google receives a monthly total of 11,500 searches about unborn babies and what it takes to be a good parent. But the top secret bump questions pregnant women are eager to get answers for are shocking. Here's the 10 most common questions expecting mums are asking Google... 1. Will my baby be ginger?

Will my baby have blue eyes? 7. Will my baby be allergic to cats? 8. Will my baby be a boy or a girl? 9. What will happen to my baby if I drink coffee? 10. What will happen to my baby if I sleep on my right side? The Google searches revealed surprising results [Search Laboratory] Questions that try to determine the baby's genetics, such as ginger hair, curly hair or whether it's a boy or a girl, simply can't be answered by Google, so we're shocked they rank so highly. And if your baby is ugly – which we highly doubt any mother would think that of her own child – there's also nothing that can be done, other than hope he or she grows out of it. However, we can have a go at answering a few others. Why is my bump so high? According to Emma's Diary you won't know whether your bump is low or high until around 28 weeks when the uterus moves higher up in the abdomen. The NHS adds that by 28 weeks your baby weighs around 1kg and is perfectly formed, taking up more space in your stomach, which can in turn cause heartburn. Expecting mums have been asking pretty strange questions [Getty] What will happen to my baby if I drink coffee? According to the NHS high levels of caffeine can result in babies having a low birth weight, which can increase the risk of health problems in later life. Too much caffeine can also cause miscarriage. It's advised to have no more than 200mg of coffee a day. What will happen to my baby if I sleep on my right side? A study in 2011 linked sleeping positions while pregnant to still-birth. According to the BBC the University of Auckland compared 155 women who had late still-births with 310 who had healthy pregnancies. They found that sleeping on the back or right side, rather than the left, doubled the risk - but only to almost four in 1,000. At the time, the NHS advised pregnant women to contact their GPs if they were worried.

Planet, company which owns and operates fleet of miniature satellites, acquired Terra Bella from Google to enhance own services with fleet of high resolution satellites. Google sold Planet one of its main competitors on the market. Planet, which operates at the moment fleet of 60 Cubesat satellites deployed mainly from International Space Station, starts in this way new era of development. In February Company will add another 88 Cubesats deployed from Indian PSLV rocket and also take control over satellites owned by Terra Bella, known previously as Skybox. These two steps will result in increasing number of satellites operated by Planet, to over 168 in the end of the 2017. Company will operate 7 SkySat high resolution satellites, it will add them to another satellites acquired after purchasing another competitor –  5 RapidEye satellites which are operated by Blackbridge Ltd., which was purchased in 2015. It is worth to remind, that Terra Bella planned delivering to orbit 8 SkySat satellites representing second generation on the top of the Minotaur rocket in 2017. Still, Planet is not able to offer imaging services in such impressive quality like DigitalGlobe, but with their spectacular live video broadcast in high resolution is serious competitor for every company in this segment of space industry. Now with high resolution fleet owned by Terra Bella will seriously increase chances to became a leader.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars TRANSPORTATION Feature How Parkopedia became a parking data powerhouse Paul Sawers@psawers March 19, 2017 7:15 AM Tags: Parkopedia, SpotHero, top-stories Above: Parkopedia for iPhone Image Credit: Paul Sawers / VentureBeat “It didn’t take a genius to realize that if I couldn’t find any useful online information for finding parking in San Francisco, then drivers in Paris, Shanghai, and thousands of other cities around the globe were probably also struggling with the exact same problem,” explained Eugene Tsyrklevich, founder and CEO of London-based parking platform Parkopedia, in an interview with VentureBeat. It was way back in 2007, during the Web 2.0 conference in San Francisco, that Tsyrklevich tried to find a place to park his rental car before his arrival at the event. But after Googling for reliable parking information for the Moscone Center, he came up blank. So he left home earlier than should otherwise have been necessary and circled the block several times until he finally found somewhere to park. “That was the spark for the idea — helping drivers find somewhere to park — which I launched in 2008,” Tsyrklevich explained. Meet Eugene Eugene Tsyrklevich is a computer engineer who holds a BSc and MSc in computer science from the University of California, San Diego. He initially learned how to code in high school and went on to fund his university education by working as a software engineer at a number of tech startups during the late ’90s dotcom boom, which had exploded while he was at university. He started his first business, a consulting company specializing in computer and network security, just after the dotcom revolution went belly up in 2000. “I had the opportunity to travel the world, get paid for legally breaking into corporate networks, and to train the U.S. military in hacking — all before I graduated from university.” After graduating, Tsyrklevich continued consulting, and he went on to work in finance after moving to London in 2004. Fast-forward 10 years from that frustrating day outside the Moscone Center, and Parkopedia is now one of the biggest parking data compendiums in the world. Headquartered in London, the company describes itself as a “Wikipedia for parking,” and — through a suite of apps — serves up information on availability and pricing of parking meters, parking spaces, parking lots, and even private driveways for hire. Above: Parkopedia founder and CEO Eugene Tsyrklevich at London HQ. Image Credit: Mark Earthy Parkopedia today Much has changed at Parkopedia since the original incarnation was unveiled back in 2008, as the entire connected landscape has shifted from desktops to the pocket, with many cars now permanently online too. Moving with the times as a fledgling startup is always difficult, but when you’re completely new to an industry, things are just that little bit harder. “When I had the idea for Parkopedia, I knew nothing about the parking industry, maybe apart from how to feed a parking meter,” said Tsyrklevich. “The first version of the website, which I built myself, allowed drivers to find parking lots in San Diego and San Francisco. Within months, we expanded to London and Sydney, and we have carried on adding cities ever since.” Though Parkopedia is a consumer-facing service in its own right, claiming around three million monthly users, it’s not a household name like Uber, Google Maps, or some other transport-focused services. But it has achieved scale by powering countless third-party services from major global brands. Today, Parkopedia says that it serves more than 6,000 cities across 75 countries. In 2015, GM subsidiary OnStar launched AtYourService, a new “commerce and engagement” product that connects drivers with merchants during drives — serving up information and offers related to their route and destination, including hotels and places to eat. Parkopedia was one of the launch partners, used by OnStar to give subscribers in North America and Europe a “premium parking service” that includes dynamic space availability. This week, the duo renewed their deal, which will extend the partnership by another three years. Back in 2011, Parkopedia added Garmin to its Roster of clients, powering the GPS tech giant’s navigation devices with such data as real-time parking space availability. This was followed a year later by a global deal to power BMW’s in-car parking information service. Last July saw what was arguably Parkopedia’s pièce de résistance when the company inked a global deal with Apple to power parking information in Apple Maps. And shortly after that, Parkopedia entered an agreement with TomTom to provide data to its own automotive customers, followed by Audi China a few months later. Throw into the mix Ford, Jaguar, Land Rover, Peugeot, Toyota, and Volvo, and you start to get an idea of Parkopedia’s reach. “With the continued growth of Parkopedia’s coverage, as well as explosion of connected devices and cars, Parkopedia grew rapidly and now works with most car manufacturers globally,” explained Tsyrklevich. Show me the money What’s perhaps most notable, in this age of unicorns and failed tech IPOs, is that Parkopedia has yet to take on a single dime of venture capital. Moreover, the company says that it’s profitable, making enough money through licensing its services to its business customers and funding everything from its cash flow. “When we were starting out, we did consider taking on VC investment and pitched to a number of firms,” said Tsyrklevich. “However, we didn’t raise any VC investment and ended up bootstrapping to profitability.” Whenever a major client is announced, says Tsyrklevich, his company gets a lot of interest from VCs, but he isn’t interested at the moment. “Being profitable and funding our growth and product portfolio development organically, we are currently not actively looking for money,” he said. “This may change in the future with potential acquisitions or entry into new markets.” Parking in the digital age Above: Parkopedia iPhone app: San Francisco parking Image Credit: Paul Sawers / VentureBeat If you’re the sort of person who just shows up at your destination, fingers crossed, hoping to find a parking space, then here’s a quick recap of what kinds of parking data is typically found in Parkopedia and similar services. First up, there’s dynamic, real-time information on available spaces in barriered parking lots — this data is garnered directly from the companies that operate the parking facilities and is complemented by “static” data, which covers such variables as prices, opening hours, and location. But Parkopedia also manually checks much of this data. “On top of the extensive industry network that Parkopedia has built out, we physically re-verify all of the data by deploying field teams globally,” said Tsyrklevich. “This requires significant investment, but that’s the cost of delivering a highly accurate service that is expected of us by our premium brand customers.” In other words, Parkopedia can’t afford to take the data it receives at face value. Additionally, Parkopedia serves up static data for on-street parking in 500 cities around the world, while also providing some real-time availability for on-street parking where sensors are installed. For example, in the City of Westminster, London, Parkopedia receives sensor data from Smart Parking, which provides information about unoccupied on-street parking bays in the city center. Above: Smart Parking Sensor Image Credit: Smart Parking This is an expensive and labor-intensive initiative to scale globally, however, and getting cities to invest in smart sensor technology is a hard sell. “Some cities, such as Los Angeles, London, Shenzhen, and Barcelona, have rolled out sensors in their cities, at least in core business district areas, but they are the exception, despite sensor technology being around since 2007,” continued Tsyrklevich. Given the inherent challenge of garnering real-time data for on-street parking, Parkopedia has been investing in algorithms to predict when spaces may be available where there is no physical counting infrastructure. Back in September 2015, Parkopedia announced a partnership with Garmin, which became the first company to use Parkopedia’s predictive parking smarts, starting in a handful of cities across Germany. Rather than relying on sensors or other expensive hardware, it analyses historical data garnered from cars that already have Parkopedia integrated. It’s not perfect, but it claims around 80 to 90 percent accuracy. Above: Parkopedia’s predictive parking in Garmin (PRNewsFoto/Parkopedia) It’s actually not too dissimilar, in concept at least, to a predictive parking feature that was recently introduced into Google Maps in a handful of U.S. markets. Google collects the data in much the same way it obtains data for its Popular Times feature in Google Search: by aggregating anonymized data from Android users who have “Location History” activated on their device. While Google’s parking feature is no doubt useful to have, it doesn’t quite hold the same sway as Parkopedia’s predictions, because Google doesn’t know for sure whether the parking is legitimate, and the app lacks other fundamental data points, such as pricing and hours of operation. Parkopedia currently employs more than 60 people across its hubs in London, San Diego, and Beijing, and Tsyrklevich says the fastest-growing area for the company right now is its data science division. This burgeoning team includes PhD scientists with backgrounds in robotics, computer vision, and computer science who are working on “statistical models” — among other future-gazing projects — to garner accurate parking availability predictions. Since the predictive parking feature’s initial rollout in Germany’s five largest cities 18 months ago, Parkopedia has signed more deals that have given it access to additional car activity data, and it’s now available in around one hundred cities across Europe and North America, according to Tsyrklevich. “We now process hundreds of millions of data points every single day to figure out parking space availability,” he said. Parking data landscape Above: Parkopedia for iPhone Parkopedia isn’t alone in the parking data / service provision realm. Other notable players include Chicago-based SpotHero, which has raised around $28 million in funding since its inception in 2011 and which connect garages, lots, and valets with car owners across the U.S. Then there’s fellow Chicago-based ParkWhiz, which has nabbed $36 million in venture capital funding since 2006, but again it only operates in the U.S. Parkopedia has local competitors in most major markets, with some offering in-app bookings and payments, while others serve more as information and data providers. Though Parkopedia enables parking reservations for some off-street parking facilities, actual payments can only be made in-car (on-street and off-street), with Parkopedia opening to payments for the first time back in 2014 when it signed a deal with Volvo. Where Parkopedia seeks to stand out from the crowd is by being a truly global parking service provider that covers nearly every facet of the parking spectrum. Perhaps its closest competitor, from a global standpoint at least, is ParkMe, which was acquired by real-time traffic data provider INRIX back in 2015. “Global organizations such as Apple, BMW, Garmin, and so on have a strong preference to work with a single provider who can provide them with global parking coverage, consistently high data quality, and transactional capabilities,” said Tsyrklevich. Another area in which Parkopedia is looking to stand out from the competition is through embracing the fledgling self-driving car industry. The future, according to Parkopedia Above: Parkopedia London HQ Image Credit: Mark Earthy With its in-house army of scientists, Parkopedia is in the early stages of building a system that uses the car itself as the sensor, rather than relying on in-ground sensors, something that would make garnering real-time parking data for streets easier to scale. “The cars act as ‘eyes’ on the road, reporting information to us extracted from their built-in sensors, such as cameras, for example,” said Tsyrklevich, giving a rough outline of what the fledgling technology entails. But what’s perhaps most interesting at Parkopedia in the near-term is that it’s forging ahead with plans to infiltrate the fast-growing autonomous vehicle movement. A day doesn’t go by without the burgeoning self-driving car industry hitting the headlines, and flying cars are now entering the fray too. But amidst all the hullabaloo of self-guiding cars traversing busy highways and local conurbations, it’s easy to forget that the rise of autonomous vehicles also presents an interesting opportunity for companies such as Parkopedia. Back in January, the company announced a project it had been working on with Volkswagen’s research group that involves building parking technology and services for autonomous vehicles. Part of the work included creating high-definition autonomous driving (HAD) maps of multi-storey parking facilities across Germany. The maps enable vehicles to position themselves while driving indoors “with a precision of one centimeter” without relying on GPS connectivity, according to Parkopedia, and while navigating in fully automated mode. “The self-parking car of the future will need excellent data to find the right parking spot, transaction capabilities to book and/or pay for it, and indoor navigation capabilities,” said Parkopedia’s COO, Dr. Hans Puvogel, at the time. The road to self-driving cars becoming a reality around the world will be peppered with incremental advances — baby steps, if you will — whereby more advanced features will be introduced in stages. For example, carmakers such as Honda have been working on automated valet parking (AVP) systems for a few years already, letting drivers drop their car off and having strategically positioned cameras take over to enable the car to park itself — and return when the driver wants it. Many cars are already equipped with features like cameras and sensors to help drivers park with precision. And with city congestion and limited parking expected to worsen, the smart parking assistance market is predicted to rise to $5.25 billion by 2021, up from $2.13 billion in 2015, according to a recent report. Put simply, parking is playing a pivotal part in the race to bring automated vehicles to market, and Parkopedia wants to be at the forefront of the movement. Juxtaposing the Parkopedia of 2008 with the company today reveals as much about the broader technological shift in society as it does about Parkopedia’s evolution. “If someone told me 10 years ago that Parkopedia will be running on a supercomputer in your pocket, employ a team of PhD data scientists crunching hundreds of million of data points every day in a cloud, and would be powering autonomous vehicles, I would not have believed it,” said Tsyrklevich.

Pull the AC power cord. Depending upon what you watch on your so-called "smart" TV, disable its WiFi and/or disconnect its ethernet cable. Obviously, that won't work if you watch programming via the internet. Everything is a trade-off. Many of the latest "smart" features require two-way communications. It is bad enough that many TV manufacturers spy on your viewing habits and sell the information to companies that compile data for advertisers. It seems that the government not only can access your viewing habits, but also use the microphone built into your TV or remote control (or in some cases, the speaker in your TV) to eavesdrop as well. You're trapped. Many of the applications (apps) on your smartphone report back to their providers about how you are using your phone. You give them permission in order to enable convenience features. All of the new digital assistants such as Alexa, Siri, Cortana and Google constantly track you and record every query and command. Their originators store this data on servers to be parsed and analyzed for whatever purpose Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google desire. As said in another era, "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch." Even if you turn off your phone, most models still communicate with the nearest cell tower. The only way to make your phone totally invisible is to remove the battery, which is impossible on 95 percent of today's phones. Or you could buy or very cheaply construct a small Faraday cage that blocks all radio signals. Most infuriating is Alphabet's Nest home thermostat. It knows whether you're home or away, records your temperature settings and numerous other environmental factors, and sends the information back to Alphabet's parent, Google, to sell. Once a month, I receive an email with a chart of my heating/cooling energy usage and how it compares with other Nest users. So I called Nest and asked it not to collect data on me. Nest informed me in no uncertain terms that it would be happy to do so, but it would turn my $250 Nest thermostat into a basic dumb unit equivalent to any $20 thermostat you could buy at the home improvement store. This agreement was not printed on the box. Perhaps you don't mind companies and possibly the government tracking your every move. You may consider it a fair trade for free or enhanced services. I admit to allowing Google to know my whereabouts in return for Google Maps route guidance and traffic information. I'd rather pay for the service with the agreement that Google would not store any information concerning my travels. More on the death of vehicle CD players A reader concurred with the column on the disappearance of CD players from vehicles: "Good article on the death of CD players. I bought a RAM Rebel last summer. It never occurred to me to check on whether or not it had a CD player. I just assumed it did. Bad assumption. I'd driven it for two weeks before moving my stack of CDs to the console and selecting one to play. I couldn't find the slot, and the manual was no help, so I called the salesman and asked where they'd hidden it. 'Oh, nobody uses those anymore, so your truck doesn't have one. You have satellite instead, for one year free.' 'OK,' I said, 'I'll give it a shot.' I did, and if I hadn't paid so much for the vehicle, I'd seriously give Sirius/XM two barrels of shot, 12 gauge grade — all they do is talk, talk, talk and play stuff I don't like. I hate having no choices anymore other than those they allow me to have. So I rarely use it, tuning in the regular radio instead, which I don't like either for the same reasons as above. At least it's free." Rich Warren, who lives in the Champaign area, is a longtime reviewer of consumer electronics. He can be emailed at hifiguy@mchsi.com.

The popular web browser has a fair few hidden secrets for users to come across, but this one is particularly tongue in cheek. Google 3 The Google Chrome app features a tab counter in the top right corner When you open the Chrome app, you’ll see a counter in the top corner which keeps track of the number of tabs you currently have open. But when this number hits 100, the indicator changes to a smiley face instead – unless it’s 100 incognito tabs you have open. If your number of incognito tabs – which allow users to browse in private – hits triple digits then the smiley changes to a cheeky winking face instead. Google 3 When you hit 100 incognito tabs, a cheeky winking face crops up The winking face, an uncomfortable reminder that Google knows exactly what you’re up to, only appears on Android phones, although iOS users are still treated to the smiling face. Google loves to smatter their software with cheeky secrets, which crop up in the tech giant’s search engine as well as the web browser.

Getty Images 3 Google loves to smatter its software with hidden secrets for users to stumble across Mystery Search is the hilarious alternate search engine you never knew you needed. Although the little-known site uses the same Google search bar as you’re used to, mystery searches come with a twist which means you rarely get the results you were expecting. That’s because the engine doesn’t show the results for what you just typed in, instead it shows the results for the previous person’s search – meaning you have no idea what you’re going to get. Because it uses the last person’s input, you could be faced with literally anything when you hit that search button, so be warned that the site is not suitable for children and may not be safe for work.

We sometimes cover impressive concept designs to tantalize us while we wait for the launches, while some creations are of unknown devices. Today we’re looking at the iPhone 8 vs Huawei P X vs Google Pixel 2 in a concept clash. We’d like to hear which of these designs you think is best. Leaks and rumors about the iPhone 8 vs Google Pixel 2 and other upcoming devices have been plentiful. However, until they are officially unveiled we won’t know for sure what’s in store. Concept ideas can give us ideas in the meantime and we have three to share today. The new iPhones 2017 have not been officially titled yet and different names such as the iPhone 7S, iPhone 8, or iPhone X are among those rumored. We’ve already seen plenty of iPhone 8 concepts and this new one comes from Gabor Balogh for TechDesigns. You can see it in full in the video that we’ve embedded below. The phone is dubbed the iPhone 8 /X and is tagged ‘A Touch of Life.’ It’s a good-looking metallic handset but no specs have been provided so you’ll have to use your imagination. The next design is the Huawei P X designed by Michael Muleba. There’s no video for this one so we’ve included a couple of images showing the handset. It’s a glossy looking sleek smartphone that has been imagined as a Huawei P10 alternative with an edge-to-edge display. It comes in either a metal or matte finish in a choice of colors and features include quick charging and an iris scanner. The designer has given it a 24-megapixel rear camera with Carl Zeiss optics. We think plenty of readers will admire the styling of this vision. Finally we get to the Google Pixel 2 concept that is shown in full in the second video below and in the image above. It was created by TechConfigurations and has a premium glass and metal build with nicely crafted touches, especially around the edges of the handset and for the curved back. This design also comes with imagined specs such as a Snapdragon 835 chipset, a 5.7-inch display with QHD resolution. It has 4GB and 6GB RAM variants with either 64GB or 128GB of internal memory. This Google Pixel 2 concept includes a 16-megapixel rear camera with dual LED dual tone flash and, 12-megapixel front-facing camera, Features include a fingerprint scanner on the reverse and fast charging. There are front-firing stereo speakers and it’s also dust and water-resistant to IP67 standard. When you’ve checked out all three designs it would be good to hear your views of this iPhone 8 vs Huawei P X vs Google Pixel 2 concept battle. We have our own favorite but we want to hear yours, so do drop us a comment in the usual way.

Google Chrome's version 57 aims to prolong battery life. MANILA, Philippines – The world's most popular browser, Google Chrome, will now consume less energy and less processing power with an update that limits the activity of unused tabs. Opening multiple tabs is a common habit among computer users today. However, the habit can take its toll on battery life and the computer's performance. Chrome, for all its benefits, can be resource-intensive and simultaneously opened tabs can add to the problem. To address this, the latest version of Google Chrome, Chrome 57, now monitors how much processing power a background tab takes from the CPU. If the background tab consumes more than 1% of the CPU's power, the tab's activities are throttled back until it hits the 1% limit. Through this method, Google said it is able to achieve "25% fewer busy background tabs," meaning less strain on the processor and in turn, less strain on the battery. Gizmodo reports, however, that there are a few exceptions to the new throttling policy. Chrome will not stop background music from playing as well as video chat apps and messaging apps such as Slack. Chrome's previous throttling policy monitored how often processes run from a background tab instead of measuring processor consumption. In the future, Google said the ideal solution is for background tab activity to be suspended completely, and to develop new ways for the processing of these background tasks – all in the aim of prolonging battery life. Software-side improvements go hand in hand with the search for higher-capacity batteries as tech and mobile devices march toward an untethered existence.

But the real action is about to take place in the courtroom.  Google and Uber, the two giants at the forefront of developing the technology, are vying to own the emerging market and to suck up the profits. Popular Searches Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 69.98 +0.09 +0.13% Transocean Ltd RIG ▼ 12.22 -0.25 -2.00% LM Ericsson Telephone Co ERIXF ▲ 6.58 +0.21 +3.30% Netflix Inc NFLX ▲ 145.83 +0.72 +0.50% The stakes are high and the fight is already getting personal, with Google accusing one of its star engineers of stealing some of its crown jewels.  Last month, Waymo, the self-driving company owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, sued Uber, claiming that one of its employees stole vital technology shortly before starting his own self-driving company (which Uber later acquired). Autonomous cars have the potential to upend massive industries ranging from transportation to auto manufacturing. For Google and Uber, the opportunity and the threat posed by a world of self-driving vehicles is huge. Google has been developing self-driving technology for the better part of a decade, and plans to license that technology to other car companies through Waymo. There's also a chance Waymo will eventually develop its own ride-hailing service powered by self-driving cars to compete directly with Uber. Uber only recently began exploring self-driving technology, but sees it as the next logical step to protect its business. One of the company's biggest expenses comes from giving drivers a share of the revenue generated on each ride. Cutting out the drivers in favor of self-driving cars would be huge for Uber's bottom line. (And, of course, bad for the drivers who rely on Uber to make a living.) If someone else beats Uber to that self-driving future, Uber will be at a major, perhaps fatal, disadvantage. The trade secrets case is shaping up to be one of the most significant and closely-watched battles in Silicon Valley in years, pitting two of the world's most powerful companies, and former partners, against each other. There's still a long way to go before it's resolved, but here's everything you need to know about what's happened so far. Who's involved? © Provided by Business Insider Inc google waymo Waymo. Last year, Google's self-driving car project spun out of X, the Alphabet division that dreams up "moonshot" projects like internet balloons and delivery drones. The new company is called Waymo and licenses its technology to other car companies that want to build self-driving cars. Waymo has already partnered with Fiat Chrysler. Uber. Uber, the ride-hailing company valued at $69 billion in the private market, is developing self-driving cars, which it believes will one day replace most of its human drivers. Anthony Levandowski. Levandowski is Uber's self-driving car boss. He was a top executive in Google's self-driving car division and left in 2016 to start Otto, a self-driving truck startup. Otto. Otto was bought by Uber last year, a bet by Uber on self-driving cars as well as an effort by the company to expand into the logistics business with self-driving cargo trucks. Waymo's claims Waymo accuses Uber and Otto of stealing its lidar technology. Lidar is the sensor on self-driving cars that allow them to "see" the world as they drive themselves. It's an essential component for self-driving vehicles. Waymo's lawsuit says that Levandowski downloaded 9.7 gigabytes of files containing information about the company's self-driving technology to his laptop and then transferred those files to another external storage device. Those files included plans for Waymo's proprietary lidar system, Waymo says. Levandowski left Google's self-driving division in January of 2016, weeks after downloading the files, Waymo says. He later went on to start Otto, which Uber bought six months later. Levandowski became the head of Uber's self-driving efforts. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Travis Kalanick Anthony Levandowski Waymo says it was accidentally sent an email from one of Uber/Otto's suppliers for lidar equipment late in 2016. The lidar designs in the email "bore a striking resemblance to Waymo’s unique lidar design," Waymo says. This caused Waymo to investigate Levandowski's final weeks at Uber and the company says it discovered evidence that he downloaded the files to the external device. In addition to the lawsuit it filed in February, Waymo asked a judge last week to put a ban on Uber's self-driving car projects until the case is resolved. Uber's defense Uber hasn't issued a formal, legal response to Waymo's lawsuit yet, though it is expected to in the coming weeks. However, according to a Bloomberg report published Thursday, we have an idea one of Uber's potential defenses. According to the report, Levandowski told his staff that Uber's lidar technology is "clean" and that he downloaded those files to his computer so that he could work from home. Uber has only called Waymo's accusations a "baseless attempt to slow down a competitor." Alphabet's ties to Uber There's another piece to the puzzle. Alphabet has made significant investments in Uber. In a strange way, Uber's success also financially benefits Alphabet. In 2013, Google Ventures (now simply called GV), invested $258 million in Uber. That investment, which had Uber valued at $3.5 billion at the time, gave GV about a 7% stake in the company, Kara Swisher reported at the time, writing for AllThingsD. Uber is now valued at approximately $69 billion, according to most estimates. An Alphabet executive, David Drummond, also used to be on Uber's board, but left in August of 2016 once it became clear the two companies were competing in the same space. © Provided by Business Insider Inc david drummond What's next? The next major development will be Uber's legal filing responding to Waymo's lawsuit. The judge in the case has given Uber until April 7 to file, but Uber's lawyer said it's coming within the next two weeks. So far, we don't know much about how Uber will respond, but it seems likely it'll want to use Levandowski's defense that he downloaded the files to his computer so he could work from home.

Microsoft's Open Compute-inspired servers on display at the Open Compute Summit in Santa Clara in March 2017 (Photo: Yevgeniy Sverdlik) DCK, Featured Top Five Data Center Stories: Week of March 18 by Data Center Knowledge  on March 19, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet Here are the top stories that appeared on Data Center Knowledge this week: Why Microsoft Says ARM Chips Can Replace Half of Its Data Center Muscle – This was not an announcement like the ones we’ve heard in the past from Facebook and Google – non-committal revelations that they had been testing ARM servers here and there, and that they were really always testing everything on the market, just in case. Meet Microsoft, the New Face of Open Source Data Center Hardware – If you’re running a cloud platform at Microsoft’s scale (30-plus regions around the world, with multiple data centers per region) and you want it to run on the best data center hardware, you typically design it yourself. But what if there are ideas out there — outside of your company’s bubble — that can make it even better? Google Opens a New Front in Cloud Price Wars – By constantly growing the scale of their data center infrastructure, cloud giants are able to continue lowering prices of their services as they battle for share of the enterprise cloud market. At the Google Cloud Next conference earlier this month in San Francisco Google launched the latest attack in this battle, which at least for now has a good shot at being successful. Atlanta Data Center Market Firing on All Cylinders – The demand for data center space leased from third-party landlords appears to be growing across all segments there, including: colocation and interconnection, enterprise outsourcing, cloud and hybrid IT solutions.

Mohamed Al Hammadi / Crown Prince Court - Abu Dhabi Data scientists are central to the new economy Kent Walker March 19, 2017 Updated: March 19, 2017 04:57 PM Related Abu Dhabi Crown Prince addresses future generations’ majlis - in pictures Sheikh Abdullah addresses Mohammed bin Zayed Majlis for Future Generations - in pictures Abu Dhabi Crown Prince meets ruling families of different emirates Related Abu Dhabi Crown Prince addresses future generations’ majlis - in pictures Sheikh Abdullah addresses Mohammed bin Zayed Majlis for Future Generations - in pictures Abu Dhabi Crown Prince meets ruling families of different emirates I grew up in Silicon Valley where my family settled generations ago and my grandfather worked on a farm and as a machinist. Today, at Google, I spend my workdays writing, speaking and meeting people. My grandfather would not recognise what I do as a job. For him, it would have been a holiday. We should ask ourselves: what will our grandchildren do that we will not recognise as jobs? Two hundred years ago, 97 per cent of people worked in the fields. Then many moved to factories and then to offices. And change continues today with growing use of industrial automation and artificial intelligence. Just as industrialisation changed agriculture and industry, artificial intelligence and machine learning are starting to change office jobs and automating routine tasks. Google’s approach to machine learning is driven by a belief that the benefits of technology should accrue to everyone. The internet has been "the great equaliser". It distributed access to technology and created a frictionless marketplace that empowered both consumers and new companies. With costs continuing to decline, more people around the world now have access to mobile phones than to decent sanitation. Today, a kid in Al Ain using a search engine has the same access to information as the chancellor of Germany or the president of France. On a larger scale, cloud-based services have made advanced IT offerings easier to scale and purchase on demand – making information processing an affordable utility like water or electricity. Now Google is integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning into most of our products: whether you are using Search or YouTube or Translate or Maps you are benefiting from a wealth of machine learning. This widespread access to internet connectivity plus essentially unlimited computing power have, with the acceleration of machine learning and artificial intelligence, led to profound business transformations shaping the future of work. Already, we have jobs such as data scientists in fields that didn’t exist 20 years ago. It would be foolish to think that what we do today represents the end of the process. But it takes an act of imagination to envision the future. With the advent of ATMs in the 1980s, people thought that there would be no more bank tellers. In fact, there are more bank tellers now than there were in 1980. They just do more sophisticated things like helping clients with financial planning and new kinds of services. It’s a great example of how technology displaces tasks, not jobs. A recent survey found that the "best job in the US" in 2017 was that of mobile apps developer – a job that did not exist a few years ago. Software engineers will help design the future of medicine, infrastructure, finance, transportation, stock markets and maybe even music and art. Philosophy, history and the humanities will always be important as we chart this new path. But so will computer science and programming. A recent study by Google shows that computer science and programming skills are critical to the UAE's digital economy plans. At the heart of every organisation, there will be need to be data scientists who understand how to program the business for success. Beyond educational change, cultures need to evolve as well. It seems counter-intuitive, but you want young people to take a chance on a cool new thing, not just hope for a safe job with the government or a large company. You need to promote a culture of risk and reward, and a legal system that accepts that sometimes people will try and fail. No other place in the world has witnessed more failures than Silicon Valley. These failures constitute the fertiliser that led a subsequent generation of Silicon Valley start-ups to create perhaps more value than any other place in history. The governments in this region can adopt other policies that will directly contribute to the rise of the knowledge economy and benefit both businesses and citizens. Promoting a start-up ecosystem, letting successful companies share economic rewards with their employees, avoiding red tape, burdensome licensing rules and limits on trade, and giving ready access to government data can all help entrepreneurs grow new markets. I feel fortunate to be living in a time when technology has the potential to fundamentally improve the way people work, learn and live – no matter who they are, where they are or what they do. History has shown us that technological progress leads to greater prosperity, more jobs, safer workplaces and higher standards of living. It’s up to all of us – tech companies, governments, business and citizens – to work together to create the conditions that allow innovation to flourish. The UAE has been a leader in many aspects in the region. Social and economic developments that would have seemed hard to imagine 50 years ago are today a reality through vision and a relentless desire to achieve results. But more than ever before, governments must prepare for the future. Technological change means that leaders must constantly re-evaluate how to foster the right policy environment. We look to the UAE to rise to the challenge to become as much of a regional and global leader in the hyper-connected digital age as it has been in the bricks-and-mortar economy.

Robert Epstein, a former editor in chief of Psychology Today and co-founder of a behavioral research institute in California, has won several converts through a series of experiments since first raising his concerns in 2013. Though Google has challenged his research, Epstein’s latest initiative includes the public support of 12 academics in four countries, from institutions as Stanford University, the University of Maryland and the University of Amsterdam. The global monitoring system Epstein envisions, called the Sunlight Society, would involve people from various nations conducting searches and transmitting the resulting rankings and links to a central office, where they could be analyzed for signs of bias. This would resemble a system that Epstein and several colleagues used to track alleged bias throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, during which they recruited 95 monitors in 24 states who ultimately captured more than 13,000 sets of search rankings and the 98,000 pages to which they linked. In that election, Epstein said searches related to the election were more likely to produce links to web pages offering a favorable impression of Hillary Clinton than of Donald Trump. Epstein, who is trying to raise $2 million to support the project, offered no evidence of intentional manipulation. He said the goal of the Sunlight Society was “to detect, to study and to expose new technologies that threaten human freedom.” Three of the 12 academics publicly supporting the Sunlight Society, when contacted by The Washington Post, said they were uncertain about the sources of bias but favored creating a group for studying the issue because search engines had become dominant sources of online information. Results often vary from person to person based on location and other factors, often including browser and search history. “One of the questions we are still grappling with is, where is the bias coming from?” said one of Epstein’s supporters, Natali Helberger, a professor of information law at the University of Amsterdam. “Part of this bias is probably in ourselves.” Google dismissed Epstein’s research as “nothing more than a poorly constructed conspiracy theory.” “We have never re-ranked search results on any topic (including elections) to manipulate political sentiment,” the company said in the statement to The Washington Post. “Moreover, we do not make any ranking tweaks that are specific to elections or political candidates, period. We always strive to provide our users with the most accurate, relevant answers to their queries.” Microsoft, which operates the Bing search engine, and Yahoo declined to comment. The importance of search rankings — and especially their order as they appear on the screen of a device — is well established when it comes to how consumers select online shopping offers, websites or news stories. Epstein summarized research into the impact of search results on political behavior in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2015. University of Maryland law professor Frank Pasquale, who in 2007 publicly raised the possibility of a “Federal Search Commission” to monitor the increasingly powerful effects of search engines, said a monitoring group is a valuable step. “It’s part of an ecosystem of accountability,” said Pasquale, who is a public supporter of Epstein’s project. Dennis Allison, a lecturer at Stanford’s Computer Systems Laboratory and a supporter of Epstein’s project, also called the study of bias in new technologies important. “The source of that bias has not been established as far as I can see but likely is present,” he said.

The Google powered video streaming platform has rolled the new mobile live streaming feature to creators with more than 10,000 subscribers. Creators who have a subscriber base less than 10k will also get the feature soon. The live streaming feature is built right into the YouTube mobile app. To start streaming a video, users just need to open the YouTube app, hit the capture button to start recording the video that will go live for their subscriber base. Google blog mentioned that the streamed videos will have all the same features as regular YouTube videos. As noted, the live streaming of video through computers was first available in the year 2011. Photo Credit: Giphy Besides, to help creators earn revenue from live streaming, the video streaming platform has also launched Super Chat, a live stream monetization tool available to creators in more than 20 countries and viewers in more than 40 countries. SEE ALSO: Bored of YouTube? Here are a few alternative video streaming sites Google says that Super Chat lets any fan watching a live stream stand out from the crowd and get a creator's attention by purchasing chat messages that are highlighted in bright colors and stay pinned to the top of the chat window for up to five hours. It's a pretty neat idea that will give viewers a chance to add a little visual flair to their chats and at the same time will allow creators to keep connected to their fans while earning a little money. It is worth mentioning that Google has slowed down live chat during the video stream on the YouTube Mobile app as receiving 2,000 messages per second is little too fast. Besides, Google blog also mentions that the team has worked on improving streaming quality across a wider range of devices. YouTube's Mobile Live streaming app will compete with the Facebook's popular live feature that allows users to stream live videos on their time-line. Whereas the Super chat feature is Google's take on Twitter's Periscope.

Anyhow, the company hasn't revealed how many Redmi Note 3 units were available today for the flash sale. #9 Bengaluru-based computer hacker Anand Prakash has been awarded Rs. 10 lakh for finding a bug on the social website Facebook;s login system. This bug if not handled, could let the hackers access a user's messages, photos and even debit/credit card details as well. In fact, Anand has sent the bug report to Facebook security team on February 22 and received a mail about the reward on March 2. #10 Itseems its time for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) to take over! In the latest update, AlphaGo, a program developed by Google's DeepMind unit, has defeated Go player Lee Se-dol in the first of five historic matches held in Seoul. Lee gave up after about three and a half hours, with 28 minutes and 28 seconds remaining on his clock.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor Google Could Release a Third Phone This Year – Rumored to Be Bigger Than Pixel XL By Rafia Shaikh Mar 15, 2017 15Shares Share Tweet Submit (Concept image) Device may release along with Pixel and Pixel XL successors later this year Whoa, Google! Yes, we all wanted you to start making your own phones, but three Pixel “phones” already? Well, it’s Google, after all. Yesterday, a report from the folks at 9to5google suggested that it was “confirmed” that Google was using “walleye” and “muskie” as codenames for the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2, respectively. Following this, a new report published today not only corroborates these codenames but also adds that Google is working on a third phone and it’s not the Google Pixel 2. A bigger Google Pixel 2 or a more ambitious, premium phone? A new report claims that Google is now working on a third device under codename “taimen”. The report was published by Droid-Life, saying that this information comes from “multiple sources”. However, no other details are available at the moment. Related Would You Spend the Extra Money to Get the Samsung DeX Dock for Your Galaxy S8? [Poll] Now, Google is fond of aquatic life and has always been taking inspiration from the water to codename its devices. A simple Google Image search shows that taimen is quite a huge fish – by huge, we mean it was shown to be carried by at least two people in most of the images. Advertisement The size of the fish may actually hint that the third Pixel phone is going to be larger than the Pixel XL. While you may think that this could be a tablet, Droid-Life’s sources are adamant that this is indeed a “phone”. Considering how big Pixel XL is, taimen could move to the 6-inch category, similar to Nexus 6 which – on a side, but relevant note – was codenamed Shamu, another fat fish. Related Three New Galaxy S8 Colors Expected to Be Part of Smartphone’s Announcement This Month Right now, with no more details except for the codename, it is unclear whether taimen will be just a larger sibling of Google Pixel 2 or a completely new phone, with its own unique branding. As more rumors start to pour in, we would hopefully get to know if taimen is something more premium than the upcoming Google Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2. For now, all we know is that the Mountain View search giant is working on a third device, at least according to this one report. We will share more updates on this, but don’t forget to share with us if you’ll be interested in a bigger and probably more expensive Google Pixel successor?

Varma Google pulled its search engine out of mainland China in 2010 and established in Hong Kong after a bitter spat with Beijing over its strict censorship rules. Photo: Bloomberg Beijing: China and Google are in talks for the Internet giant’s return to the Chinese mainland after it was pulled out seven years ago following a bitter spat with Beijing over censorship rules. “China has been in touch with Google through various channels. Last year, leaders of our country’s important department had further communication with Google,” Liu Binjie, a standing committee member of China’s Parliament the National People’s Congress and former head of the General Administration of Press and Publication said. Currently Google search engine as well other services, including email services are blocked in China and they can be accessed only with VPNs, (virtual private network). Google Scholar, a search engine for scholarly literature, was among the services on Beijing’s priority list for re-entry, Liu was quoted as saying by Hong Kong-based the South China Morning Post on Sunday. ALSO READ: Google’s Project Loon loses CEO after about six months There was hope that a part of Google’s business would return to China first, gradually followed by others, Liu said. “The academic sector will be the first to get through. China’s focus is on (making) academic progress, such as academic exchanges as well as (exchanges in) science and culture, instead of news, information or politics,” he said. Other Google functions under negotiation included “service functions that do not involve (politically) sensitive information,” the lawmaker said. But no timetable had yet been set for Google’s return, he said. Google pulled its search engine out of mainland China in 2010 and established in Hong Kong after a bitter spat with Beijing over its strict censorship rules. However, with 721 million web users, China the world’s biggest Internet market remained an attractive destination for Google but Beijing’s rigid firewall web system with stringent controls remained a concern. In the absence of Google, Chinese language Internet search engines like Baidu prospered. Microsoft’s Bing too tried to make inroads in China. PTI K.J.M.

Photo: Reuters San Francisco: With the broad release of Google Assistant last week, the voice-assistant wars are in full swing, with Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Corp and now Alphabet Inc’s Google all offering electronic assistants to take your commands. Siri is the oldest of the bunch, and researchers including Oren Etzioni, chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, said Apple has squandered its lead when it comes to understanding speech and answering questions. But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localized for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the United States. ALSO READ: Artificial intelligence is already all around us: John MacIntyre Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon’s Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai. The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say “two-nil” instead of “two-nothing.” At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customize Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children’s book author writes Cortana’s lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries. “They really pride themselves on what’s truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican,” said Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, a language model is built that tries to predict words sequences. ALSO READ: Google acquires Kaggle in boost to data play Then Apple deploys “dictation mode,” its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks. But script-writing does not scale, said Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Ozlo. “You can’t hire enough writers to come up with the system you’d need in every language. You have to synthesize the answers,” he said. That is years off, he said. The founders of Viv, a start-up founded by Siri’s original creators that Samsung acquired last year, is working on just that. “Viv was built to specifically address the scaling issue for intelligent assistants,” said Dag Kittlaus, the CEO and co-founder of Viv. “The only way to leapfrog today’s limited functionality versions is to open the system up and let the world teach them.”Reuters Stephen Nellis Topics: Apple Siri Shanghainese Google Assistant voice assistants More From Livemint READ MORE ‘Unhappy’ Modi asks BJP MPs to ensure presence in Parliament Airtel hits back at Reliance Jio on speed ad with Ookla backing Media and entertainment industry likely to grow at 14% by 2021: Report First Published: Thu, Mar 09 2017. 03 22 PM IST Editor's Picks Idea, Vodafone sign off on ‘equal’ merger in India India seeks to jump 40 places in World Bank’s Doing Business rankings The Yogi Adityanath development model Latest News ‘Unhappy’ Modi asks BJP MPs to ensure presence in Parliament Airtel hits back at Reliance Jio on speed ad with Ookla backing Media and entertainment industry likely to grow at 14% by 2021: Report 53% of Indian professionals use technology for hiring: Survey Idea Cellular shares extend fall, down nearly 8% on Vodafone deal Mint On Sunday Rape laws: A call for change Where now are the bindis of yesteryear?

Explore more:  facebook google amazon virtual assistants The Rise of Virtual Assistants, and the Evolution of Search and Discovery March 17, 2017 Andrew Hutchinson Virtual assistant tools are on the rise in social, with Facebook adding them into Messenger (via ‘M’, Bots and smart tips) and Google integrating them within their new Allo messaging app. These additional functionalities make sense – Facebook and Google, with their increasingly advanced AI systems, are learning more and more about our individual likes and interests, context for what we’ll likely go searching for in future. Given the amount of collective insight and knowledge these systems now have, there could come a time where they’ll even reliably be able to recommend what you need before you even know you need it. Such innovations are also being enhanced by the rise of another type of virtual assistant - those being added into your home via devices like Google Home and Amazon’s Echo. Already, more than five million Amazon Echo units have been sold, and 3.5 million Google Home units activated, and those numbers are expected to increase to around 24 million assistant devices in homes by the end of 2017. It’s important to recognize that these functionalities are all connected. Not technically, of course - they all serve very different purposes and utilize totally different systems. But habitually, these systems are training users to change their expectations on search and discovery, we’re learning to expect these systems to know us, to learn our behaviors and needs, and to provide relevant recommendations with less manual input at each turn. That shift is a significant change in search behavior, and it could have major implications for marketers moving forward. And this week, we’ve seen reports of a new development on this front, with the first paid ads delivered via Google Home. New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO — brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 The ad's a bit clumsy, a bit forced into the interaction, but it’s a first step, a first move by Google to monetize this new discovery process. It may seem like nothing, an obvious move - of course they’ll be looking to push in ad content - but it’s worthy of note in that it raises the consideration of how these new assistant tools are going to change the game, both in digital marketing and in SEO. For example, using Google Assistant in Google Allo, you can now seek recommendations for, say, a restaurant to meet at during any interaction. As you can see in the example, the query posted within the conversation is ‘sushi restaurants nearby’. Those types of conversational queries around going to become more important – which is relevant from an SEO perspective (considering the language people use when searching), but more than that, it’ll also mean these systems are in charge of delivering relevant results. What if you could pay to ensure your business came up as a relevant query? What if this becomes a whole new means of outreach? The arrival of ads on Google Home shows that they’re exploring their ad opportunities, which could well extend to search recommendations and direct links to ordering options. Here’s another example, this time within Facebook Messenger. As you can see, there are now automated prompts showing up for some users (in test mode) to set a reminder for an event, based on machine learning systems which have ‘read’ the context of your message. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has noted their development of such tools - more importantly for detection of abuse and dangerous behavior, but still, the same process can be used to provide immediate, direct prompts, like this, based on message context. Now imagine if that prompt didn’t say ‘Set Reminder’, but instead it said ‘Place Order’. With more payment options being added to Messenger, and similar, immediate pay options being built into home devices, such prompts will become more common. And if there’s a way for your business to tap into those recommendations and become the preferred source, that could present a significant opportunity. As noted, such developments have the potential to change search and discovery as we know it. We’re still in the early stages of this shift – Facebook's only testing out these tools and Google Assistant is still ironing out the kinks (a recent error made elements your Google search history accessible to others on a chat thread). But it’s important to consider the wider implications of the new behaviors being learned, and how that’s going to change the marketing process. Tools are being developed to streamline the buying process, to make it more immediate, easier for users to simply place an order for something while it’s top of mind, even have systems detect needs and order on your behalf. And with that new world will come a new range of marketing and outreach opportunities. Some will see significant benefit from this, especially those that get in early and work with these new processes. Others will lose out as a result. It’s worth paying attention as these elements evolve to ensure your brand is at the forefront.   Author Information Andrew Hutchinson Writer/Moderator @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Meet the man unlocking Google to help rural businesses grow 2017-03-19 12:18 - Kyle Venktess, Fin24 Post a comment 0 share: Anorth Mabunda RELATED ARTICLES Fighting fake news isn't just up to Facebook and Google SEE: Sponsored Google advert slams Pravin Gordhan Google employees rally in thousands against Trump immigration ban Johannesburg - Changing the world one individual at a time. This is what Google is seemingly achieving with its Digital Skills for Africa programme where at least one South African is using his newly acquired digital skills to train others. Google recently announced that it had managed to surpass its target of training one million Africans through the programme in less than a year. Since then, Anorth Mabunda, from Limpopo has stepped forward to use his skills to help people in rural communities realise their dreams by understanding what digital is and how it works. Mabunda told Fin24 that after completing the programme, he realised that there were numerous residents in his community who had a smartphone or another device, but did not even know what it was capable of doing and how it could assist them in attaining a career in digital. “People from rural communities don’t even know there is a job called something like a social media manager,” he said.  READ: Speed of AI advancements 'surprise' Google co-founder Mabunda said that the turning-point in his career came when he realised how difficult it had become to sustain a career in the print advertising industry.  “I saw that the digital skills for Africa programme was available from Google and I knew I needed to get skills in digital to sustain a career in the future,” Mabunda told Fin24.  After he had completed the course, he began to notice how many people could benefit from the programme and began to approach companies in rural townships to assist in building an online identity for them.  Mabunda is now a Digital Skills Trainer for OneAfrica.Online, a digital skills project in the Southern African region supported by Google. He relates: “I met a man in Soweto who had been running a small video production company. We Googled ‘video production’ and ‘Soweto’ and his website didn’t appear on Google. We found it was because his site was poorly designed. We are now working on the website to give him a better presence and to grow his business,” Mabunda said. READ: Google employees rally in thousands against Trump immigration ban He said he likes to see himself as a humanitarian who wants to help people in rural communities grow their businesses through the internet. “I try to approach places where there are people gathered in crowds - like at churches and universities - to teach them how digital can help them in their business.” South Africa saw the least amount of users for the Digital Skills project, among three geographic focus regions, as the country notched up just 70 000 users.  Meanwhile Nigeria saw over 450 000 users trained, Kenya had over 400 000 users, and 80 000 were trained collectively in other countries in Africa. Google SA said that key to the programme’s success was partnerships, of which governments in the rest of Africa participated more in.  The Digital Skills programme offers 89 courses through the online g.co/digitalskills portal, and Google works with 14 training partners covering more than 20 countries to offer face-to-face training.  Follow @KyleVenktess Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Read more about: google  |  skills development  |  rural development share: More In This Category INFOGRAPHIC: Why Cape Town is SA's fintech hub Uber president Jones quits amid turmoil and search for COO Secrets from smart devices find path to legal system Mark Barnes: Post Bank could manage Sassa better and cheaper Most Popular Read One week before Samsung S8 arrives - in three colours INFOGRAPHIC: Why Cape Town is SA's fintech hub Uber president Jones quits amid turmoil and search for COO Secrets from smart devices find path to legal system #BillShock: R188 000 in one day Contact us   |   About Us   |   Terms & Conditions NEWS24  |   OLX  |   PROPERTY24  |   CAREERS24  |   SPREE  |

Google is now letting its human "quality raters" flag content that is "upsetting" or "offensive" in search results. The quality raters can flag such content, and while this does not directly affect the search results themselves, it serves to teach the company’s algorithms to surface better results when users search for something. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) NEW YORK — Google is trying to improve the quality of its search results by directing review teams to flag content that might come across as upsetting or offensive. With the change, content with racial slurs could now get flagged under a new category called “upsetting-offensive.” So could content that promotes hate or violence against a specific group of people based on gender, race or other criteria. While flagging something doesn’t directly affect the search results themselves, it’s used to tweak the company’s software so that better content ranks higher. This approach might, for instance, push down content that is inaccurate or has other questionable attributes, thereby giving prominence to trustworthy sources. The review teams — comprised of contractors known as “quality raters” — already comb through websites and other content to flag questionable items such as pornography. Google added “upsetting-offensive” in its latest guidelines for quality raters. Google declined to comment on the changes, which were reported in the blog Search Engine Land and elsewhere. The guidelines , which run 160 pages, are an interesting look into how Google ranks the quality of its search results. For instance, it gives examples of “high-quality” pages, such as the home page of a newspaper that has “won seven Pulitzer Prize awards,” and “low-quality” pages, such as an article that includes “many grammar and punctuation errors.” The guidelines cite an example of “Holocaust history” as a search query. A resulting website listing “Top 10 reasons why the holocaust didn’t happen” would get flagged. The new “upsetting-offensive” flag instructs quality raters to “flag to all web results that contain upsetting or offensive content from the perspective of users in your locale, even if the result satisfies the user intent.” So even if the results are what the person searched for, such as white supremacist websites, they could still get flagged. But it doesn’t mean the results won’t show up at all when someone searches for them. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

These apps let you easily find duplicate contacts on your Android phone and then remove duplicates with just a few taps. You can simply open up these apps and then choose the sources from which you want to remove duplicate contacts. After that, these apps will scan through your contacts list and show all the duplicate contacts. You can then simply go ahead and remove them from your phone. Some of these apps even allow you to merge duplicate contacts with the original ones instead of deleting them. If you’re using an iPhone and looking for a way to find and remove duplicate contacts, then you can check out our post on 5 Free iPhone Apps To Find Duplicate Contacts. Sponsored Links The Android smartphones import contacts from various sources like your phone storage, SIM, contact backups, social accounts, Google accounts, etc. This can sync the same contact multiple times in your phonebook and occasionally you end up having your phonebook bombarded with duplicate contacts. And, if you want to remove the duplicate contacts manually, then it might take a hell lot of time to do so. But, thanks to duplicate contacts remover apps for Android you can now quickly find and get rid of all the duplicate contacts instantly. In this post, I have listed 5 of the simplest and effective duplicate contacts remover apps for Android. Now, let us get started with the apps and see how they can help you find and remove duplicate contacts. Contact Optimizer: Contacts Optimizer is probably one of the best free duplicate contacts remover app for Android. Using this app, you can easily find and remove all the duplicate contacts which are stored on your Google accounts, phone storage, SIM, etc. After you open up the app, you can go ahead and choose any of the accounts (like your Gmail account, phone, SIM, etc.) on which you want to find duplicate contacts. Then you can simply hit the “Tap to Find Duplicates” button to make this app find all the duplicate contacts on the selected account. Once the app is done finding the duplicate contacts, you can remove them with a single touch on the “Delete Duplicates” button. Before removing duplicate contacts, it even allows you to preview the contacts and uncheck any of them if you need to. The duplicate contacts remover feature is completely free to use. The free version of Contacts Optimizer also lets you edit contacts, move/copy them to other accounts, and add new contacts to any account you want. There are many other features offered by this app in the paid version using which you can find similar contacts, merge contacts, correct invalid contacts, and more. Duplicate Contacts and Utilities: Duplicate Contacts and Utilities is also one of the effective duplicate contacts remover apps for Android. It lets you easily find duplicates on your phone and then remove them permanently. To find duplicates, all you need to do is open the app and then it will automatically start finding the duplicate contacts. After finding the duplicate contacts, it categorizes them into “Same to Same Duplicates”, “Same Name Duplicates”, and “Same Number Duplicates”. You can then explore all the categories and then remove the duplicate contacts by pressing the “Delete Duplicates” button. It does allow you to see all the duplicate contacts before you delete them, but there is no option to deselect any duplicate contacts. Apart from searching for duplicate contacts, it also finds the “Junk Email Contacts” and “No-Number Contacts” on your phone. You can browse these unnecessary (junk email and no-number) contacts on the main screen and remove them to declutter your Android phonebook. This app also offers other utilities like contacts exporter, contacts importer, etc. The “merge Contacts” feature is only available in the paid version of this app. Duplicate Contacts Remover (by Kathos): Duplicate Contacts Remover (by Kathos) is another useful duplicate contacts remover app using which you can quickly find and remove duplicate contacts on your Android phone. The best part about this app is that as soon as you open it up, it will automatically start scanning for duplicate contacts. Unlike the “Contacts Optimizer” app, you don’t need to select the source of the contacts as this app searches all your accounts including phone storage, Google accounts, and more for duplicates. Once it finds the duplicate contacts, it will list them all on the main screen such that you can confirm duplicity and exclude contacts if required before removing them. When you’re all set, you can press the “Delete Selected” button and all the duplicate contacts will be deleted from your Android phone. You can use this app to find and remove duplicate contacts without paying a single penny. Apart from letting your remove duplicates, it also comes with additional features like backup contacts, restore contacts, etc. To help you easily check and confirm the duplicate contacts, it also lets you sort the contacts by name or number. Duplicate Contacts Remover (by C94dev): Duplicate Contacts Remover (by C94dev) is another simple free duplicate contacts remover apps for Android. It is quite similar to the “Duplicate Contacts Remover (by Kathos)” app and helps you find and delete duplicate contacts instantly. This app also doesn’t require you to choose the accounts from which you want to find or remove the duplicates. When you open this app on your Android phone, it will automatically search for the duplicate contacts in your phone storage, SIM, and even Google accounts. After the app is done scanning all the contacts, it will list all the duplicate contacts on the main screen, You can simply go through all the duplicates and make a selection for the contacts which you want to remove and uncheck the contacts which you want to keep on your phone. To remove the duplicate contacts, all you got to do is tap on the “Delete Selected” option visible at the top of the main screen. You can also use this app to backup all your contacts to your phone storage and recover them whenever you want using this app. To easily inspect the duplicity, this app lets you sort the result by name or by number. Duplicate Contact Merger: Duplicate Contact Merger is another simple and effective app that can be used to easily search for duplicate contacts on your Android phone. Instead of directly removing the duplicate contacts, it actually merges the duplicate contacts with the original contacts. You can simply launch this app and then go to the “Manage” tab to select the accounts from which you want to find the duplicates. It lets you choose all your accounts or select specific accounts like phone storage, Google account, etc. When you’re done selecting the accounts, it will go through the entire contacts list and find the duplicate contacts. One of the unique features of this app is that after finding the duplicates it sorts them by various categories like Duplicate Contacts, Duplicate Phones, Duplicate Emails, Similar Names, etc. After that, you can simply browse any of the categories and then select the duplicates to merge them together. To merge, you need to simply tap on the “Merger” icon at the top. As soon as you do that, it will remove the duplicates by merging the information of duplicate contacts with the original contacts. This app also comes with the options to backup and restore contacts. Another interesting feature of this app is that it shows unused contacts such that you can delete them from your phone. Closing Words: If you want to get rid of duplicate contacts on your Android phone, then go ahead and start using any of the duplicate contacts remover apps explained in this post. Personally, I like “Contacts Organizer” as it comes with a clean interface and is very easy to use. But, if we talk about decluttering your Android phonebook properly then using “Duplicate Contacts & Utilities” app would probably be the best choice for you.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple joins Google, other tech companies in resisting ‘troubling’ FBI search warrant Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, March 15th, 2017, 05:32 Category: Amazon, Apple, Google, iOS, Legal, Microsoft, News, security Apple has joined Amazon and Microsoft in a court filing which supports Google’s decision to resist an FBI warrant demanding that it hand over emails stored outside the USA. The tech companies argue that this would set a ‘troubling’ precedent. As reported, the FBI served search warrants ordering Google to surrender emails belonging to suspects in a criminal investigation. The emails themselves were stored on a server outside the USA. Google, in turn, refused, arguing that a domestic search warrant could not apply to data stored in a foreign country. A Pennsylvania court both disagreed and instructed Google to comply with the warrant. Google has since appealed the ruling, with Apple, Amazon and Microsoft jointly filing an amicus brief in support of Google. The filing does not suggest that the government is necessarily wrong to seek to extend the law to data stored overseas, but rather argues that the current law does not permit this, and it is for Congress – and not the courts – to make this call. The brief also offers the following comment: This case addresses the reach of the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq., which Congress enacted as part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. Technology has changed dramatically since the SCA became law. The Congress that drafted the SCA could barely have imagined the notion of storing emails halfway across the globe. That is why companies, commentators, and privacy advocates alike have long called for the SCA to be updated in light of the realities of 21st century technology. The question here, however, is the scope of the SCA as it now stands, not as Congress might eventually revise it. The tech companies have argued that Congress should carefully consider the implications of how it applies U.S. search warrants to data held in other countries. More than a year ago, Apple resisted the FBI itself in the San Bernardino shooting case, refusing to create a weakened version of iOS that would allow access to an iPhone – and Google filed an amicus brief supporting Apple in that case. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Users of Google search in Finland and India are being delivered with the Doodle. Canth manned a clothing shop after the death of her husband, and brought up seven children on her own. Canth highlighted social issues in her literary works. Työmiehen vaimo was a story about the wife of an alcoholic who is unable to prevent her husband from spending all his money on drinks, as the money legally belonged to him. Although the work caused a scandal when first released, property laws were changed in Finland as a result of it. Anna Liisa is the tragedy of a fifteen year old girl who gets blackmailed for an abortion, but confesses rather than succumb to threats. Canth was a journalist, and wrote stories for newspapers, and even went on to publish her own newspaper called Wapaita Aatteita. She was one of the few people who chose to write in Finnish rather than Swedish, which increased the visibility of the language globally. As a result of her writings, Finland became the first country in Europe to allow women to vote in 1906. Just a year later, in 1907, Finland became the first country in the world to elect women to the parliament. Finland celebrates her legacy every year as the Day of Equality.

French daily Le Monde says it is one of eight media organizations working with social networking site Facebook to fact-check questionable content ahead of France's upcoming presidential election. At the same time, non-profit First Draft News said Monday it was working with Google's News Lab is to launch CrossCheck , a verification project aimed at helping French voters "make sense of what and who to trust online." Google and Facebook have been under increasing scrutiny over their role in speeding the spread of hoaxes, conspiracy theories and propaganda — sometimes referred to by the catchall term "fake news." There's an argument that fake news helped secure the victory of Donald Trump, whose false allegations about former President Barack Obama helped lay the foundation for his own run for high office. Recent research has questioned the impact of propaganda and hoaxes, but with France's election only two-and-a-half months away, media-watchers here are anxious to avoid a rerun. "We'll see a real wave of fake news in the coming days," said Alain Rabatel, a professor of linguistics at the University of Lyon 1 who has written about fact-checking in French journalism. Le Monde said Monday that its collaboration was "an experiment," noting that the French media were leery of participating in a stunt to help burnish Silicon Valley firms' reputations — and that remuneration would have to be discussed if the project kept going. In a telephone interview, Rabatel had guarded praise, saying journalists had to be more than just fact-checkers. "I think it's good," he said. "It's not sufficient." © Copyright 2017 Prince George Citizen Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

Team members from left to right are Bill Rogers, Hiyab Alemgesed, Michael Margraf and T.J. Tierney.  TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE Since launching in New Zealand in 2013, balloons from Google X’s Project Loon have traveled nearly 12 million miles. MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) — For its next trick, an Internet-beaming balloon factory spun out of Google believes it can outmaneuver the wind. In doing so, the 4-year-old “Project Loon” says it will be able to bring remote parts of the world online more quickly with a smaller fleet of the balloons than it previously thought. Engineers involved in the eccentric project, a part of the X Lab owned by Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc., say they have come up with algorithms that enable the high-flying balloons to do a better job anticipating shifting wind conditions so they hover above masses of land for several months instead of orbiting the Earth. X now expects to need fewer balloons to fulfill its goal of delivering Internet service to billions of people living in unconnected regions in the world, ranging from small villages in Africa to the woods of California. The need for fewer balloons should lower Project Loon’s costs and accelerate plans to start selling Internet-services subscriptions to consumers and businesses. The X lab, like other parts of Alphabet that are funded by Google’s highly profitable digital advertising network, is under pressure to start making money on its own. The Alphabet subsidiaries operating outside Google, a hodgepodge of far-flung projects, have lost a combined $7.1 billion during the past two years. In an acknowledgment of their lofty goals and risky nature, Alphabet CEO Larry Page calls them “moonshots.” Astro Teller, who runs the X Lab, declined to provide a specific timetable for when Project Loon might start selling Internet access plans. Meeting with reporters recently at X’s headquarters in a former shopping mall in Mountain View, California, Teller said the project hopes to team up with a telecommunications provider within the next few months to begin testing how well the balloons’ new navigational system will work. He likened the newly developed algorithms’ objectives to “a game of chess with the wind.” If the algorithms prevail in their meteorological battle, Project Loon hopes to need only 10 to 30 balloons floating about 60,000 feet above the Earth to transmit high-speed Internet signals to a target market, instead of up to 400 balloons orbiting around the globe. Keeping the balloons in smaller clusters will also make them easier to locate and retrieve once they descend back to land after several months in the stratosphere, Teller said. Project Loon has been doing most of its testing recently in South America, although Teller said that isn’t necessarily where it will team up with a telecommunications provider to determine the effectiveness of its wind-defying technology. Since launching in New Zealand in 2013, the balloons have traveled nearly 12 million miles, according to Project Loon. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

That’s fairly typical of Google products; some are wildly successful, while others, like Google+ and the Google Nexus, barely make it off the pad. Now, according to a report from Engadget, Google Home users have picked up on what they’re calling ads – while Google denies the accusation, countering that it’s “timely content.” The alleged ad in question was first spotted by Google Home user and redditor CaptainCaptioni. He got out of bed, started getting ready for work, and said, “Ok Google, good morning,” as he now does every morning as part of his routine. Google Home responds by giving him the time and the weather forecast, as it always does. But then it started talking about Disney’s latest film. “By the way, Disney’s live action Beauty and the Beast opens today. In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer if you ask me. For some more movie fun, ask me something about Belle.” CaptainCaptioni added that he had not previously searched for the film and it didn’t reflect his interests. And he wasn’t the only one. Bryson Meunier of Search Engine Land took to Twitter with a clip of his Google Home speaking the “ad” and mentioned that the “Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home.” Other Home users noted similar experiences, typically without ever having shown any interest in the movie before. When reached for comment, a Google spokesperson replied that it wasn’t an ad. It was, rather, a “feature” called My Day. “This wasn’t intended to be an ad. What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case. “The beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales.” In fairness, previous “timely content” has come up on Google Home without prompting. But that content was related to Black History Month and the Oscars. Many are calling foul, claiming that they didn’t pay $130 to be advertised to. Google Home’s list of features did not include ‘timely advertisements for Disney.’ [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] And according to a report from BBC, the “ad” has since disappeared without a trace. Ben Wood, an analyst from CCS Insight, noted that Google faces a “tricky” situation with the Home, as unlike competitor Amazon, their primary business model is predicated on advertising. The risk, he said, is that unlike Google’s other forms of advertising, audio ads can be incredibly intrusive. “For Amazon its about transactional revenue where a voice assistant like Echo can help drive sales.” That’s a model that Amazon already has some experience with. While it has ultimately been a bit of a failure, Amazon released the Amazon Dash Button in 2015 – a simple one-press button which could be pressed to reorder specific products, through Amazon, of course. The concept is to order simple household products – like Tide detergent, Maxwell House coffee, Bounty paper towels, Cottonelle toilet paper – with the press of a single button which could be placed anywhere near the product. For a certain segment of the population, it’s a great idea. Everyone has forgotten to purchase essentials at one time or another and regretted it. The Dash Button is still available, but never really took off – but it could almost be seen as a practice run for a similar feature on the Echo. That feature hasn’t materialized yet, but it’s pretty much inevitable. And when it comes to monetization, Google has nothing comparable; they’re a company built on ad revenue and market data. And Google has to find ways to keep the Home competitive, as new challengers inevitably appear. [Image by Ethan Miller/Getty Images] Whether intentional or not, ads are out for Google Home – for now. But don’t be too surprised if they start sneaking back in. [Featured Image by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images] Now Read This: iPad Pro 2 Release Date: Four New iPads Coming Next Week?

Phones by Taylor Martin March 16, 2017 6:45 AM PDT @caspertek You now have a new way to split the bill for dinner: Gmail for Android. While the ability to send money using Google Wallet has been available for quite a while in Gmail on the web, you can now send money from within the mobile app. Once you've received the latest update, you'll be able to send and request money within the email compose screen. This feature is not currently available outside the US or for Gmail for iOS. Taylor Martin/CNET To send or request money in Gmail for Android: Open Gmail and tap the compose button in the bottom right corner. Tap the paper clip button in the upper right corner. In the dropdown menu, select Send money or Request money. Enter a dollar amount and hit Continue. If you don't yet have a payment method set up in your Google Wallet account, you'll be prompted to add a debit card before proceeding. Tap Add Debit Card, enter all the required information and tap Save. Add a memo for what the payment is for, such as coffee, pizza or rent. Tap Attach Money. Since this is just an attachment to an email, you can add a recipient, subject and message in the email body either before or after attaching the payment or money request. The recipient doesn't need to be a Gmail user or have a Google Wallet account to receive funds. Taylor Martin/CNET Money sent to a Gmail address will be deposited directly into the recipient's Google Wallet account. Google says that those without a Gmail account will have the option to have the funds transferred straight to their bank account, free of charge. After the email has been sent, you and the recipient will both receive an email confirmation from Google Wallet containing the amount, the payment method, the recipient, the memo and the transaction ID.

Michael Nagle / Bloomberg The bitter truth about Big Data Robert Matthews March 19, 2017 Updated: March 19, 2017 08:47 AM Related From policing to news, how algorithms are changing our lives It’s what every investor has dreamed of: a way of predicting stock market moves. And according to researchers in the UK, it’s easier than you’d think. Changes in the US Dow Jones index are presaged by the ebb and flow of Google searches for certain financial keywords. Better still, acting on these trends could make you a huge profit – at least, until others find the same keywords, of course. Predictably, publication of this claim in the journal Nature Scientific Reports attracted a lot of attention. It was also hailed as evidence of the power of so-called Big Data: the extraction of insight from datasets. Now it looks set to become a classic example of what Big Data can do – but not in a good way. An analysis of the claim published this month suggests it is an object lesson in how digging into Big Data can trigger an avalanche of dross. With everyone from politicians to billion-dollar corporations looking to Big Data for answers to big questions, it holds vital lessons for all of us. And topping the list is: never let go of common sense. When it first began to make headlines around a decade ago, the exploitation of Big Data was hailed as nothing short of a revolution in how we can make sense of the world. In the face of so much information, there was simply no reason to bother dreaming up intricate theories and then testing them. "Out with every theory of human behaviour, from linguistics to sociology. Forget taxonomy, ontology and psychology," wrote Chris Anderson, editor-in-chief of Wired. "With enough data, the numbers speak for themselves." At last month’s World Government Summit in Dubai, the potential of Big Data was held up as the means to solve a host of problems, from delivering local public services to tackling global food security. But now many of those who have looked to Big Data for insight have found that when left to "speak for themselves", numbers often spout gibberish. Take that claim that Google search data can predict stock market moves. The idea isn’t so crazy: market swings reflect changes in sentiment among investors, and these might well show up as changes in the volume of searches for certain financial terms. But which ones? In their Nature Science Reports study, the researchers came up with a list of about 100 terms they thought might pop up, like "risk" and "investment". They then set computers digging into Google’s databases, looking for links between search volumes for each term and changes in the Dow Jones index. And it worked. The computer found correlations between the two. But the researchers went further, showing that the best correlation could be turned into hard cash. Their results showed that a trading strategy of buying when the word "debt" is trending upwards and vice-versa would have generated a profit of more than 300 per cent compared to a simple buy-and-hold strategy. But the key phrase there is "would have". The researchers did not make any money themselves - not because they were above such things but because they would have needed a time machine. That’s because all their results were retrospective, revealing only past correlations. And that’s where the whole idea unravels. By running a list of 100 terms against past records of the Dow Jones, the researchers risked falling into a classic Big Data trap: finding correlations that are meaningless flukes. Such correlations are shockingly common, as former Harvard law student Tyler Vigen has shown through his now-celebrated eponymous website. It contains countless silly but impressively strong correlations found by automatically scouring the web. For example, Vigen’s computers found that the annual amount of honey produced in the US is very strongly correlated to the number of murders using blunt objects. Of course, no one with any common sense would fall for such "links". But that’s the problem with using computers to find them: common sense does not come as standard. In theory, genuine links might exist between search terms like "debt" and stock market changes. But the only way to find out is to check their predictive power. Dr Wai Mun Fong, associate professor of finance at the National University of Singapore, has now done precisely that, in research published in the current Journal of Index Investing. Dr Fong took the same list of about 100 terms used in the original study but this time tested their predictive power in years not examined by the original researchers. Search terms that proved most strongly correlated with the Dow Jones in one year were used to predict market behaviour in the following year. Sure enough, Dr Fong confirmed that some Google search terms were correlated with market moves. But they proved to be "society", "cancer", "home" and various others with pretty tenuous links to investor sentiment. Significantly, one search term that failed to predict the market over this new timescale was "debt". Dr Fong’s conclusions are blunt: using Big Data to predict stock prices that aren’t based on solid economic theory or properly tested "are doomed to be misguided and futile". That such basic warnings are still necessary says much about the spell Big Data is weaving over smart people. Even Google, that titan of Big Data, has proved vulnerable. In 2008 it unveiled Google Flu Trends (GFT), with the aim of helping predict future flu epidemics through spikes in certain search terms. To find these keywords, computers had looked for links between 50 million candidates and just 1,200 flu outbreak data points. So big a mismatch is a sure-fire way of finding spurious correlations. And thus it proved. Like the stock market predictor, GFT made headlines, then mistakes and, ultimately, proved useless. Google threw in the towel in 2015. Now others are going down the same path. The latest victims of Big Data are hedge funds, who have ploughed huge sums into finding patterns that give them an edge. One industry insider recently told Bloomberg that the "insights" they’re finding in Big Data have a failure rate of about 90 per cent. Few can resist surveying the towering masses of global data without believing the prospector’s credo "There’s gold in them thar hills". There is, but it’s buried deep in dross - and simply grabbing a shovel and digging is not the way to find it.

The next version of Android isn’t due for an unveiling until May, but here are all the rumors and alleged features you need to know.  ( Android | Twitter ) Advertisement It's only down to two months until Google officially unveils the next major version of Android following Nougat, which will unsurprisingly hold the moniker "O," following the company's wacky confectionery-themed version releases. While the name is one aspect that's fun to speculate about — many are pointing to popular cookie Oreo, which mirrors the similarly branded Android version KitKat — the features of Android O is where the real story is. New Android O Rumored Features Although the OS itself won't likely be released until fall, it doesn't mean rumors have not started pouring in. They have, and a new one has arrived, even. Here's everything you need to know: • New Notifications System - According to 9to5Google, citing an unnamed source, the next version of Android will feature a revamped notifications system, although what that implies exactly is still ripe for guesswork. While Android Nougat's notification system isn't flawless, it's already pretty good, so the notion of an even better one is perfectly welcome. • Picture-in-Picture Mode - The report also claims that Android O will feature a picture-in-picture TV mode, similar to that of the Android TV. Other smartphones have been able to do such a mode for a long time now, and it's good to see Google finally stepping up to the plate. That is, of course, if the report is accurate. • App Badges - Like how it's done on iOS, Android O will reportedly feature app badges for any active notifications, which sounds simple enough. • Smart Text Selection - There's a vaguely put "smart text selection floating toolbar," which will somehow work in tandem with Google assistant, the report adds. • Other Features - There's also mention of improvements to the MediaRecorder API, restricted background app activity, adaptive icons, and a wellspring of rumors focused on enterprise. Other Rumored Android O Features Other previously rumored features of Android O are Copy Less, which is supposed to be a smarter way of copying chunks of text by determining the context of conversations and contents of an app; Finger gestures, which will lets users draw characters that trigger specific actions, such as drawing a "C" on the screen to access contacts; and the ability to click on links inside text messages that will bring up the appropriate app, such as clicking on an address to trigger Google Maps. What Will Android O Be Called? As previously mentioned, the next version of Android could be called Oreo, but of course, nothing is set in stone. Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's Senior VP of Android, did tease that Android O will indeed be nicknamed Oreo via a tweet. Of course, that doesn't stand as a confirmation, seeing as Lockheimer could have just been jesting. But Oreo is the safest bet as of now. Honestly, what else could it be named after? Oatmeal Cookie? Ovaltine? Android O Release Date Google is expected to unveil Android O's name alongside its features by May 17 during its I/O developer conference. Per usual, that will be followed by a number of beta versions or developer previews before finally entering a wide stable release by fall. Expect due coverage as Android O nears the forefront. Thought of any good names for Android O? What about features? What would you like to see on the next version of Android? Feel free to sound off in the comments section below!

Hence, missing stats, plus some material I stashed after blowing past it in the usual mad rush to post. –lambert Trade “Tisa plans final album” [Solomon Star]. Google hits on TISA not all they could be. But indicative? “Tisa the giraffe dies at Wellington Zoo after general anaesthetic” [New Zealand Herald]. “Malcolm Turnbull is in more trouble than a Stark at a wedding. The polls are down and the knives are out. Part of the problem is he talks a lot but he doesn’t do very much – and there is no better example of that than what he has been doing on trade” [Australian Financial Review]. “One of the biggest trade deals currently being negotiated by 50 countries including the US, European Union and Australia is TiSA – the Trade in Services Agreement. This agreement focuses on services and would cover 70 per cent of the world’s trade in services. Turnbull has said TiSA is a top priority. Last week at Senate estimates we found out just how important the Turnbull government thinks it is. We asked how many people were working on the deal in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The answer – less than one.” “Galvanized by a need to band together against other trade pacts and a desire to preserve the time, effort and intentions that went into the trade agreement, the 12 TPP countries plus China and South Korea are convening in Chile this week” [Sourcing Journal]. “Though the U.S. will be represented at the meeting, the attendee will be the ambassador to Chile rather than the U.S. Trade Representative, who is awaiting confirmation, or another trade official. Rather than forge ahead with separate deals, some members of the group may simply be hoping that if they’re able to keep momentum going on the deal, it will survive long enough to wait out the current political climate in the U.S. Some U.S. government officials may have hopes of their own for this meeting, according to Akira Amari, former Japanese cabinet member. They think that a “TPP minus one” deal could be enough to incite businesses to lobby the U.S. government into reconsidering participation in the pact.” Politics Health Care “Obamacare: Share Your Story” [WhiteHouse.org]. Trump shamelessly steals another Democrat trope (and how come they’re so easy to steal, eh?) New Cold War “The American Empire Isn’t in Decline” [Jacobin]. “We own all your helmets, we own all your shoes / We own all your generals – touch us and you’ll lose….” “Trump Takes on The Blob” [Politico]. “In just a few weeks as president, Trump managed—or threatened—to blow up many of The Blob’s most cherished beliefs about American power. In doing so, he finally united Democrats and many Republicans, hawks and doves, neocons and Obamians, in a frenzy of worry. Whether left or right, fierce advocates of “soft power” or proponents of the “bomb, bomb, bomb” school of international relations, most of the U.S. foreign policy establishment had spent the hours since noon on January 20 in alternating states of fear, rage, dismay, bewilderment and mental exhaustion. The old distinctions no longer seemed to matter as much; for the moment, at least, they were all The Blob now.” Trump Transition “Nothing in the two pages produced on Tuesday night suggested any ties with Russia,” although the tax return is from 2005 [New York Times]. So Maddow is the Northingburger Queen? No line item reading “Dmitri, services rendered: $1,000,000”? On Trump’s EO reorganizing the executive branch: “If there’s anything that Trump hates, it’s having his hands tied and not being in control. He’s only recently come to realize that the President of the United States is not a CEO position but rather a coequal COO position in an organization without a CEO but with a General Counsel (the Supreme Court), a CFO (Congress), and a Board of Directors (Voters). He didn’t sign up for this so he is trying to change the game and the only way he can do this is to remake the executive branch in his own image but first he needs to go to war with it” [John Laprise, Medium]. I agree LaPrise describes one plausible motivation for Trump, but it also tosses the Freedom Caucus a big gummint chew toy. Politics aside, this is a good summary and well worth a read. “Democrats in Congress have long argued that the ongoing intelligence committee investigations into Russia’s interference in the presidential election and the Trump campaign’s ties to the Kremlin are unlikely to get to the bottom of the issue. Now a group of ‘Never Trump’ Republicans are planning to pressure GOP leaders to establish a bipartisan select committee to take over the inquiries and settle the matter once and for all” [WaPo]. And we all know how effective the “Never Trump” crowd was in the primaries… “Trump made clear after the election that he had no appetite to go after Clinton legally, and on Monday his administration went further: His Justice Department went to court to fight those still going after Clinton” [WaPo]. “Two conservative legal groups [Judicial Watch and Cause of Action] were in federal court in Washington on Monday morning to compel the release of more Clinton emails. And the Trump administration was on the other side,” 2016 Post Mortem “Unity commission another challenge for Democrats” [The Hill]. “Progressive calls for open primaries have been met with concerns that new Democratic voters may not share the party’s values.” They say that like it’s a bad thing! From the Senior Editor of the New Republic: 4. There&#39;s also the feeling, on many parts of the left, that Clintonian Dems are using Russian story to evade blame for failed election. &mdash; Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet) March 14, 2017 Ya think? “Kremlin spokesman: Russian ambassador met with advisers to Clinton campaign too” [The Hill]. The audacity! Realignment and Legitimacy “The surge of activism sweeping the U.S. since Donald Trump’s election has energized the nation’s largest socialist organization, which has tripled in size over the last year to claim more than 19,000 dues-paying members. That’s a record for the DSA, which was founded in 1982” [Los Angeles Times]. “The Democratic Socialists of America’s membership spike seems driven by three factors: younger Americans, who polls say are more open to socialism than previous generations; the 2016 Democratic primary campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a self-described democratic socialist whose race ignited a grassroots following but also left bitter feelings about the Democratic Party; and the galvanizing effect that Trump’s election has had on left-leaning Americans, who have increasingly turned to grassroots activism.” Sanders in coal country, McDowell County, West Virginia: Coal miner thanks bernie for advocating for him more than his own senator McConnell. looking forward to how people twist this into misogyny pic.twitter.com/4GLkdRpAIO &mdash; Katie Halper (@kthalps) March 14, 2017 I don’t get it. Why isn’t Sanders calling out this guy for his white privilege and then segueing to his talking points on Putin, like normal Democrat? I look at Sanders as a sort of Johnny Appleseed; see the link to the DSA above. More on Sanders in coal country, via [PoliticsUSA]. “Not only did Sanders debunk the myth that Trump and Republicans constantly feed to their base of supporters that there isn’t enough room in the budget to help those who need it most, but he also convinced one coal miner – a man who voted for Trump – that it’s time to make health care in the United States a universal right.” Video: Same county that voted Trump by 75% erupts when a coal miner says ALL Americans deserve #healthcare, aka #MedicareForAll! #AllInwithBernie pic.twitter.com/PMwBZlu0YU &mdash; RoseAnn DeMoro (@RoseAnnDeMoro) March 14, 2017 And the crowd goes wild. I can’t find the transcript, though. Readers? Blue-State Secession Is Dumb and Cruel” [The Nation]. A nice takedown of Kevin Baker’s ” shrieking” in Salon. To me, what’s important about Baker’s article is that liberals have now abandoned universal benefits as a value; the undeserving shouldn’t have them. Hence, ObamaCare’s lack of universality, the presence of (credentialed) liberal gatekeepers everywhere, etc. Stats Watch Shipping: “[Maritime analytics company Windward says that] cargo ships and other vessels are routinely ‘going dark, making it impossible for authorities to know where they are or what they are doing, risking collisions and loss of life in busy shipping lanes” [Sky News]. “Windward’s data showed that 2,850 ships disappeared off the radar before entering European waters in January and February alone, and while some may have had technical difficulties, most are thought to have been engaged in illegal activity.” Hmm. Given collapsing margins in shipping, such behavior is only to be expected? Retail: “Macy’s is morphing into a discount store” [Business Insider]. “The department-store chain is testing self-service systems in its shoe departments and at its beauty counters, meaning customers would serve themselves instead of finding a salesperson to retrieve shoes or make eyeliner recommendations. This model copies highly successful off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack. Customer service was once what set Macy’s apart from those retailers. Macy’s is realizing that the traditional department store model is crumbling, and it needs to become more like a discount store to stay competitive….” Shrinking their way to profit….. Retail: “Traditionally, Macy’s staffs its shoe sections with a salesperson who runs back and forth between the selling floor and the backroom. But at the locations in this test, customers grab their own size and colors themselves from stacks of shoes, more of which will be on the floor now. In addition to J.C. Penney, which is also testing ‘open sell,’ this way of presenting shoes is similar to practices at off-price chains like TJX Cos’ T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, as well as DSW” [Fortune]. “Open sell” is GENIUS! That said, I have biggish feet that fall between sizes. And I’ve noticed (at the local shoe store I go to) that the size ranges available seem to be decreasing. So I depend on random manufacturing variation, and I need a salesperson to find me the 13 that really a 13-wide. Either that, or I’m going to be sitting on the floor in front of the stak of shoes, trying on shoe after shoe ’til I find the one that fits. More crapification… The Bezzle: “If Google wins its trade secrets suit against Uber, it could tank Uber” [Boing Boing]. Couldn’t happen to a nicer bunch. And when you think about it, a pile of cash like Uber’s got would be expected to attract predators. “But what if Uber loses all its self-driving car research to Google, ordered by a court to go back to square one because it’s been caught stealing trade secrets?… At that point, Uber isn’t just at square one, it’s at square minus one million, having to find an exit for the investors who gave it billions to subsidize our rides in a winner-take-all bet on self-driving cars that the company has lost.” The Bezzle: “How used cars became a security nightmare” [Engadget]. “[IBM’s X-Force Red leader Charles Henderson] quickly realized that everything about security in the world of connected cars revolves around the first owner. They literally haven’t thought through what happens when someone sells it. Henderson tested four major auto manufacturers and found they all use apps that allow previous owners to access the cars from a mobile device. In his talk, he was careful not to tell us who his car’s manufacturer is. And he discovered that only the manufacturer can remove users from its car. The new car owners remain unaware. ‘There’s nothing on the dashboard that tells you ‘the following people have access to the car.'” Holy moley, this is a must-read. This makes the Internet of Shit Things look like nothing. I hesitate even to imagine the software development process that led to such a result… The Bezzle: “Urgent action is needed to curb price gouging by electricity companies who are earning “excessive” profits, sometimes as high as 43 per cent of the total household electricity bill” [Australian Financial Markets]. “While all [Australian] states have deregulated retail electricity prices in the past decade, the report argues that power bills are so complicated and consumers are so bored by them that the free market has not produced the same price competition and innovation as in other markets. The report focuses on Victoria because it was the first state to deregulate in 2009 and provides a clear case where final retail prices to consumers have been rising despite falling electricity generation (wholesale) and distribution (network) costs.” I know at this point I’m cranky and counter-suggestible, but what “other markets” are we talking about, exactly? And what “innovations”? Makes me think that phishing equilibria aren’t accidental to markets, but essential. After all, “free exchange” isn’t the point of a market, is it? Information asymmetry is the point! Our Famously Free Press “Many publishers have scrambled to adopt AMP, Google’s answer to Facebook Instant Articles. As the Guardian’s experience showed, Accelerated Mobile Pages can be a success if publishers put the work in. AMP has gradually been taking over the Guardian’s mobile traffic; today, 60 percent of its Google mobile traffic is AMP, well above the 10 to 15 percent that publishers have been getting from AMP…” [Digiday]. “AMP pages are 2 percent more likely to be clicked on and clickthrough rates on AMP pages to non-AMP pages is 8.6 percent higher than they are on regular mobile pages.” Putting your content into a proprietary data format controlled by a corporate entity far more powerful than you are; what could go wrong? And then there’s this: “Some publishers have complained that they’re not making as much ad revenue on AMP pages as their regular mobile pages; Google says that the revenue results have varied widely depending on factors like how many ad units the publishers run on their AMP pages and what kinds of ad units they sell on their regular mobile pages.” Sounds like a phishing equilibrium to me… Class Warfare “ Wrenching works like this. There is a ruling set with certain nefarious structural interests. The ruling set could be the ruling class (capitalism), white supremacists (racism), cis-male patriarchy (gender oppression), heterosexual norms (sexual oppression), able-bodies (ableism)…and others. Adolph Reed, building on a long tradition of thinking, has pointed out that racism divides the working classes and helps capitalists maintain power. Yet we know this same thing happens in other social categories. Racism divides women in their struggle against patriarchy. It divides queer communities in their struggle against normativity” [Hampton Institute]. “In each case, wrenching has the same form but different contents: in the struggle of a subordinated set against a ruling set within one social category, another social category–adjacent to their struggle–divides the subordinated set. That’s wrenching: when a subordinated set is struggling against a ruling set in one social category and the subordinated set is divided by another social category orthogonal to their struggle.” Interesting concept! “The American middle class keeps shrinking. ‘The share of American adults in middle-income households also decreased, from 55% in 2000 to 51% in 2014,’ Pew Research Center reports. ‘At the same time, the share of adults in the upper-income tier increased from 17% to 20%'” [CNBC]. Not news, really, but I find the next sentence remarkable for CNBC: “ Although income is just one part of class, it’s a crucial element and the one that’s easy to measure and track” (at which point, we discuss the parable of the drunk looking for their keys under the streetlight). “Income is just one part of class” is a statement you don’t hear a lot from neoliberal economists, or even (?) liberal ones. “Welcome to a world of unimaginable wealth and rampant inequality, a world where monolithic corporations act as a law unto themselves, where automation and technological progress threaten to undermine the very foundations of society, and where frightened, forgotten, and furious citizens turn in droves towards political extremism” [Ars Technica]. It’s a tabletop board game, silly! “To emerge victorious in New Angeles, you have to defeat a corporate rival chosen randomly and secretly from among your fellow players. You’ll aim to finish the game with more capital—or victory points—than this rival, meaning that multiple players can win. And while a sharp and savvy executive can find plenty of ways to generate cash, that’s not the game’s only concern. Almost every action you take has an effect on the broader city, sometimes sparking civil unrest and fueling resentment among the populace. Allow dissent to get out of control and the US government will step in to impose—shudder!—market regulation, ending the game in a loss for all players.” Cash isn’t capital… “Google’s parent company, Alphabet, says it plans to apply machine learning technology to promote more civil discourse on the internet and make comment sections on sites a little less awful…. “We have more information and more articles than any other time in history, and yet the toxicity of the conversations that follow those articles are driving people away from the conversation,” said Jared Cohen, president of Jigsaw, formerly known as Google Ideas” [New York Times]. Ah, “the conversation.” Gotcha. And then there’s this, which is the class warfare part: The Times’s comments section is managed by 14 moderators, who manually review nearly every comment. Because this requires considerable labor and time, The Times allows commenting on only about 10 percent of its articles. The Times said in a statement last year that it made its comments archive available to Jigsaw to help develop the machine-learning algorithm running Perspective. Linda Zebian, a spokeswoman for the Times, declined to comment on Wednesday. Some thoughts: Sure, maybe the pencil-necked MBAs at The World’s Greatest Newspaper would rather fire 14 people in favor of an an algo, as opposed to hiring 140 so that humans moderate everything. I mean (guessing) $30K * 140 = $4,200,000 = 14 Thomas Friedmans, so that’s real money. On the other hand, Thomas Friedman’s value approximates zero, and we at NC know the value of a well-curated comments section; imagine scaling that to, well, “the national conversation.” On what you will see is the other hand, there’s a technical question: Some noticed a ginormous increase of Hillbottery in Times comments post-Democrat National Convention. Assuming — and there’s every reason to, given that the Times has, in essence, adopted the business model of Daily Kos — that comment moderation enabled or even skewed those numbers, how do you get an algo to do that? Get a list of pre-approved sample comments from the campaign and feed it to the algo? Or better, pre-approve a list of commenter IPs controlled by the campaign? One hates to be cynical, but 2016 was so clarifying.. “[T]he commanding new fact-on-the-ground is that the American electorate has for now sided with the anti-globalist argument, and we face the imminent presidency of Donald Trump as a result. Should localists declare victory? As we’re about to see, the situation is complicated and holds some opportunities along with plenty of perils” [Common Dreams (DB)]. Let’s be clear: Trump’s ascendancy probably represents not a victory for localism or even populism, but merely a co-optation of legitimate popular frustrations by a corporatist huckster who intends to lead his merry band of cronies and sycophants in looting what’s left of America’s natural and cultural resources. This would be the antithesis of green localism.” Yeah, basically! News of the Wired “What should an anthropology of algorithms do?” (PDF)) [Nick Seaver]. “Why Calvin and Hobbes is Great Literature” [Literary Hub]. “Comics, if we define them at their broadest as sequential art, have been with us from the beginning, on the walls of caves, on the sides of pottery, and in how we translated the many languages of starry night skies into our own, simplifying the chaos of why-are-we-here into creations. And when we remove their words altogether, comics suddenly create a new potential for language: a universal form, a language without language that all may be able to understand, a rejection—and resurrection—of the Tower of Babel.” Interesting article, but I’m dubious about universal forms… “Federal agents can search your phone at the US border — here’s how to protect your personal information” [Business Insider]. “First, Wessler says, travel only with the data that you need. That may mean using burner phones or laptops for traveling. After all, he said, ‘authorities can’t search what you don’t have.’ Second, use encryption services. The Electronic Frontier Foundation and Wired both have exhaustive guides to keeping federal authorities — or hackers, for that matter — from accessing your data. Always choose long, strong, unique passwords for each device and account.” * * * Readers, feel free to contact me with (a) links, and even better (b) sources I should curate regularly, and (c) to find out how to send me images of plants.

Donate $25$50$75$100 00011 This entry was posted in Water Cooler on March 15, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

It turns out that the more you paw through merchandise, the more likely you will discover things you like and want to buy. Its become a treasure hunt! Crapification sells. Reply ↓ marieann March 15, 2017 at 3:08 pm The only really good treasure hunt is found in the thrift stores and yard sales. All the regular stores sell crap, and I’m certainly not going to waste my time looking for non existent treasures. Granted there is also a lot of crap in thrift stores but at least you have the chance of finding some of the better clothing from 20 or so years ago. I also buy up the older appliances, much better made than whats on offer today. Reply ↓ jrs March 15, 2017 at 3:50 pm Much junk in thrift stores, I’ve decided to go without most appliances, they are really mostly unnecessary.. There’s treasures to be found with online shopping for a few things if you look hard enough (why again Amazon tempts people despite it’s evilness). Reply ↓ marieann March 15, 2017 at 5:00 pm Ah! but that’s why you call them treasure hunts….you never know what will be unearthed. And seniors get 30% off on Tuesday :) I dislike online shopping. Reply ↓ Octopii March 15, 2017 at 4:47 pm Yard sale crockpots are always great to find. The new ones run too hot because of food safety regulations. Old ones will truly do LOW and slow. Reply ↓ Carl March 15, 2017 at 6:39 pm Yeah yeah, tell that to a couple of Patagonia baggys shorts I got a few years ago at TJ Maxx for five bucks apiece. They last for practically ever, which is probably why they retail at $50.00. Agree on the older appliances. We have a 1952 Chambers stove, a 40s Hotpoint fridge and a 1955 Coldpoint freezer. Reply ↓ SpringTexan March 16, 2017 at 8:00 am I’m hanging on to my old stove (1983) and my old refrigerator (1993) as long as they work. Yes a new refrigerator would be more energy-efficient, but I understand they hardly last at ALL! If you buy up old appliances, do you have rent houses or something? I would guess that an old appliance still wouldn’t last longer than a new one, since old — but could be wrong.

I’ve listened to all of them. He’s absolutely crushed them all. I think there was maybe 1 time I thought his answer was iffy. One can only imagine how he would have handled a general election sort of debate, depending on the format. Or even if the briefly hyped and hoped-for Trump-Sanders debate during the primaries ever came off. It would have been a sight to see. Sanders (finally getting some help from corp media) continues to break the ridiculous narratives out there about what voters want and think. Reply ↓ neo-realist March 15, 2017 at 3:35 pm The corporate media/power structure doesn’t mind featuring your narratives or putting you on a pedestal when you are not in a position of power to enact policies based on those narratives (those that challenge TPTB.) It’s akin to cities naming streets and buildings after dead civil rights leaders and Presidents who challenged the power structure (Kennedy.) Reply ↓ Bardamu March 15, 2017 at 3:41 pm “During the lifetime of great revolutionaries, the oppressing classes constantly hounded them, received their theories with the most savage malice, the most furious hatred and the most unscrupulous campaigns of lies and slander. After their death, attempts are made to convert them into harmless icons, to canonize them, so to say, and to hallow their names to a certain extent for the “consolation” of the oppressed classes and with the object of duping the latter, while at the same time robbing the revolutionary theory of its substance, blunting its revolutionary edge and vulgarizing it.” VI Lenin I am the Walrus.

There really aren’t “millions” of Hillbots in the field. Most of the people who voted for her disliked her and only dragged themselves to the polls out of fear of Trump, or entrenched tribal loyalty. No way would the Clintonistas have been able to make all those people even more afraid of Bernie than Trump.

Reply ↓ David March 15, 2017 at 3:57 pm Well, since you ask, ruling powers since time immemorial have practiced divide and rule, by playing identity groups off against each other, often inventing (or at least solidifying) groups for the purpose. Thus, for example “tribalism” in Africa, which was essentially a political question, became an ethnic question because colonial powers believed in genetic differences between peoples and acted as if that were true. The legacy lives on today. But that’s only part of the game. The next trick is to identify a particular group for favourite treatment. This could be a marginalized group (like the Acholi in Uganda) from which the police and military would be drawn, or an elite group, like the Muslim tribes from the area north of Khartoum who still provide the Sudanese elites today. Such groups were Europeanized, taught colonial languages, and their leaders sent for education and training abroad. Both groups tended to identify with the colonial power more than their fellow Africans. On independence, you therefore had political elites speaking English, French or Portuguese, all ready to take over. But of course you could do the same thing at home. The British aristocracy was able to hold on to power as long as it did by a carefully judged process of peeling off layers of the rising middle classes and giving them honors, status, and finally admission to the aristocracy itself. The French Crown couldn’t pull the same trick, because the political structure of the country was entirely different, and there was a quite well-known violent conclusion in 1789. Nothing much changes. As long as you can convince people who are being objectively exploited that they are actually exploiting each other, and cream off a few to provide the illusion of success, then you can stay in power forever. If you can convince a woman stocking shelves at a supermarket that her husband, doing the same job for the same pay, is the real oppressor, then you’ve got a population capable of disciplining itself.

I don’t want to come off as that guy, “You said this you’re wrong nyah nyah nyah.” But I think for 1789, you might be selling the French short in their mechanisms of social mobility. There were many routes to nobility for the rich third estaters before the revolution. Where the thing fell apart, many historians think, among other reasons, was the inefficiency of the farmed tax system, and in the suspicion of central banks after John Law in 1720, both of which crippled the finances of the state. Not to mention the amount of capital dedicated to the Church’s regular orders, which had never been dissolved, as they had been in Protestant lands. Anyway, if Louis had had a central bank, he’d be alive today. LOL. Reply ↓ David March 16, 2017 at 5:13 am Yes, I was a bit too glib with my reference to 1789. You’re basically right. My point (basing myself on Ertman’s “Building Leviathan” ) was that the British system, with its alternative centres of power and parliamentary control over expenditure, was much more flexible, and produced a ruling class with its own ability to transform and adapt, without depending on royal favour all the time. I think the tax-farming system, which was probably all that was feasible in an absolutist-patrimonial state, certainly had a lot to do with the decline of the monarchy – it made financing wars very difficult, for example.

IIRC, it was possible for the French bourgeoisie to purchase a title (and there were tax advantages to doing to, aside from the cachet).

Reply ↓ David March 16, 2017 at 7:42 am In pre-Revolutionary France just about everything was for sale, including state offices, and of course titles, because of the desperate need to raise money. The British, on the other hand, recognised that there were things that people would do for social status that they would never do for money, and acted accordingly. Interestingly, the technique hasn’t entirely died out. In the 1980s, during the worst years of the Thatcher Recession, there was often a mutinous mood among Tory MPs. Whenever this happened, the whips would do the rounds, muttering about how the next round of Knighthoods for politicians was even then being worked on. It never failed to shut the dissidents up.

Or so most scientists thought. They had vigorously fought bill language drafted by Representative Lamar Smith (R–TX), chair of the House of Representatives science committee, that would have altered NSF’s well-regarded system of peer review and its commitment to a balanced research portfolio. And Smith had generally acceded to his Senate counterparts in negotiating the final version of the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA), enacted on 6 January. But last week Smith made clear at a hearing of the science committee that he’s gearing up for a new fight. And his comments suggest he’s intent on covering much of the same ground, starting with his view that NSF’s charge to support research “in the national interest” means it should fund less social science and environmental research. … Smith made clear in his opening statement that everything NSF does is back on the table. … Strangely, it’s only Democrats who proclaim that something is off the table.

The plan, which faces a vote before the House Budget Committee on Thursday, would slash revenue for the fund that pays for hospital benefits — a precedent-setting move if signed into law. It’s not the first time that fund has been threatened, but if the ObamaCare repeal plan is implemented, it would be the first time Congress took an action pushing it near the funding cliff. The cuts would bring the trust fund several years closer to running out of money, worrying Medicare advocates and budget hawks — and potentially leading to hospital reimbursement cuts. … The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Congressional Budget Office estimate the repeal would speed up the trust fund’s insolvency date from 2026 and 2028 under current law, to 2024 or 2025. … Fake news.

Mobile-Controlled Everything The last big innovation in cruising dealt with RFID-enabled wristbands that let you scan in and out of the ship at port or charge drinks to your room. But wearables are a thing of the past, said Lutoff-Perlo. On the Edge ships, you’ll be able to do everything on your phone, from checking in to unlocking your stateroom door or controlling your room’s temperature and lighting. It all happens via a proprietary Celebrity app, which also puts the concierge, ship map, and daily event schedule in each guest’s pocket. “We’ll send you notifications for the things you’ve told us you’re interested in and use it to reduce pain points across the entire experience,” said Lutoff-Perlo. “It will help us personalize your cruise as we’ve never been able to do before.” http://gcaptain.com/royal-caribbean-jettisons-balconies-adopts-rfid-tracking-new-celebrity-edge-class-design/?utm_campaign=twitter&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitter Reply ↓ Hana M March 15, 2017 at 5:41 pm Don’t miss the promotional Royal Caribbean cruise video.

Reply ↓ Massinissa March 15, 2017 at 5:55 pm From a quote in the Jacobin article, apparently Obama right out admitted that he made promises during his first election campaign he didn’t intend to keep. “Politicians, Obama stressed, often make promises that they don’t keep. “My simple point is that you can’t assume that the language of campaigning matches up with the specifics of governing, legislation, regulations, and foreign policy,” Obama said. He continued: “I can’t guarantee that the president-elect won’t pursue some of the positions that he’s taken. But what I can guarantee is, is that reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues. That’s just the way this office works.”” And he presents this as though its perfectly ok and natural. If politicians can make promises they don’t intend to keep, then how the hell is the populace supposed to know what theyre in store for when they elect someone? Reply ↓ JustAnObserver March 15, 2017 at 6:17 pm This is such classic Obama. Using rhetorical skills to elide/obscure the huge difference between 1. Don’t intend (never intended) to keep. and 2.

Obama had risen to that level of duplicity, not a lie in the conventional sense of saying something that wasn’t true, but an entirely constructed false persona. He had polished the tools of the Presidency – the utter banality of PR, the constipated talking points, the routine abuse of power – and taken them to a new level with a self-aware sense of irony about his own narcissistic dishonesty. His challenge was so outrageous – I dare you to call me on what a liar I am as I joke about how much I am lying to you right now – that he turned an obnoxious bluff into art. Personally I blame it all on David Letterman, that pioneer of the everything is bullshit school of humor. By the time Obama came along the Age of Irony was in full swing with the Coen brothers as the era’s cinema poet laureates. Indeed we are so steeped in this particular zeitgeist that it’s no wonder that the very uncool Trump has provoked a reaction close to hysteria.

Any Harvard alums in the assembled throng? Because I think the alumi office might need to have this drawn to their attention: Reply ↓ Merasmus March 17, 2017 at 1:29 am I wouldn’t say that Saker is fake news, because he mostly isn’t, but at this point I see no reason for anyone to read him. I first discovered him, and read his stuff daily, during the events in Ukraine in 2014. But that died down after several months, and he increasingly started writing about things other than battlefield updates and strategic analysis. Eventually I got to the point where I couldn’t tolerate his bigotry any more. The man is frankly a hate-filled asshole, and at times it bleeds into even his geopolitical writings. I got really tired of the ‘history’ lessons on the West’s centuries long hatred of Russia and Europeans inherent desire to eradicate Slavs (did you know that Napoleon was a Mason, and was commanded by the Satanic priests to destroy Russia? Such is the wisdom of The Saker), the frequent ranting about the ‘AngloZionists’ who are apparently behind virtually everything bad in the world (related to that is his belief that there is no such thing as a unique Jewish ethnicity or culture; he’s embraced the debunked Khazar hypothesis, beloved by antisemites the world over), and then the final straw was when I read his multiple, downright disgusting articles about homosexuals (whom he refuses to call ‘gay’, he calls them ‘sads’). Looking back to his writings before 2014 you can find this gem of stupidity: http://vineyardsaker.blogspot.com/2012/07/will-pedophilia-be-next-paraphilia-to.html “So let’s sum it up.  “Gay rights” are neither about gaiety, nor about rights.  This is the organized political expression of a group of psychologically sick people who are seeking to impose their sexual dysfunctions and pathology as a norm on the rest of society and which do so with the utmost regression and intolerance.  History shows than these groups only prevailed in degenerating societies and that when they did achieve their objectives, the society which they submitted to their agenda rapidly collapsed.” Not only does he have that common conservative obliviousness to the concept of informed consent, but he has a bizarre illiteracy in regards to history, something he frequently writes about. And of course all the while he’s spewing his bile he’s insisting he has no beef with homos, I mean he thinks they’re a bunch of depressed, broken, sinful sexual freaks who don’t deserve equal protection under the law, but he doesn’t really have a problem with them, just so long as they shut up, stay in the closet about their freakish deviance, and don’t offend him with their existence. Incidentally, would you like to hear about Eastern Orthodox Jesus and his boundless love, and how he’s the bedrock of a proper civilization? Did you know that Tsar Nicholas II is a Saint and a glorious defender of Slavs? What’s that, he wasn’t willing to fight for Bosnia, and was a repressive monster who loathed his people and had thousands of them executed by his secret murder police? No! says The Saker, he was a Saint because the Orthodox Church says was a Saint. Not unrelated, after reading enough Saker I started to get the distinct impression that the only reason he claims to hate fascists is because they once invaded Russia. Had the Germans never invaded, or had the invaders not been fascists, I seriously wonder if he would profess such a hatred of them. If fascism came wrapped in a Russian tricolor and carrying a Greek Orthodox Bible I suspect he would welcome it. He certainly seems to share a lot of their ideas. These days he’s a contributor to The Unz Review, which among many other things hosts white supremacist writings that really can’t be called anything other than Nazi. Fitting company. Reply ↓ Geof March 16, 2017 at 3:08 pm Some noticed a ginormous increase of Hillbottery in Times comments post-Democrat National Convention. Assuming — and there’s every reason to, given that the Times has, in essence, adopted the business model of Daily Kos — that comment moderation enabled or even skewed those numbers I conducted an scholarly study of Times comments on the story revealing Snowden as the NSA leaker. My evidence suggests that comment editors deliberately shaped discussion through their selection of “staff picks” (which heavily influenced comment ratings and visibility). Of the 50 comments with the highest ratings (most likes), 30 supported Snowden, while 12 were critical of him. But of staff picks among the top 50, the split was almost even: 11 to 9 (thus of non-staff picks, the split was a lopsided 19 to 3). A random sample of 50 comments found an even split, 15 to 14. My analysis suggests that staff picks are chosen from top-rated comments (which then posts those comments’ ratings more); they are not reflective of overall sentiment. If these numbers are significant (they might not be; they are small), it seems that editors were attempting to balance opposing views. This wouldn’t be surprising: balance between two opposing sides is a core tenet of journalistic objectivity, for better and for worse (as climate change “debate” demonstrated). I suspect that this was the motivation. On the one hand, this would mean that top comments did not reflect reader views. On the other, discussion can benefit from disagreement, as it encourages more vigorous discussion. (On the Guardian, where virtually everyone supported Snowden, comments were short and lacked substance. What they demonstrated instead was solidarity.) Alternatively, it is possible that the picks reflected editor bias. I doubt that they did so consciously, but given that they were already engaged in shaping discussion it is possible that bias crept in. Regardless, the comments were an important corrective to a terrible article. The text of the article was all about political gamesmanship (he embarrassed Booz Allen Hamilton!): it basically ignored the substantive democratic questions the leaks raised (though I presume those were dealt with in other articles). Commenters, in contrast, couldn’t care less about the game: they cared about spying on Americans what it meant for American democracy. I found a similar pattern in my study of the article about Aaron Swartz’s death. Top-rated comments focused on the injustice (or not) of the government prosecution and debated Swartz’s cause (freedom of knowledge; Times commenters were more critical of Swartz than were those on other sites I looked at). The article itself, however, avoided criticism of government by presenting Swartz as a Troubled Genius – a one-off tragedy, not an instance of a system gone wrong. For both Snowden and Swartz, the comments were an important corrective.

The U.S. company said in a blog post Friday it would give clients more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites. The announcement came after the U.K. government and the Guardian newspaper pulled ads from the video site, stepping up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform.

Ads appeared “next to extremist and hate-filled videos,” prompting Guardian News & Media to stop all advertising through YouTube parent Google, the British publisher said in an emailed statement Friday. The U.K. government said it suspended advertising on YouTube until the site can ensure they’re not placed next to content it doesn’t approve of. “Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content,” the U.K. government said in an emailed statement. “We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way.” Britain, Germany Britain’s government said it summoned Google for discussions to explain how it can guarantee the state’s demands are met, while on Tuesday Germany threatened to fine social networks such as Facebook as much as 50 million euros ($53 million) if they fail to give users the option to complain about hate speech and fake news or refuse to remove illegal content. British supermarket chain J Sainsbury Plc., whose ads appeared on videos posted by the white nationalist Polish Defence League, said it and its sister brand Argos would immediately suspend all Google advertising. “It is unacceptable that Google is allowing our ads to be placed alongside these videos on YouTube,” the company said in an emailed statement. It said it was seeking “urgent assurances” from Google that the problems were being addressed. The Guardian said it would be withdrawing its advertising until Google could provide guarantees that the ad misplacement wouldn’t happen in future. “It is completely unacceptable that Google allows advertising for brands like the Guardian to appear next to extremist and hate-filled videos,” Guardian News & Media said. L’Oreal, the cosmetics brand, said it was unaware that ads it was running in connection with the Prince’s Trust, a charity founded by Prince Charles that helps train disadvantaged young people for work, were appearing on YouTube channels associated with extremists. "We are horrified that our campaign -- which is the total antithesis of this extreme, negative content -- could be seen in connection with them," the company said in a statement. L’Oreal said it planned to work more closely with Google to make sure it didn’t happen again. (Updates with comments from Havas parent company in sixth paragraph.

Over the last two days, there has been talk on how the initiative has finally reached Zimbabwe. In light of this, I thought it important for me to just give you simple reasons (that you might have just overlooked) on why you should actually participate. 1. It’s free Well, I know that might sound silly but free doesn’t really mean much to Zimbos when it comes to tech related workshops (my observation at least and please feel free to prove me wrong). Unless of course there is free food and/or refreshments. Nonetheless, I personally feel like free things should really be taken advantage of. I guarantee you that the next time you want to learn this very content Google is offering, it will not be for free! Or maybe you-yourself will teach the content you acquired for free someday at a cost – it’s called business. 2. No qualification prerequisite Maybe some of you are familiar with the hassle of applying for a vacancy and the struggle of trying to make your qualifications sound like a cut above the rest. If you know what I’m talking about, then you know exactly why I put this as a reason to attend. Google, (as we know it) is offering digital skill courses and you do not need any qualifications to partake! Therefore, there is no restriction, any ambitious entrepreneur can benefit from this, regardless of educational background (which is not always a fitting criteria to use for most of us, but story for another day!). advertisement 3. Lessons applicable to any line of business The general perception is that only tech related businesses should participate, but that’s entirely misleading. Google acknowledges that the world is fast digitising, therefore, to remain relevant in any field, there is need for businesses and individuals to learn these skills and keep up. Luke Mckend, the Google SA country director testifies on how local businesses have been helped since the offered tools and technologies are basic enablers that can be applied to literally any line of business. In fact, this is an opportunity for individuals to leverage the internet in order to give their businesses an online presence which is much more robust than the traditional way of doing business. 4. Person to person training In as much as the content being learnt is being made available online (for now that is) g.co/digitalskills ,if there is a chance to actually meet face to face with the teacher, why not? Maybe I am still backward for being biased towards learning in the old fashioned classroom way, but I would take that over online any day only if it’s an available alternative. However, this point is mostly relevant to those who actually need the digital skills first to then know how to access online material. So this might not be relevant to you directly, but I’m pretty sure you know someone who suits this criteria perfectly and would really appreciate you telling him/her about it.   5. Certificate of attendance Who doesn’t want those? Considering how much of a tech giant Google is, a mere certificate of attendance will go a long way in authenticating your career/ cause.   Image credit: digitalskills.withgoogle.com share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Digital Skills Training, Google Previous Post « Introducing Deals Friday Next post Friday Deal: Bluetooth remote controlled selfie stick by Amplify » 16 Comments Anonymous says: March 17, 2017 at 6:46 AM Hi Where can we register and were is the training?The link in your last article was broken.Acomment on this was made but its still broken.

Comment By Tony Parsons 19th March 2017, 2:19 am Updated: 19th March 2017, 3:31 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments MPs have queued up to shame Facebook, Twitter and Google for the child abuse, racist bile and terrorist propaganda that they routinely allow to thrive on their morally bankrupt sites. What will change? Nothing. PA:Press Association 6 Social media chiefs were quizzed by MPs over whether they were doing enough to monitor what gets uploaded on their sites The filth-peddling web giants will continue to permit the worst people in the world to splash happily in their digital sewers. There will still be sickening celebrations of child abuse on Facebook. There will still be racist bile over every inch of Twitter. And hate preachers will still be given a global soapbox on Google, who confessed to the MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee that they had actually raked in advertising money from Islamic hate preachers on YouTube. Stop and think about it for a moment. Google did not merely show the ravings of hate preacher Anjem Choudary, they featured adverts for video game Call of Duty at the same time. We don’t want illegal content on our platforms and when flagged to us we remove that as quickly as we can. Peter Barron Has the world gone insane? This is not the bright and shining future that the internet promised us. This is a vision of hell. These are the new dark ages, where the very worst impulses of humanity are allowed to scream from the safety of Facebook, Twitter and Google. The MPs seemed genuinely furious at the daily outrages of the web giants but the lavishly paid, loftily indifferent executives had their feeble excuses well rehearsed. PA:Press Association 6 Google’s Peter Barron said that when illegal content is flagged it’s removed as soon as possible Asked by Labour’s Yvette Cooper if Google did any proactive work to remove “clearly illegal content including terrorism and online child abuse,” their public affairs chief Peter Barron replied simply “No.” Google’s defence, and it is the same pitiful get-out clause all these trash-peddlers deploy, is that there is simply far too much content to police. “We have 400 hours of video a minute uploaded to YouTube,” whined the man from Google. “We don’t want illegal content on our platforms and when flagged to us we remove that as quickly as we can.” Unbelievable. Why should it be the responsibility of the public to report racist filth or child rape when it appears on Facebook, Twitter and Google? MOST READ IN OPINION Damian Thompson Prince William's 'arrogant antics' are an insult to the Queen and her legacy after those cringey videos JEREMY CLARKSON It's time to ban balloons... we're told they're as dangerous as an AK47 and heroin AND they kill horses KELVIN MACKENZIE If you think legalising drugs is a good idea, look at this zombie high on Spice and think of the children KARREN BRADY Prince William barely puts a foot wrong... apart from his dad dancing and the criticism seems unfair Trevor Kavanagh Snap election would let the PM ride the crest of a wave of popularity to transform political landscape The Sun says It is sad to see former Prime Ministers resort to slinging insults at the voters Ally Ross Lionel Blair’s a cabaret of sunshine in the BBC’s 5-star hotel and it's a lesson on who to book for reality shows Lorraine Kelly Party boy Prince William is 'going downhill' as he tries to relive his youth... is it a mid-life crisis?

And it is simply not the case that offensive material is swiftly deleted the second the public complains. Tweets using the phrase “filthy Jew bitch” were not considered sufficiently extreme to be removed by Twitter while a film posted by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke entitled “Jews admit causing white genocide” was not removed by Google, who conceded that it was anti-Semitic but maintained it “didn’t cross the line into hate speech.” So that’s all right then, is it? No, it is not. We should never allow the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Google to contaminate our world. There can’t be one law for newspapers and no law at all for Facebook, Google and Twitter. PA:Press Association 6 Yvette Cooper challenged Google on how proactive they were being in attempting to remove inappropriate content from their sites The toxic oceans of corrosive material that are being pumped into the mainstream of our lives, and the lives of our children, are doing immense damage to our society. The web giants are legitimising hatred. All the evil impulses that were once in the shadows — child rape, the most virulent forms of racism, terrorist propaganda — are now strutting and preening in the flattering light provided by Facebook, Twitter and Google. For all the scorn they received from MPs, the new pornographers of these new dark ages clearly have no inclination or incentive to police themselves. So someone is going to have to do it for them.  Google - Year In Search 2016 - See what the world searched for in 2016 We must urgently follow Germany’s lead, where it has been suggested that Twitter, Facebook and Google could be fined up to £40million if they continue to promote hatred. Why stop at £40million? They need to understand that social responsibility doesn’t end just because the media platform is online. The immoral web giants have to be held to exactly the same standards of decency as your daily newspaper. “There are 500 million tweets every day,” squeaked Nick Pickles, head of public policy at Twitter. “If you want pre-moderation of internet platforms then there may well be no internet platforms.” Fine. The man from Twitter doesn’t understand that millions of us are no longer prepared to meekly tolerate a total lack of human decency online where — to give one example — the beheading of an aid worker by ISIS is shown on Twitter as if it is family entertainment. Enough. It is time to bring the unethical web giants to heel. Twitter, Facebook and Google have got away with murder for far too long. Slash the foreign aid spend PA:Press Association 6 George Osborne will take over as the Evening Standard's editor in May NO doubt George Osborne, the surprising new editor of the London Evening Standard, will come up with many Brexit-bashing headlines that will make my blood boil. But credit where it is due – Osborne, above, could have his nose buried as deep as Tony Blair in the lucrative lecture circuit trough. His bold career move reflects well on him – and on the vibrant, endlessly diverse British newspaper industry. Let’s just hope he’s a better editor than he was a Chancellor. And speaking of the men holding the nation’s purse strings, if the Tories are the party of business, then why is the Chancellor of the Exchequer always so miserably woeful at handling our money? The bleak years of Osborne, with his ridiculous pasty tax and Project Fear, have been followed by old undertaker chops, Philip Hammond. He was humiliated into ripping up his ill-conceived budget just seven days after so smugly delivering it. One day there will be a Chancellor who is not so spectacularly out of touch with the real world. And the first thing he or she will do is to rip up our insane commitment to foreign aid. If the Chancellor wants to fill the Treasury’s coffers, the billions wasted on foreign aid is exactly the place to start. EXTINCT EXPRESSIONS RESEARCH shows words like “whatshername?”, once heard all the time, have slipped from common usage. I recall it was used all the time by, oh, whatshername? Oh, yes – my mother. My mum was also fond of now defunct expressions like, “got the hump” (very unhappy) “lose my rag” (misplace one’s temper) and “get my goat” (to find rather irritating). If my lovely old mum were alive today, nobody would understand a word she said. Hounding of the heroes must stop PA:Press Association 6 Royal Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman has had his conviction reduced JAILED Royal Marine Alexander Blackman has had his murder conviction for killing a wounded Taliban fighter reduced to manslaughter after judges decided he was suffering from combat stress. Heartless top Army brass abandoned him. Gutless politicians wiped their hands of him. But Sergeant Blackman bravely served his country in a dirty war that was started by men who never heard a shot fired in anger. And I hope he knows that to millions of his fellow countrymen, he will always be a hero. As disgraced tank-chaser lawyer Phil Shiner declares himself bankrupt, let Sergeant Blackman be the last British serviceman who is ever hounded through British courts. Fashion for fur 6 Naomi Campbell took part in the anti-fur campaign in 1994 IN 1994, some of the most famous models in the world – including Naomi Campbell – posed naked, to promote an anti-fur campaign – “We’d rather go naked than wear fur.” Back then wearing fur was seen as old-fashioned and cruel. How long ago it seemed last week when smiling women proudly posed in their real fur hats at the Cheltenham Festival. “Fur is something that is really on-trend,” boasted one. I bet fur wouldn’t be so on-trend if these pea-brained bimbos watched the animals that had to be skinned – while still alive, don’t forget – to make every last one of their hideous accessories. — PETS AT HOME is introducing a new policy for its 8,200 staff – a day’s paid paternity leave when they get a new pet. As I recall, a new puppy is much harder work than a baby. A baby does its business in their nappy. But a puppy does it anywhere. After that day off, the Pets at Home staff will be happy to go back to work. Scottish life expectancy at its lowest LIFE expectancy in Scotland is the lowest in the UK and it is not the fault of the wicked English. This has happened after ten years of the SNP. This has happened on Nicola Sturgeon’s watch. No wonder she wants the distraction of a second referendum. Theresa May is right to defend the United Kingdom with the words: “We are four nations but at heart we are one people.” And millions of us are made from more than just one of those nations.I am an Englishman with Irish blood on my mother’s side of the family and Scottish blood on my father’s side. There are millions of proud British mongrels like me. It is centuries of the mixing of those four nations that binds us together. In a real sense, we are family.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google Assistant Might Soon Get A Screen Search Button That Performs Manual Searches By Zara Ali Mar 15, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Google has rolled out its AI Assistant to almost all the devices running Nougat and Marshmallow smartphones in the US. Now, with Google Assistant’s increased presence on Android devices, the tech giant is planning to make it even smarter by adding screen search feature. Related Google Confirms That It Won’t Bring Google Assistant To Android Tablets Many users took to Reddit for sharing the screenshots of Screen Share feature on Google Assistant. A new What’s on my screen” button is placed next to the “Share screenshot” option. It also means that now the old method to swipe up screen for search won’t work and “Send feedback” button has also disappeared from the screen. For now, Google is testing the new feature with select users, which means that not all the users could see them on their app. Advertisement A Reddit user shared the information on the new feature, he said: “Triggering GA now seems to immediately present me with the options of either searching the screen or sharing the screenshot. The swipe up for screen search functionality no longer works for me. I definitely prefer this to the old method although it is still one tap more than Now on Tap used to need. A little disappointed that OCR text selection has still not made its triumphant return, but one can hope!.” While the new function does not make a significant impact on the overall productivity of the app, but it’s nice to see Google stepping out of the box to introduce new tools. The change is pretty useful when it comes to access screenshots option and use it as now they won’t need to scroll through a list. Notably, for the users of Now on Tap, Screen search is not as fast as swipe up the option, and it also lacks in loading search results. Google has not confirmed the inclusion of the new button yet, which could mean there are chances if Google at all introduces the new features on a wider scale. The company first tests the feature on select devices and then decides whether to roll it out to all the devices. Related Latest Google Play Music Update Adds Wi-Fi Streaming And Playback Quality Options If you are one of those who does not like Google Assistant and would rather have Now on Tap back, then you can read this article to switch back. The process is pretty simple, and in few steps, you will get rid of Google Assistant.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google Has a Very Irresponsible Attitude When It Comes to Restocking Its Pixel Lineup By Omar Sohail Mar 15, 2017 14Shares Share Tweet Submit Despite having the world’s largest search engine coupled with having a dominating market share of its mobile operating system, Google cannot seem to keep its Pixel and Pixel XL in stock, irrespective of which model you intend to purchase right now. Both Pixel and Pixel XL Are Extremely Scarce – Nothing Like This Ever Happened With the Nexus Lineup Visit the official Google Store right away and if you want to place your order for either the Pixel or Pixel XL, you will see an ‘Out of Stock’ label present right beneath the price of the phone. If you are living in the US, and want to purchase the flagship from the company’s store then you will be fresh out of luck so it is better that you look through an alternate channel in making your purchase. Verizon is one of those alternatives, and while the carrier has managed to solve the stock issues plaguing the Pixel and Pixel XL, it still leaves us with one complicated issue. Related Codenames For Upcoming Google Pixel 2 Phones Reportedly Revealed Not everyone is using the carrier Verizon as their daily driver and if they want to be the proud owner of Google’s flagship smartphone, they will have to change their number to do so. While this is not a complicated procedure, updating your contacts list and letting them know about the new number is an arduous process. Advertisement At first, the exclusivity of Google Assistant running in both devices might have been a compelling selling point, but with the feature being available to different devices, the only thing that Pixel can offer is getting software and security updates much faster than the competition. Its hardware is top-notch too but being categorized under the flagship label, we expect both phones to perform well. However, we understand the level of frustration stemming from the lack of Pixel units available for the public, especially when users do not want to switch their numbers over and over again. Related Pixel Owners Are Experiencing Mic Troubles With No Fix in Sight Let us hope that Google is able to make things right with it officially announces its Pixel 2 otherwise it could leave a bad impression on the consumer. Do you think Google’s behavior in restocking the Pixel is very casual? Let us know your thoughts down in the comments.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement LG G6 comes with a free Google Home (if you order by April 30th) 03/16/2017 at 12:15 PM by Brad Linder 2 Comments The LG G6 goes on sale in the US starting April 7th. Two US wireless carriers have announced plans to sell LG’s new flagship phone, with the price coming to $650 over the course of a 2-year T-Mobile contract or $720 on a 2-year contract from AT&T. But wherever you buy the LG G6, US customers can also get a freebie: LG is throwing in a free Google Home if you place an order by April 30th. Is that a good deal? Maybe… if you were already planning on buying a new phone and a Google Home. Google normally sells its smart speaker for $129, so this is sort of like getting a $129 discount… assuming you want a smart home speaker with baked-in support for the Google Assistant voice service. If you don’t, then you’d probably rather just spend $129 less for the G6. That’s not an option yet, but if the phone is anything like more flagships, it’ll probably go on sale from time to time a few months after launch. The G6 is LG’s first phone with an ultra-wide display featuring a 2:1 aspect ratio (which LG calls 18:9). It also has slim bezels, IP68 water and dust resistance, dual 13MP cameras and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Mobile Platform chip. LG’s phone measures about 149mm x 72mm x 8.3mm and has a 2,880 x 1,440 pixel display with a diagonal measurement of 5.7 inches. The key benefit to the wide aspect ratio is that it lets you multitask by running two apps in side-by-side windows of identical size. Google Home, meanwhile, is basically Google’s answer to the Amazon Echo. It’s a small internet-connected speaker that’s always listening for voice commands or questions. Since it’s tied to your Google account, it can do a few things Echo cannot, like send videos to a Chromecast-enabled TV. But Amazon has a bit of a head start in this space, so Google is still playing catch up in third-party app and service support. Update: Sprint, Verizon, and US Cellular have all announced pricing for the LG G6 as well.

Google has been ordered by the Government to explain why taxpayer-funded adverts are appearing alongside extremist material The technology giant has been accused of "profiting from hatred" by MPs over its YouTube advertising system that saw taxpayer-funded adverts appear alongside extremist content on the video site. The Home Affairs Select Committee has now written to Google asking for an explanation. The Cabinet Office said it has placed a temporary restriction on its YouTube advertising "pending reassurances from Google that Government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way", while The Guardian, Channel 4 and the BBC have also halted their advertising with the firm. Google's advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts on websites and videos. In a letter to Google's communications vice president Peter Barron, committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: "Government advertisements and major brands advertising is still being placed on inappropriate and hate-filled sites. "As a result Google and these organisations are still profiting from hatred. "In addition to explaining to the Government and to your advertisers how this has happened and what you are doing to prevent it ever happening again, please can you provide the Committee with a full explanation of this, including whether you will be refunding money to the Government and other advertisers." The internet giant's UK managing director Ronan Harris had earlier admitted the company "can and must do more" to combat what it called "bad advertising". "We've begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network. "With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don't always get it right. "In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetization policies," he said. "We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more." However, Ms Cooper said the company's "lack of effort and social responsibility" towards the content was "extremely troubling". "It is inexplicable to us that Google can move very fast to remove material from YouTube when it is found to be copyrighted, but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves proscribed organisations and hateful and illegal content," she said. "The Committee expects to hear from you on how you are using some of YouTube's very significant revenue to put this problem right by devoting sufficient resources to ensure that vile and illegal material is removed proactively from your platforms, and that neither you nor those that create these videos profit from hatred." Media advertising firm GroupM has suggested "a 100% foolproof system" to prevent further incidents may not be possible. The firm, which is part of advertising giant WPP, also warned that Google and YouTube's tools to stop bad advert placement were "not infallible" in a letter to clients. GroupM's chief digital officer Rob Norman said the technology giant should apologise over the incident. "We believe Google owes two apologies, one to advertisers for compromising their brand reputations and the other to consumers for the presence of the content," he said. "Google should also make clear that the flaw is in Google's controls, so no consumer may think that a brand, through its adjacency, is an endorser of the content."

The feature, available via the apps and mobile browser, will let users enter the destination and click the ‘get direction’ icon. Users can then select the ‘transit’ icon to view time, bus numbers, bus stops, Ola and Uber cabs available, routes and other travel information like where to stop for the next bus. Users in these cities could previously only check the route for travelling via car or walking. The new update adds public and private transport options. Note that Google had added public transport schedules for the other 9 cities back in 2012 and 2015, and integrated private transportation apps like Uber and Ola in March last year. Note that users need to have the taxi apps installed for the integration to work. The integrations would display an estimated pick up time, time to destination and fare. Google has been steadily integrating new features on its Maps app, like updating it to work for offline use. In 2015, the company had added traffic information for 12 more cities, after having introduced traffic alerts the same year. The company is also looking to monetize its product. In May last year, it started experimenting with new ad formats on Google Maps, showing logos for business locations on the web and the mobile app. Users could tap the logo, and the business page could display coupons for items at the store or let users browse its inventory.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Accessories Image Source: Google Google removes audio ads from Google Home hours after introducing them Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal March 17th, 2017 at 5:44 PM Share Tweet Google Home owners were surprised to find themselves bombarded with audio ads for Disney’s upcoming live-action Beauty and the Beast remake this week. On Thursday morning, Reddit user CaptainCaptioni says he was getting ready for work and said “OK Google, good morning” to his Google Home, like he always does. After Google Assistant gave him the time and weather forecast, it started talking about the Disney movie. Don't Miss: The Galaxy S8 will do at least one cool thing your iPhone can’t Several other Redditors chimed in, saying they had heard it too: “By the way, Disney’s live action Beauty and the Beast opens today,” Google Assistant said. “In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer if you ask me. For some more movie fun, ask me something about Belle.” While an ad like this might not be so egregious if someone initiated a conversation about the movie, multiple Google Home owners on Reddit noted that they had never even searched for Beauty and the Beast. The Verge reached out to Google, but the company refused to admit that the audio clip was an ad: “This isn’t an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales,” Google said in a statement. As The Verge notes, Google partners “sharing their tales” with consumers who might want to buy a product or see a movie sure sounds like an ad. The pressure continued to build on Thursday as the story spread, and Google eventually released a second statement: This wasn’t intended to be an ad. What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case. In the end, the “feature” was removed and Google Home stopped serving up ads for Beauty and the Beast. Unfortunately, the genie is now out of the bottle, and while the ads might not be as blatant or intrusive in the future, it’s hard to imagine Google ignoring this potential revenue stream altogether. For now, audio ads appear to be on the shelf, but keep this story in mind next time you think about picking up one of the popular virtual assistants that have already made their way into millions of homes.

This is the shocking video which any child could easily stumble across on Facebook – and which has remained online for more than two years, despite pleas for the web giant to remove it. The disturbing footage has been viewed more than seven million times and is just three clicks away from a simple search using innocuous terms on Google. Anyone who happens upon the film is then confronted with other equally shocking footage, including a mother attacking her traumatised toddler. This is the shocking video which any child could easily stumble across on Facebook – showing a man being viciously stabbed with a 15in knife again and again and left lying in a pool of his blood as he begs for his life When questioned by The Mail on Sunday, Facebook initially tried to justify its hosting of the films. It backed down yesterday and removed the horrific material while it mounted an investigation. Yet late last night the video of the attack reappeared on Facebook before coming down again. Leading politicians condemned the web giant amid the growing furore over the failure of other internet titans including Google and Twitter to remove hate speech, child abuse and other offensive material. Last night, Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘These videos are deeply disturbing as they involve torture, potentially murder, and child abuse. 'Facebook need to now review their entire systems, because these vile videos have been up for years. They need a system that can enforce their own standards the first time around.’ Typing the term 'Facebook video of man...' into Google brought up the top option '...being stabbed' as the website automatically suggests popular searches   It took users to a Facebook page where a 'disgusted' user complained about the video more than two years ago The committee quizzed the web giants last week. Labour MP Ms Cooper said: ‘Facebook admitted to us that their systems didn’t do enough to consider the context of images. The same is true in these cases.’ Media Secretary Karen Bradley said Facebook must ‘take responsibility’ to ensure their platform is not used to ‘celebrate horrendous acts of violence’. The sickening video came up after typing in the search term ‘Facebook video of man…’ on Google. The site’s auto-complete function, which is based on the most popular internet searches, then directed users to the first option ‘…man being stabbed’. Clicking on the top result brought users to a Facebook page where a ‘disgusted’ user complained about the video more than two years ago and provided a link in the hope the social media giant would take it down. The user complained: ‘It is vile that you allow this to be on your website after reviewing!’ The two-minute stabbing video was uploaded in October 2014 by Kim Quaresma, who is understood to be from Rio de Janeiro, with a message which translates as: ‘The drug traffickers do not forgive.’ In the footage, the man is also seen being savagely beaten with a metal pole, his screams muffled by tape across his mouth. One of the attackers, speaking in Portuguese, says: ‘Hey, look at how you end up. You got to take it… he’s a scumbag.’ It is not known whether the victim survived. The clip has been viewed more than 7.2 million times, with more than 120,000 shares, as well as being ‘liked’ 32,000 times. The only warning on the video is a message before users play it which reads: ‘Videos that contain graphic content can shock, offend and upset. Are you sure you want to see this?’ Facebook’s rules allow certain graphic or violent content to be shared only where users are ‘condemning it or raising awareness about it’ – but not when it is ‘shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence’. Such videos are also supposed to be blocked to under-18s, but experts said it was easy to circumvent the restriction. Their defence? The videos 'help' police. So why show film of a convicted child beater?  In October 2014 Quaresma uploaded another graphic video showing a mother repeatedly beating her baby over the head with her hand and a pillow After watching the torture video, web users would have seen on the very same Facebook page this clip of a teenage Malaysian mother repeatedly beating her baby over the head with her hand and a pillow. However the woman involved has reportedly already received an 18-month jail sentence for the attack, making a mockery of Facebook’s defence that such footage could help bring abusers to justice. Among the thousands of comments on the video, some glorify the violence, but others question why Facebook has not removed it. Viewers who check Quaresma’s other videos after watching the brutal attack will see that in October 2014 he uploaded another graphic video showing a mother repeatedly beating her baby over the head with her hand and a pillow as the screaming child rolls around in pain on a bed. The video, lasting more than four minutes, has been viewed 108,000 times and shared nearly 3,000 times. One user commented: ‘I reported this video but yet Facebook have reviewed it and do not think that it contains graphic violence. This is completely wrong.’ Another user wrote: ‘I reported it as well, unbelievable, should be taken down!’ The video is understood to show a teenage Malaysian mother beating her ten-month old child in 2011. The woman reportedly received an 18-month jail sentence. Another clip uploaded by Quaresma in September 2014 shows a boy being beaten by a group with a flip flop and having a rock thrown at his head. The video, believed to have been filmed in Brasilia, has been viewed 119,000 times and shared 1,200 times. As the boy lies on the floor during the attack, his face covered in blood, a Portuguese-speaking man says: ‘You are going to feel the pain, you understand?’ During the video, those beating him suggest that the boy has raped another child, but there is no evidence to support the allegation. The Civil Police in Brasilia told The Mail on Sunday: ‘There is no record of any report matching these facts.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Shocking footage of teenagers kicking and punching school...

Share this article Share Jim Gamble, former chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection unit, said: ‘For this generation of children who are using games like Grand Theft Auto, violence, sexism and extreme violence are being normalised so it creates this confusion in young people’s minds about what is real and what isn’t and what’s legitimate to do and what isn’t.’ Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said: ‘These are multi-billion pound companies who have the resources and expertise to do better. It’s now up to them to make sure their platforms are not used as a place to peddle hate and celebrate horrendous acts of violence.’ After being alerted to the predictive search options by The Mail on Sunday, Google took action to remove the suggested terms from appearing. Facebook initially refused to take down the clips when contacted on Friday, claiming that ‘videos like this may help identify abusers and bring help to victims, and we know that raising awareness of abuse can be an important part of stopping it’. However, yesterday it performed a U-turn and removed the footage while it conducts an investigation. A spokeswoman confirmed the video filmed in Malaysia has been permanently removed. She said: ‘In circumstances like this we mark the videos as disturbing, which means they have a warning screen and are accessible only to people over the age of 18. ‘Following such reports from The Mail on Sunday we have removed the content while we investigate. Where appropriate, we remove instances of videos from Facebook supporting or encouraging these kinds of behaviours.’ Mr Quaresma did not respond to a request for comment.

To expect that the national airline can compete with Emirates and Etihad, when both are completely protected and supported by the UAE government, is illogical and blatantly delusional By:   Syed Bakhtiyar Kazmi 19-Mar-17 1000 Top News ‘Identity card holders can enter Pakistan’ 21-Mar-17 320 ISLAMABAD: The National Databa ... ‘Honour killing is ‘brainchild’ of Gen Zia’ 21-Mar-17 248 ISLAMABAD: Honour killing reached South Asia fr ... A developing economy like Pakistan cannot afford to not have an industrial policy. The policy can be a good policy, a bad policy or a bullshit policy; except that there has to be an industrial policy. According to James Miller, “Any discussion of industrial policy should begin with (the) recognition that we have one. The issue is what type.” On a separate note, I concede that the word ‘bullshit’ has not been used with the panache that first-time usage deserved; my impatience got the better of me! Singapore has one; the aggressive pursuit of which is why they have managed to be the manufacturers and suppliers of high-value components to Multinational Corporation’s supply chain. Japan has one, managed by technocrats, insulated from political pressures, which is why in spite of it’s almost nill resources, the country remains one of the largest exporters of the world. China has one, which is the reason why they are now recognized as the manufacturing backyard of the world. And while too lazy to Google it, I am willing to take a bet that Germany has always had one, South Korea has one and now even Vietnam has one. Historically speaking, even the UK had one, which was aggressively imperialistic and included the colonization of the sub-continent by the East India Company. The repeal of the Corn Laws in the nineteenth century was also used to support the industry, amongst many other policy decisions to protect the domestic industry going bank to Henry I, and only when Britain decided to — or made the mistake of — unilaterally adopting free trade, were they disseated as the industrial power of the world. The Americans had one; tariff, to protect domestic industry, was the second bill signed by George Washington on Independence. Perhaps, the American civil war was also because of tariffs to protect the industry. And once again, the Americans feel the need to have an aggressive industrial policy and have elected President Trump to bring back manufacturing jobs. And does Pakistan have an Industrial Policy? I confess that I was completely ignorant about whether we had one or not, which meant that even if we had one, it was top secret and was, therefore, kept completely confidential. If we did not, industrialization was not amongst the priorities of the Government. Accordingly, the obvious recourse was a Google search, and the results were disheartening. Apparently, we had a 10-year industrial policy covering the period between 2005 and 2015, which based on the current state of exports, was probably not very effective. We apparently have an infrastructure policy and we have a CPEC policy, both of which, in tandem, are enablers for growth. Admittedly, during the construction period, infrastructure projects boost economic activity, but such gains are short term and short lived. Putting it bluntly, we need to have industry, and something to sell internationally, if this entire infrastructure and the CPEC opportunity is to finally bear fruit. Curiously, in fact, surprisingly and encouragingly, the Google search highlighted that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa issued its industrial policy in 2016. I was not aware of this and would like to suggest to its government to actively publicize the policy and proactively establish contact with business houses to generate interest. A bad policy is when you issue one and follow it up with inaction. For the record, the province offers interesting incentives: bearing five percent markup on financing for five years, which nowadays means free debt; financing 25 percent cost of industrial plots; subsidizing 25 percent of transportation costs from Karachi port to industrial site; bearing 25 percent of electricity cost for three years for labour-intensive industry; financing 25 percent of equity for projects set up by female entrepreneurs; and the exemption from custom duties and income tax in certain cases. It would be useful if other provinces followed suite and came out with their own industrial policies, however, unfortunately, provincial industrial policies will always have a pervasive limitation. Without tariff protection, infant industries will remain unable to compete with foreign corporations, who are generally protected by their respective countries and have the resources to sustain a prolonged price war. A favorite example is PIA. To expect that the national airline can compete with Emirates and Etihad, when both are completely protected and supported by the UAE government, is illogical and blatantly delusional. The downside of allowing access to China across the length and breadth of Pakistan is that we have simultaneously and unilaterally opened our market of 200 million Pakistanis to their industry, which can marginalize our own industry purely because of the economies of scale. And to again blast an irksome comment, the Chinese can definitely make cheaper jharoos as well. It is our choice whether we want to support the traders or manufacturers of Pakistan; the former will ultimately derive us over the cliff, no doubts about that. The worryingly growing external debt is the direct outcome of falling exports and increasing trade deficit, curtsey the traders. A careful study proves something, which has been repeated in this column numerous times: economic growth is directly correlated with growth in exports. For the lovers of the infernal GDP, the net trade balance is part of the GDP; qualitative growth is dependent upon the export of manufacturing, all else is an illusion and farcical. Manufacturing remains the quintessential increasing returns industry, agriculture and unskilled manufacturing will always face diminishing returns. In our case textile is our primary export engine, which in turn is dependent on cotton produced; we seem to be stuck around 11 million bales per annum of cotton production for years now and expect to increase our exports! Lately, there has been a lot of jubilation over the decision by Volkswagen to set up an assembly plant in Pakistan; to quote from a book I am at a loss to recall at the moment, “Lego brick manipulation of sophisticated inputs in an unsophisticated way”. The automobile industry, to my knowledge, under the industrial policy — when we did have one — was required to follow a strict deletion regime. How many have complied with that? Something is definitely wrong with our industrial strategy. Exporting mined natural resources or raw produce, while perhaps necessary in the short term, is not a durable policy either; such resources eventually deplete. Since we have decided not to build Kalabagh Dam, and are already water stressed, how long will we be able to keep growing cotton and exporting textile? Random financial incentives to the industry may or may not help. What is needed is a more dynamic approach. As a first step, there is a need to set up an empowered team of experts to understand our declining economic competitiveness and develop an industrial policy, if need be, laced with real incentives for the industry, which are deemed to be the future for Pakistan. Our national market should be used as a leverage against foreign corporations and ultimately a flat tariff across the board to protect domestic manufacture might well be a natural outcome. Without the benefit of complete knowledge, my guess is 30 percent. Irrespective, I sincerely hope that this article becomes a catalyst for an Industrial Policy.   The writer is a chartered accountant based in Islamabad.

That said, new rumors suggest we can expect a rather interesting set of features. According to 9to5Google, the upcoming version will bring changes to notifications, much in the same way Nougat has. It is unclear at the moment what the specifics are, but if we look at Google's forthcoming hybrid Chrome OS / Android operating system, we can see that cross-device notification syncing is a possible addition. Since we know the firm is planning to launch the Pixel 3 during the third quarter, it may not be that big of a stretch to assume aspects of the merged OS would trickle down to Android's upcoming version. Android O is also rumored to bring app icon badges for active notifications, providing an at a glance indication of what you may have missed while you were gone. There's also a so-called "adaptive icons" feature coming, which presumably means icons which change dynamically. This is currently the preserve of the Pixel launcher, which Google has not expressed an intention of bringing to non-Pixel devices. In an effort to improve battery life, the next version of Google's OS will also restrict background activities from apps, much in the same way Chrome 57 currently deals with tabs. It will be interesting to see how much the battery life will be extended as a result of these optimizations. Beyond the features above, a picture-in-picture mode similar to the one currently available in Android TV also seems to be on the cards. This suggests an intention to bring the feature to other devices, such as phones or tablets. ​Another potential feature is one that sounds similar to 'Copy Less', which emerged from a VentureBeat report earlier this month. The main idea is to help the user with 'smarter text selection", employing a floating toolbar with Google Assistant integrated. ​The MediaRecorderAPI (which allows apps to record audio and video, then save it to permanent storage) may also receive some improvements in Android O. No specifics are available at this time, however. Last but not least, "tons of enterprise stuff" is also rumored to be on the way, with no concrete details as to what this may entail. Nevertheless, all will be revealed in May, when Google's I/O Developer Conference kicks off.

Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 is set to rule the tablet market, but from what it seems, Google is catching up fast with the news about Nexus 7 2017. According to the rumors, the Nexus comeback is going to be a big hit. The Tab S3 was unveiled last month at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017 event that took place in Barcelona. Specs Just like the recently announced device, Google Nexus 7 2017 will run on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, with 4 GB RAM and 32 GB storage. Display Samsung Galaxy Tablet S3 comes with a 9.7 inches AMOLED screen that boasts a 1536×2048 pixels resolution. If the reports on this topic are true, Nexus 7 should come with a 7-inches display and a resolution of 2560×1440 pixels. Camera & Battery The Samsung product is expected to come with a 13 MP camera on the back and a 5MP one on the front. It is also endowed with a fingerprint scanner, plus a 6000 mAh battery, which is huge, especially if you take into account the fact that it will offer fast-charging features. Sadly, there is not enough information about these particular specs for the Google Nexus 7 2017 yet, but everybody expects it to be a worthy rival for Samsung Galaxy Tab S3. According to the reports, this is the first Google Nexus device that will be running on the Andromeda OS, which is a hybrid creation between the Chromebook OS and the Android one. We don’t know yet when will Google release its new device, but since it is designed as a rival for Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, most likely it will be launched around the same time. However, many people are skeptical about that, since the Tab S3 model can already be preordered and will start to be shipped on the 24th of March.

It seems like everything that Google is trying to do is going wrong. The Android parent recently pushed March’s security bulletin to its Nexus and Pixel smartphones and instead of enhancing security, this monthly patch managed to cause Nexus 6 to malfunction. In order to repair its mistake, Google is now rolling out a software downgrade to Nexus 6. Nexus 6 goes back to Android 7.0 Nougat A couple of months ago Google pushed Android 7.1.1 Nougat to Nexus 6 as a parting gift, but it looks like Google is not done with Nexus 6 yet. What happened was that when Nexus 6 owners upgraded their operating system with March’s security patch, the smartphone automatically disabled Android Pay. This feature is quite essential and not having access to it is rather annoying. Google’s Product Forum and the Nexus subreddit have been filled with Nexus 6 owners that were reporting this error. On the bright side, this news has reached Google’s ears. Sadly, the Android parent doesn’t have an answer to this issue and decided to roll out a software downgrade that brings Nexus 6 back to the public and stable version of Android 7.0 Nougat. Nexus 6 Community is Confused The entire Nexus 6 community is lashing back at Google for this decision. In fact, many Nexus 6 owners have downloaded the update without reading the details and didn’t know what they were getting into. What’s actually angering the Nexus 6 community is the fact that they were expecting Google to release an OTA (over the air) software fix and not downgrade. In fact, many Nexus 6 owners believe that this downgrade was actually mistakenly rolled out. Google decided to clear up the confusion by posting on its official blog. The Android parent confirmed that this downgrade is no mistake and that all Nexus 6 owners should downgrade their operating system. In addition, Google also stated that once it figures out how to fix the Android Pay bug it will push Android 7.1.1 Nougat once again. Hopefully Google won’t take its time and roll out the update in the upcoming weeks.

The biggest rivalry in the smartphone world used to be the one between Samsung and Apple, but now Google has joined in the race. We think it’s safe to say that Apple’s iPhone 7 is in a league of its own because it runs on iOS, but Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and Google’s Pixel are competing against each other on a daily basis. Customers never know which one deserves their money the most, but today we’re going to try and clear that up by pining Galaxy S7 and Pixel against each other in order to see how well the fare. This brief comparison will be focused on the hardware power these two flagships are offering. Samsung Galaxy S7 vs Google Pixel: Hardware Performance The South Korean tech manufacturer knows that hardware power is very important and that’s why it decided to equip the smartphone with its own octa-core Exynos 8890 chipset. The processor features four cores that clock at 2.3GHz Mongoose and other four ones that have been clocked at 1.6GHz Cortex-A53. Even better, Samsung has coupled the processor with a Mali-T880 MP 12 graphics processing unit and 4GB of RAM. On the other hand we have Pixel, the smartphone is believed to represent Google’s vision of a perfect Android powered smartphone. Now let’s pop up its hood and see what’s fueling Pixel. Unlike Samsung, Google decided to go with one of Qualcomm’s quad-core Snapdragon 821 chipsets. The processor is actually faster than Galaxy S7’s chipset because it has two cores that clock at 2.15GHz Kyro and other two ones that feature a base clock speed of 1.6GHz Kyro. Google decided to spice things up and paired Pixel’s processor with an Adreno 530 graphics processing unit and 4GB of RAM. Samsung Galaxy S7 vs Google Pixel: Verdict After closely inspecting their hardware performance, we can see why these two smartphones fit into the same category. Although many consider them as equals, Pixel has the upper hand. Google has made a wise decision when it chose to collaborate with Qualcomm since its Snapdragon 821 processor is slightly faster than Galaxy S7’s Exynos 8890 chipset.

Seeing the Google started losing interest for its older Nexus handheld devices ever since the Pixel lineup was launched, everyone started believing that Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P are going to be forgotten. The Android parent decided to prove everyone wrong this month when it rolled out March’s security bulletin to both Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. Google has yet to Forget about Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P Even though rumors were pointing towards a Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P discontinuation, it looks like both Google smartphones are not going anywhere. Some actually believe that Google wants to revive these two smartphones in order to boost its sales percentages. The way Google is doing this is by keeping both Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P up to date with all of its latest operating system updates. Pixel doesn’t have the Same Brand Recognition as Nexus As previously mentioned, Google wants to increase its profit revenue by revitalizing Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. The reason why Google is feeling compelled to do that is because neither Pixel nor Pixel XL is selling that well in foreign countries. Both Pixel smartphones are considered as high-quality products but the Pixel brand isn’t globally recognized. This is where Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P come in. Google wants to bring Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P Back The Nexus brand has been alive for a bunch of years now and it has managed to gather quite a large fan-base, especially since it represents the “Pure” Android experience. Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P are selling in large amounts of units in foreign markets such as Europe and Asia and that’s why Google wants to bring them back. What’s interesting is that according to rumors, Pixel’s success is actually hindered by the fact that Nexus 6P is still one of the most desirable Android smartphones. While this might sound like competition, it’s actually not. This is a win-win situation for the Android parent. It can keep Pixel and Pixel XL as premium smartphones while Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P cater to mid-ranged budgets.

The Android parent recently started rolling out an OTA (over the air) update that gives Gmail users the ability to transfer, receive and ask for currency straight from the mobile app. However, this feature is exclusive in the US at the moment but it will probably see a worldwide roll out during the upcoming future. Gmail Receives Google Wallet Features The best thing about this feature is that it’s quite simple to use. Google is renowned for putting a high price on user experience and that’s why its user interfaces are always minimalistic and simple to use. Right now we will go over the process of sending or requesting money with Gmail in order to showcase exactly how simple the process is. Tap on the Gmail icon and then select the Compose button that can be found in the bottom right side; Select the Paper Clip button and then tap on the “Send Money” or “Request Money” options; Now type in the amount of currency that’s going to be sent or requested and tap on the “Continue” button; Gmail will now ask the user to input a payment method such as Debit Card in the Google Wallet app; All that’s left is to type in a memo and select the “Attach Money” option; Additionally, because this is currency transfer or request is basically an email attachment, users will also be required to select a recipient, message and subject. Worth noting is that the recipient doesn’t necessarily have to be a Gmail user or even use Google Wallet. The currency will be transferred straight to the recipient’s Google Wallet account free of charge. Even better if the recipient doesn’t have a Google Wallet account, he can choose to receive the money straight into his bank account also free of charge. Google will also roll out a confirmation email to both the sender and receiver in order to avoid any confusion. To wrap things up, it looks like Gmail will still remain the first the most popular email platform if Google keeps on enhancing it like this.

I’m also not much of an early adopter – I love trying the latest gadgets, but I usually find myself waiting for the second generation of products to arrive before I hop on the bandwagon. Now, I’m irked by the thought of a Google Home speaker playing ads along with its usual programming, as some users found yesterday when Assistant included a promo for Beauty and the Beast while announcing their agenda for the day. New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO — brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY Thanks, but no thanks, Google. It’s bad enough that virtually anything with a screen these days will eventually show you an ad (that’s why I still love and cherish my trusty old 120GB iPod), but speakers too? In a statement to The Verge, Google appeared to suggest that it didn’t intend to begin serving ads through Assistant this way: This wasn’t intended to be an ad. What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case. To be fair, we already come across ads on devices and services we pay for, including ones that are on all the time: our phones, computers, car radios and TVs. And it seems inevitable that promotional content will eventually blare over our smart speakers. The data we feed the companies that make them – by searching the Web and granting access to our email and calendar – already helps flesh out our individual profiles so ads can be targeted to us. As we’ve seen with smartphones, the rapid pace of development in consumer technology seems to be normalizing phenomena that we may not be comfortable with. While we just wanted a better mobile device, we’re now carrying around devices that track and report our every move. It looks like we’ll soon go the same way with speakers. What’s troubling is that it becomes increasingly difficult for people to avoid buying into tech like this, even if they aren’t sold on the implications of the terms of service they signed up for. It won’t be long before we find it odd that people use their phones to shop for things when they can just order stuff by asking Amazon’s Alexa to do so from across the room. While ads on connected speakers feel like a deal breaker right now, they’re probably going to become the norm pretty soon. But hey, maybe we’ll at least get some memorable jingles out of this, like we did with FM radio. Ah, who am I kidding? We’re doomed.

Patrick Reilly Staff | @PatrickfReilly March 18, 2017 —As an al-Shabab militant called for jihad inside Kenya, an ad at the base of his YouTube video urged viewers to “Book Now” for a Sandals tropical vacation. An armed neo-Nazi promoting Combat 18 was paired with a call to volunteer for the hospice charity Marie Curie. Last month, an investigation by The Times of London detailed these as two examples of how major brand names frequently appear alongside hateful YouTube content. A separate article by The Guardian wrote that the UK revenue from these ads amounts to about £250,000, or $318,000, for “extremists and hate preachers.” On Friday, ad agency Havas Media, whose high-profile clients include Hyundai and the Royal Mail, announced that it would stop placing ads on YouTube and its parent company, Google. The tech giant – which commands more than 30 percent of global online ad revenue and draws 90 percent of its own revenue by placing ads – was quick to respond. “We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear,” wrote Google UK managing director Ronan Harris. In recent months, online activists have been targeting offensive Web content by trying to shut off their streams of ad revenue. Havas’s decision marks an early win for this strategy, but could also give a taste of fights to come. In Pictures Keeping watch: security or privacy invasion? “I think that advertisers are becoming wary because they're seeing consumer backlash,” says David Carroll, an associate professor of media design at Parsons New School of Design. Havas’s decision – which it made on behalf of its UK clients – indeed prompted Google to change course. But Professor Carroll, who researches how we use digital media to interact, doesn’t think the playing field has shifted. In a phone interview with The Christian Science Monitor, he observes that, because of the largely-automated, milliseconds-long online advertising process, “advertisers, brands, and publishers [still] have no control over where these ads show up.” When clients’ ads get paired with offensive content, websites “have to act defensively.” When an online ad appears on a racist or terrorist YouTube video, the video’s creator gets most of the revenue, with Google also taking a cut for its role in placing the ad. When it appears on a website like Breitbart – which has been widely accused of spreading fake news and offensive content – most of the money goes to that publisher. If the viewer finds either type of content offensive, Carroll explains, the real losers are the ad firms and and their clients. With the rise of social media, “a new purpose of news is to show other people what you believe in.” This means that, “if people are rejecting a particular publisher because it is spreading what they believe as falsehoods, or is spreading hyper-partisan, very damaging misinformation,” then brands and ad agencies face greater pressure to cut ties with that publication. Applying this pressure has become a new, effective form of consumer activism. One Twitter group, the Sleeping Giants, flags brands whose ads appear on Breitbart. It claims nearly 1,600 ad removals so far. “It's hard to imagine that Havas had not watched the Sleeping Giants thing very closely,” says Carroll. But at the same time, “the only way to solve this problem was through shame.” He expects this pattern of activist groups calling out companies to continue, until a bigger change happens in how companies reach consumer eyeballs via the Web. The fact that a Sandals ad showed up under al-Shabab’s video had little to do with the terrorist group, and more with the vacation preferences of whoever clicked on the video. In the internet era, “ads are no longer placed based on the context,” like a particular magazine for a print ad or a neighborhood for a billboard. Instead, advertising firms focus on “matching ads to people.” As you browse, cookies collect information about which sites you visit. Each ad that you see – including the ones appearing next to this article on the Monitor’s website – reflects those prior habits. These programs don’t just determine the ads that show up next to offensive content; they also help unsavory characters spread that content. As Carroll puts it, the "technology that matches your preference [for] laundry detergent is the same technology that matches a hyper-partisan inflammatory falsehood that you're going to share on your streams because you want to believe it.” Is an end to these practices in sight? If so, it could come next year, when a new set of EU data-protection laws is scheduled to take effect. The new codes – likely to affect US companies – switch from a system where “you having to know who's collecting data about you, and opt out of it,” to a model where the internet user has to opt in to a data-collection operation. That may not sound like much, but Carroll thinks it could help internet users discern good and bad forms of data collection – and, in doing so, push “a lot of the bad actors out of the marketplace – and restore “highly-trusted relationships between users, companies, publishers, and advertisers.” Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign Up × For this reason, he thinks Havas and its competitors have a major stake in letting the new law take effect, and relying less on user data collection. “Realize how bad things are,” he advises, “and look for the opportunity to fix this, rather than see this as just another crisis.” Did this story deliver on 'values & ideals'?    Thanks for your feedback.

All major companies have announced that they are preparing to launch their flagship smartphones during the upcoming future. Although the entire world is talking about Samsung’s Galaxy 8 and Apple’s iPhone 8, Google is also preparing something big. In fact, the company’s Vice President attended MWC and announced that the upcoming Pixel 2 will “stay premium”. We can’t know for sure what this means but we think it’s safe to say that the upcoming Google smartphone will be able to take on both Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8. Three Pixel 2 Smartphones The Android parent has done a good job of keeping its mouth shut when asked about its upcoming smartphone but, rumor has it that there will be three Pixel 2 devices and not just one. A couple of days ago two Google smartphone codenames have been leaked, Muskie and Walleye. These two devices are expected to be Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL but what’s interesting is that another code name has surfaced. Muskie, Walleye and Taimen According to rumors and speculations, the third Pixel smartphone has been codenamed as Taimen. Just like Muskie and Walleye, the third Pixel device has also been codenamed after a fish. The entire Android community believes that Taimen is actually going to be a more affordable Pixel 2. This goes hand in hand with previous rumors that were pointing out the fact that Google wants to capitalize on mid-ranged budgets. Last year, Google adopted the size format that Samsung and Apple use and launched Pixel in two sizes. Well, it looks like this year we’re in for a third Pixel smartphone. This is actually great news since not everyone is able to afford a $759.00 phone. The Android parent is probably going to equip this affordable Pixel model with a smaller display and lower amount of RAM so that it’s able to reduce its price. Nonetheless, everyone doubted that Google will be able to make it on its own on the smartphone market when it decided to part ways with Huawei but Google proved everyone wrong. Pixel and Pixel XL are considered as being some of the best Android powered smartphones ever made.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS What we can learn about the future of meetings from Google John Brandon@jmbrandonbb March 18, 2017 1:15 PM Tags: ai, bots, chatbots, Google, Hangouts Chat, machine learning Image Credit: Google I process meeting requests all day, especially on Fridays (when I typically hold a few phone briefings and meet with volunteers at a local college). You’d think someone would have figured out how to improve this process in the time since my corporate career ended around 2001. Back then, I sat through countless meetings every day…all day long. You can feel sorry for me now. My “other” full-time job at the time was adjusting my schedule. It was often difficult to know who was actually available and in the office, even if Outlook gave me a few clues. No one had invented a sensor for tracking the boss. These days, a few apps help somewhat, but they live on their own outside of my normal routines — a.k.a., using Gmail and Google Cal. I can chat all day on Slack, but meetings are not really part of that ritual. I still have to manually add meetings and manage them in my Google Calendar. I know I could use X.ai, but that uses email — yet another app. In a recent demo, a Google rep explained to me how Hangouts Chat could change that, and it made me think of many other novel ways a bot could all but remove the tedium of managing a daily schedule. The @meet bot from Hangouts is nothing special. You tag the bot and name a day and time, and the bot sifts through everyone’s schedule and finds an open slot, then books the meeting. What impressed me about it wasn’t the actual feature set (which includes an option to hold a meeting right now and creates a Hangouts link) but the possibility for what could come next. The bot uses some basic machine learning. In the demo, the rep showed how the bot can see who is in the chat and make sure everyone is on the invite list. It can scan the schedules for everyone involved because the chat tool runs in G Suite, the office version of Gmail and Google Calendar. It’s a bit like having an assistant who does the meeting invites. But I want it to go much further. I’d like to activate the bot before the discussion starts, tagging @meet so that it watches what we say and then jumps in and suggests a meeting time when we start talking about needing to meet. It could constantly look for the words meeting and meet in every Hangouts Chat channel. That might be helpful, but the bot could then use more machine learning to parse the conversation even further. How about noting that one of the participants is actually a contractor and never attends any meetings? Skip that person on the next one. Or the bot could split us into two different meeting groups when it sees that some of us are in marketing and some are in sales. It could also look at conference rooms. In the office with the college volunteers, we use a tool called Ad Astra to book conference rooms. It’s old tech. I’d like the @meet bot to look at who is chatting and find an open room that’s closest to everyone involved. Maybe it can learn that we normally book rooms with larger windows, or that the exec who attends these meetings prefers the space next to the coffee machines. It’s not that hard. When the exec types “I prefer to meet in the space next to the coffee machines,” keeping track of that is not a Herculean challenge for a bot. And all of this is something that would occur in the background. We’d never have to think about meeting requests at all. We’d have a bot that manages meetings, arranges them, notifies us about them, adjusts them — we’d simply have to show up. Hopefully, Google will make this happen soon.

Onalytica With Onalytica you will know the most relevant digital influencers for your content, which will give you a competitive advantage to influence their sizeable networks. You can share your content with them safe in the knowledge that they are posting very similar content and are therefore more likely to share your content with their social media following. Onalytica matches the proportional usage of nouns in your content against an aggregate of what an influencer has posted on Twitter over the past 12 months to return the most relevant influencers. This will identify many more relevant influencers than keyword searching across social media listening tools. Facebook Insights If you’re marketing on Facebook, you might be concerned about the competition and the question whether the advertising there is worth the investment. We think you should be using Facebook Insights. One of the most beneficial features of this tool is that it can help you understand the behavior of your customers. For example, you can create a schedule based on the time or day of the week that your customers are most active on Facebook.

Persona creating tools Personapp Would you like to visualize your audience? Personapp allows you to create and share quick, lightweight personas using a simple lean framework. It’s useful to create these low–fi personas with your clients at your kick-off meeting for a new project. It also allows you to start the process for user involvement at an early stage without any friction. Once you’ve created these personas (usually 4 or 5 to start off with), you then validate these through in-depth user interviews and then re–visit them after your research to determine which assumptions still stand and which can be binned. Rather than doing these on paper or hacked using Word, Fireworks or similar, it would be useful to have a simple web interface to create these and collaborate on them with clients (remotely if necessary). BuzzBundle Create and manage multiple personas for all people you have to present. BuzzBundle supports Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, YouTube, forums and blogs. Comment in blogs or forums, retweet, reply, and send private messages. Quick-search your conversations, remove any messages; customize the data to display and more.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ARVR Guest WebVR isn’t sexy, but it will change the game for VR this year Amir-Esmaeil Bozorgzadeh@whiteboxamir March 18, 2017 12:10 PM Tags: A-Frame, Amir-Esmaeil Bozorgzadeh, BabylonJSor, gravr, PlayCanvas, PrimroseVR, ReactVR, Roland Dubois, Vizor, WebVR, Zeovr Above: From A-Frame's image gallery at https://aframe.io Events have taken a dramatic turn since I published an article last September on how WebVR, the JavaScript API that allows immersive VR experiences to be played straight from your web browser, will make virtual reality massively available. Back then the only big player that was generating some appreciable degree of buzz was the pioneer itself, Mozilla, with their WebVR open source library, A-Frame. But in the past several months news began to roll out from the likes of Google, Samsung, Microsoft, and Oculus, each giant announcing advances in powering up their browsers with WebVR. “We are now capable of creating VR content that is available on the most widespread medium in existence by simply sharing a URL,” Diego Gonzalez, Developer Advocate for Samsung Internet told me. Last month Google announced that Chrome now supports WebVR on Daydream-ready Android devices and that they’re in the process of broadening that access to include desktop operating systems, which will be a huge stepping stone for companies interested in leveraging VR on the web. Google’s UX Lead for WebVR Josh Carpenter explained the company’s motivation: “Volume of content matters. The ability for anyone to create and publish their vision matters. We view the web as a complement to native virtual reality, helping create new types of content, with wide distribution, and no-friction consumption.” Other WebVR-friendly browsers include Samsung’s Internet browser, available on its Gear VR headset, Microsoft’s preview version for its Edge browser, and the Firefox Nightly browser. Oculus is building its own native WebVR browser, coined Carmel, which is available in the developer preview — we’ll surely hear more about as we approach the F8 developer conference coming up next month. Above: WebVR Minecraft demo built in A-Frame. “We believe WebVR is one of the crucial ways to drive adoption for VR because it promises to exponentially increase the number of developers building great content,” Oculus’ WebVR product manager Andrew Mo told me. “And the cross-platform nature of WebVR enables users to easily share and connect with their friends outside VR and show them what they are missing.” Holding true to the nature of the web as a garden without walls or fences, there are a variety of WebVR frameworks that developers can work with aside from A-Frame. Vizor, PlayCanvas, and BabylonJSor are popular along with VR developer engines like PrimroseVR and Zeovr. Oculus’ own open source library, ReactVR, is available as a pre-release. “The beauty of WebVR is that it works on many platforms now with many more on the way, and tools like A-Frame mean that creative self-expression has been opened up to more people around the globe. Sharing is as fast and simple as sharing a web page, and it’s open to anybody,” Mozilla SVP of Emerging Technologies Sean White told me via email. “Now that others have joined in, we hope they will develop their tools and applications in such a way that will ensure they remain relatively easy to standardize and can be supported on multiple browsers and VR headsets.” WebVR has the inherent potential to grow like wildfire because it is frictionless by design. No downloads. No installs. No locks or keys. No queuing in front of some arbitrary bouncer. It’s the fastest way to build and share VR content, sidestepping the walled gardens that have popped up, feebly trying to segregate audiences before they even appear and hoping to copy and paste the old app store business model onto an emerging ecosystem. WebVR is also the easiest way to learn VR, thanks to its open source DNA, which makes it both more available and better able to drawing in and onboard a wide pool of talent. “Now you see something on this web page and you wonder how it is done, what can you do about it? Display the source. You can now study how a nice visual effect was done, copy-paste it, modify it, break it, fix it, adapt it to your own need,” Fabien Benetou, a WebVR developer well known in the A-Frame community, told me. “Thanks to this, WebVR is the most efficient way to learn VR.” Only HTC appears to be slow, or too stubborn, to join the party, and I have a working hypothesis. WebVR isn’t sexy. At least not yet. In fact, at this stage in its development, it often looks like VR from the ’80s and ’90s, particularly because the developer community isn’t prioritizing consumer-facing applications quite yet. WebVR isn’t going to immediately offer the kind of high-fidelity experiences that the industry has been hyping up as a lure to ignite consumer adoption. And it’s not yet capable of servicing the high-octane gaming and entertainment experiences that are being touted as the primary appeal of VR to the mainstream. WebVR does, however, promise a broad, versatile, and far reaching impact on various industries already firmly rooted in the web. Think about any web-based industry and you can easily imagine a WebVR extension to enhance the value-add and bottom line. Think media: You could be reading a news article about an event taking place in a city on the other side of the world and immediately be able to load up the specific environment and circumstance in VR, without ever leaving your browsing experience. Or e-commerce: You could jump into a brief guided tour of that same city while considering the ticket costs of booking a flight. How about consumer goods? You can get a good feel for WebVR’s sober approach by looking at the fruits of the WebVR Hackathon run by Aquinas Training in NYC back in December. One of its champions, Roland Dubois, won the best app category with “gravr — A Globally Recognized Avatar for VR on the web”, a VR profile API that follows a user from VR experience to VR experience, customized to them and based on their hardware and real-life environment. Above: Roland Dubois’ gravr concept, “A Globally Recognized Avatar for VR on the Web” Dubois’ work highlights one particularly awesome aspect of WebVR: It provides the building blocks for what developers are calling the Metaverse, an interconnected virtual world where users can travel from one immersive experience to the next, like walking through an infinite series of doors that take you through an endlessly growing virtual universe. Here’s how Thomas Balouet, cofounder of WebVR-based startup LucidWeb, explains it: “You know that feeling you have when you just want to check a cooking recipe on the Internet, and two hours later you’re reading an article about Patagonia on Wikipedia? Well, imagine you put on your headset to watch a cool relaxing experience, and 15 minutes later you find yourself talking with friends on top of a mountain or flying over your home town. That’s what the Metaverse would be, and this kind of situation would be possible only with deep-linking, one place bringing you to another one related to it, without you having to come back to a common place, or even realizing you’re leaving the first place. Only WebVR can enable that.” Being in the VR industry, I hear a lot about the search for the killer VR app — an app that will finally get mainstream users flocking to VR. Well, maybe we’re looking in the wrong place for that trigger. Maybe it’s not an app that we should be looking for but a platform that offers a paradigm shift, fuelled by the web. An interconnected array of virtual reality experiences, tools, and products could blow our collective minds. Amir-Esmaeil Bozorgzadeh is the cofounder at Virtuleap, a sandbox for creative developers to showcase their VR concepts. He is also the European Partner at Edoramedia, a games publisher and digital agency with headquarters in Dubai. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

The unique virtual helping hand is Google's newest take to crack down Apple's similar assisting agent: Siri. But several users of Android-based tablets raised their query about Google Assistant's unavailability on their devices. Most of them, having tablets running on Nougat or Marshmallow, the haven't received any update or pop-up in the recent timeline for enabling Google Assistant. The confusion created among them about it has finally been clarified by Google itself. According to Android Police, Google stated that currently, the company is rolling out Google assistant to Android led smartphones only. The Android-running tablets won't be a part of this lineup. The company authority exclaimed: "The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play Services, this does not include tablets." Just after this declaration was officially announced, many analysts and experts came up with their own version of reasons for this sudden take, but the following potential source rightly defined the cause of such decision made by Google. As per a report by The Verge, Google may be possibly trying to have a slow move with Google Assistant. It should be noted in this context that the company took months to roll out its supreme assisting agent to Android smartphones other than that of Google's very own Pixel range. Similarly, as Android phones are more popular among tech fans than Android tablets. So, may be to focus more on its usability and the level of appreciation among Android handset users, Google is holding back the official roll-out of Google Assistant on other Android led devices. Advertisement As far as the specs are concerned, Google Assistant can be considered as a potential replacement to Google Search App. Although, the agent still needs to be upgraded a bit more. There are certain backlogs witnessed with the agent like Google Assitant's inability to recognise songs, reading messages, assign tasks etc. Hopefully, Google would sort these out quickly alongside bringing up some more usefulness of its newest agent.

This results in dramatically faster large-scale analytics and transactions without significantly increasing development and management overhead. Get the GridGain White Paper. Google on Thursday announced Guetzli, a new contribution to its evolving set of tools for the open source community. Guetzli is an encoder that allows JPEG files to be compressed as much as 35 percent, resulting in much faster Web page loading. "Guetzli," which means "cookie" in Swiss German, allows users to create smaller JPEG images while maintaining compatibility with existing Web browsers, image processing applications and the existing JPEG standard, noted Robert Obryk and Jyrki Alakuijala, software engineers at Google Research Europe, in an online post. It produces a result similar to that of Google's Zopfli algorithm, which produces smaller PNG and gzip files without the requirement of a new file format, they explained. The technique is different from RNN-based image compression, RAISR and WebP, all of which need ecosystem and client changes for compression at Internet scale. Google first introduced the Zopfi compression algorithm in 2013 and two years later unveiled Brotli, which offered faster page loads and up to 26 percent higher compression ratios than Zopfi. Microsoft late last year announced support for Brotli in Edge, which would make it broadly interoperable across major browsers, as the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox already supported Brotli. Quality and Compression JPEG resolution quality is directly correlated to its multi-stage compression process, Obryk and Alakuijala explained. "Guetzli specifically targets the quantization stage in which the more visual quality loss is introduced, the smaller resulting file," they wrote. "Guetzli strikes a balance between minimal loss and file size by employing a search algorithm that tries to overcome the difference between psychovisual modeling of JPEG's format and Guetzli's psychovisual model." The model approximates color perception and visual masking in a more detailed way than what can be achieved through simpler color transforms and discrete cosine transforms, according to the engineers. 16x16 pixel synthetic example of a phone line hanging against a blue sky -- traditionally a case where JPEG compression algorithms suffer from artifacts. Uncompressed original is on the left. Guetzli (on the right) shows less ringing artefacts than libjpeg (middle) and has a smaller file size. During experiments with human raters, Obryk and Alakuijala continued, images produced by Guetzli were preferred over images from libjpeg files, even when the latter files were the same size or slightly larger, making the slower compression a worthy tradeoff. 20x24 pixel zoomed areas from a picture of a cat's eye. Uncompressed original on the left. Guetzli (on the right) shows less ringing artefacts than libjpeg (middle) without requiring a larger file size. The hope is that the format webmasters and graphic designers will embrace the format for running image-heavy websites, and that mobile users will see reduced load times and bandwidth costs, the engineers said. Deep Learning Google likely has developed the deep learning expertise and compute resources to tackle such a feat from a new vantage point, suggested Paul Teich, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Image storage is a top priority for consumer cloud services, retail, advertising and other industries, he noted. "My educated guess is that Google made Guetzli public because Google doesn't control most of the endpoints that capture the images that Google then stores for image searches," Teich told LinuxInsider. "It makes Google's business run a little better if everyone uses Guetzli as their native JPEG format -- and the same is true for other cloud services that handle images at scale, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram." There likely will be a version of Guetzli for motion video compression as well. RAISR, which Google introduced in November, uses machine learning to turn low-resolution images into high-quality photos. WebP images are 26 percent smaller than PNGs and up to 34 percent smaller than JPEG images Making the Guetzli technology available as an open source tool will help speed adoption and return significant benefits for Google, said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "Google makes money off ads," he told LinuxInsider. "Slow load times lower ad views, so by speeding up the Web, they'll make a ton more money." Dropbox engineers were excited to find that Guetzli interoperates with Lepton, the streaming image compression format Dropbox released to the open source community last summer. "In preliminary testing, we are seeing real advantages in combining Guetzli with Lepton, as long as you apply Guetzli first," said Daniel Reiter Horn, staff software engineer at Dropbox. "For example, one test we tried resulted in ~24 percent savings from Guetzli and an additional ~22 percent compression from Lepton, with default settings," he told LinuxInsider. "The result was a total savings of ~41 percent over the default file," Horn said. "The math makes sense, because Lepton gives 22 percent savings on the Guetzli file that's 75 percent of the original size... so the savings is 24 percent + (22 percent * 76 percent) = ~41 percent." Google's own team had little to say about the release beyond the revelations in Obryk and Alakuijala's post, company rep Jason Freidenfelds told LinuxInsider. However, it did release a statement suggesting that it was, shall we say, compressing its wild enthusiasm: "Grt to hv all ths intrst - w'r vry exctd fr ths brkthrgh!"

The company will also be offering a free Google Home speaker hub with pre-orders of LG's new flagship phone - but rival US carriers are hoping to tempt buyers with even more enticing deals. Verizon and Sprint are also giving away a free Google Home with pre-orders of the G6, but on top of that, they're offering buyers a free HDTV with the device too. Verizon has opened pre-orders for the G6 priced at $672 up front, or $28 per month on a two-year plan. In addition to the free speaker, powered by Google Assistant, Verizon is also offering buyers a free 43-inch Smart TV for customers who switch to the carrier, or add a new line to their existing account, and add an unlimited plan. Sprint is also accepting pre-orders for the G6, but at a higher price. The handset will cost $708 up front, or you can pay $29.50 a month over two years. While the device costs more on Sprint, you'll still get the free Google Home, and the carrier is also offering a free 49-inch LG HDTV worth $349.99, as part of the package. AT&T is charging the most of any major US carrier, having priced the G6 at $719.99 up front, or $24 a month on a 30-month plan. An alternative plan is available, costing $30 per month for the handset over 24 months instead. As Mashable explained, along with the Google Home speaker, AT&T is offering a second free G6 if you pay for the first one in full and add a new line on AT&T Next. And if you sign up to a two-year AT&T Next agreement, AT&T will also offer you an LG Watch Sport, worth $349, for $49.99. There are plenty of options for those wishing to buy LG's new high-end handset in the US, and the biggest carriers are clearly eager to lure G6 buyers in their direction.

 Everything you need to know about the Google lawsuit that could derail Uber's future Steve Kovach Mar. 18, 2017, 8:00 AM 23,384 facebook linkedin twitter email print Anthony Levandowsk, Uber's self-driving car boss.YouTube The first self-driving car prototypes are already navigating the roads in a few cities. But the real action is about to take place in the courtroom.  Google and Uber, the two giants at the forefront of developing the technology, are vying to own the emerging market and to suck up the profits. The stakes are high and the fight is already getting personal, with Google accusing one of its star engineers of stealing some of its crown jewels.  Last month, Waymo, the self-driving company owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, sued Uber, claiming that one of its employees stole vital technology shortly before starting his own self-driving company (which Uber later acquired). Autonomous cars have the potential to upend massive industries ranging from transportation to auto manufacturing. For Google and Uber, the opportunity and the threat posed by a world of self-driving vehicles is huge. Google has been developing self-driving technology for the better part of a decade, and plans to license that technology to other car companies through Waymo. There's also a chance Waymo will eventually develop its own ride-hailing service powered by self-driving cars to compete directly with Uber. Uber only recently began exploring self-driving technology, but sees it as the next logical step to protect its business. One of the company's biggest expenses comes from giving drivers a share of the revenue generated on each ride. Cutting out the drivers in favor of self-driving cars would be huge for Uber's bottom line. (And, of course, bad for the drivers who rely on Uber to make a living.) If someone else beats Uber to that self-driving future, Uber will be at a major, perhaps fatal, disadvantage. The trade secrets case is shaping up to be one of the most significant and closely-watched battles in Silicon Valley in years, pitting two of the world's most powerful companies, and former partners, against each other. There's still a long way to go before it's resolved, but here's everything you need to know about what's happened so far. Who's involved? A Waymo self-driving car.waymo.com Waymo. Last year, Google's self-driving car project spun out of X, the Alphabet division that dreams up "moonshot" projects like internet balloons and delivery drones. The new company is called Waymo and licenses its technology to other car companies that want to build self-driving cars. Waymo has already partnered with Fiat Chrysler, however it's a technical partnership. Waymo isn't licensing its technology to Fiat Chrysler. Waymo has also said it plans to work with Honda on self-driving cars. Uber. Uber, the ride-hailing company valued at $69 billion in the private market, is developing self-driving cars, which it believes will one day replace most of its human drivers. Anthony Levandowski. Levandowski is Uber's self-driving car boss. He was a top executive in Google's self-driving car division and left in 2016 to start Otto, a self-driving truck startup. Otto. Otto was bought by Uber last year, a bet by Uber on self-driving cars as well as an effort by the company to expand into the logistics business with self-driving cargo trucks. Waymo's claims Waymo accuses Uber and Otto of stealing its lidar technology. Lidar is the sensor on self-driving cars that allow them to "see" the world as they drive themselves. It's an essential component for self-driving vehicles. Waymo's lawsuit says that Levandowski downloaded 9.7 gigabytes of files containing information about the company's self-driving technology to his laptop and then transferred those files to another external storage device. Those files included plans for Waymo's proprietary lidar system, Waymo says. Levandowski left Google's self-driving division in January of 2016, weeks after downloading the files, Waymo says. He later went on to start Otto, which Uber bought six months later. Levandowski became the head of Uber's self-driving efforts. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick with Anthony Levandowski.Associated Press Waymo says it was accidentally sent an email from one of Uber/Otto's suppliers for lidar equipment late in 2016. The lidar designs in the email "bore a striking resemblance to Waymo’s unique lidar design," Waymo says. This caused Waymo to investigate Levandowski's final weeks at Waymo, and the company says it discovered evidence that he downloaded the files to the external device. In addition to the lawsuit it filed in February, Waymo asked a judge last week to put a ban on Uber's self-driving car projects until the case is resolved. Uber's defense Uber hasn't issued a formal, legal response to Waymo's lawsuit yet, though it is expected to in the coming weeks. However, according to a Bloomberg report published Thursday, we have an idea one of Uber's potential defenses. According to the report, Levandowski told his staff that Uber's lidar technology is "clean" and that he downloaded those files to his computer so that he could work from home. Uber has only called Waymo's accusations a "baseless attempt to slow down a competitor." Alphabet's ties to Uber There's another piece to the puzzle. Alphabet has made significant investments in Uber. In a strange way, Uber's success also financially benefits Alphabet. In 2013, Google Ventures (now simply called GV), invested $258 million in Uber. That investment, which had Uber valued at $3.5 billion at the time, gave GV about a 7% stake in the company, Kara Swisher reported at the time, writing for AllThingsD. Uber is now valued at approximately $69 billion, according to most estimates. An Alphabet executive, David Drummond, also used to be on Uber's board, but left in August of 2016 once it became clear the two companies were competing in the same space. Alphabet's David Drummond left Uber's board in August.Andreas Rentz/Getty Images What's next? The next major development will be Uber's legal filing responding to Waymo's lawsuit. The judge in the case has given Uber until April 7 to file, but Uber's lawyer said it's coming within the next two weeks. So far, we don't know much about how Uber will respond, but it seems likely it'll want to use Levandowski's defense that he downloaded the files to his computer so he could work from home.

Images look better, too. Sebastian Anthony - Mar 17, 2017 11:41 am UTC Enlarge / This image has not been run through Google's new JPEG encoder. But that doesn't make it any less magical. Harry Langdon/Getty Images reader comments 150 Share this story Google has developed and open-sourced a new JPEG algorithm that reduces file size by about 35 percent—or alternatively, image quality can be significantly improved while keeping file size constant. Importantly, and unlike some of its other efforts in image compression (WebP, WebM), Google's new JPEGs are completely compatible with existing browsers, devices, photo editing apps, and the JPEG standard. The new JPEG encoder is called Guetzli, which is Swiss German for cookie (the project was led by Google Research's Zurich office). Don't pay too much attention to the name: after extensive analysis, I can't find anything in the Github repository related to cookies or indeed any other baked good. There are numerous ways of tweaking JPEG image quality and file size, but Guetzli focuses on the quantization stage of compression. Put simply, quantization is a process that tries to reduce a large amount of disordered data, which is hard to compress, into ordered data, which is very easy to compress. In JPEG encoding, this process usually reduces gentle colour gradients to single blocks of colour and often obliterates small details entirely. Further ReadingGoogle AI invents its own cryptographic algorithm; no one knows how it worksThe difficult bit is finding a balance between removing detail, and keeping file size down. Every lossy encoder (libjpeg, x264, lame) does it differently. Guetzli, according to Google Research, uses a new psychovisual model—called Butteraugli, if you must know—to work out which colours and details to keep, and which to throw away. "Psychovisual" in this case means it's based on the human visual processing system. The exact details of Butteraugli are buried within hundreds of high-precision constants, which produce a model that "approximates colour perception and visual masking in a more thorough and detailed way" than other encoders. What we don't know, however, is how Google Research worked out those high-precision constants. They seem to be computer-generated, or at least computer-optimised. Google Research has a thing for neural networks and machine learning: perhaps a huge corpus of images was pushed through a neural net and a more nuanced and accurate psychovisual model came out the other end? Original image on the left, libjpeg in the middle, Guetzli on the right. You can see fewer artifacts in the Guetzli example, and the file size is smaller. Original image on the left, libjpeg in the middle, Guetzli on the right. While the primary use case of Guetzli will be reducing file size, Google Research reckons it can also be used to increase the perceived quality of JPEGs while keeping the file size the same. When comparing Guetzli-encoded images against libjpeg (a popular open-source encoder), "75 percent of ratings are in favour of Guetzli. This implies the Butteraugli psychovisual image similarity metric which guides Guetzli is reasonably close to human perception at high quality levels." Further ReadingGoogle Brain super-resolution image tech makes “zoom, enhance!” a real thingIn any case, the proof of a new algorithm is in the eating. Guetzli is freely available to download from Github. Web masters, graphic designers, and photographers are free to give it a go—or not. It's also worth noting at this point that encoding images with Guetzli, due to the more involved quantization process, is slower than libjpeg. Unlike so many other previous attempts at shaking up image compression, though, at least Guetzli should be compatible with existing browsers and devices. Now read about Google's "zoom, enhance!" algorithm that creates detailed images from tiny, pixelated source images... Sebastian Anthony Sebastian is the editor of Ars Technica UK.

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. Google has made it official that it will no longer provide Nexus 6 with operating system updates. This was to be expected since the smartphone was launched back in 2014 and Google always tends to leave behind smartphones that have reached their two year milestone. On the bright side though, Google will keep on rolling out security patches to Nexus 6 all throughout 2017. Nexus 6 Receives March Security Patch Usually, when Google starts rolling out its monthly patches the entire Nexus community is happy. Well, this isn’t the case with the March security bulletin. Google’s Product Forum is filled with threads made by Nexus 6 owners who are complaining about the fact that after they updated their security, the smartphone started malfunctioning. March Security Patch Brings Unexpected Bug According to all the aforementioned forum threads, Nexus 6 is no longer able to pass the SafetyNet test. This is quite important since the sole purpose of this test is to make sure if the designated device is secure enough to perform mobile banking or payments. Therefore, Nexus 6 owners are no longer allowed to access Android Pay. Google to Roll Out OTA Fix Although this month’s security patch takes care of 60 system vulnerabilities, Nexus 6 owners are advised to avoid this update. Nexus 6 owners shouldn’t worry if they already managed to update their device. This issue has definitely reached Google’s ears and the Android parent is surely going to roll out an OTA (over the air) fix to all the affected devices. The Android parent has rolled the incremental security update OTA and it arrives under the “N6F62U” build number for Nexus 6 devices. Sadly, even though Google stresses the fact that it puts a high price on security some exploits and bugs such as this one still manage to slip through the cracks. Actually, the March security patch fixes one major exploit which allowed hackers to remotely get access to Android powered smartphones. We can be sure that this type of issues will not happen again in the future. Google always learns from its mistakes and doesn’t repeat them.

Even though Google didn’t unveil any important information about this year’s Pixel lineup, we do know that both of them are going to stay premium. This information was provided by Google’s Senior Vice President Rick Osterloh during the Mobile World Congress. The reason we are talking today about Google’s upcoming smartphones is because their codenames have been unveiled. Google Pixel and Pixel XL have been Codenamed “Walleye” and “Muskie” These two interesting codenames have been spotted on Google’s Android Open Source Project gerrit. However, the gerrit only contained “Walleye”. We should mention that this isn’t the first time the Android parent codenames its devices. The already existing Pixel and Pixel XL used to be known as “Marlin” and “Sailfish”. Additionally, the gerrit only contained Marlin and Sailfish was unveiled later. The codenames leads us to believe that Google is sticking to the two size format. This shouldn’t surprise anyone since both Samsung and Apple have been using the same product format with their Plus variants. Rumor has it that Muskie is the XL Pixel variant and Walleye is the standard model. Google Pixel 2 Rumors and Speculations As previously mentioned, the Android parent has been keeping mouth shut when asked about Pixel 2. However, this didn’t stop the entire Android community from speculating and sparking rumors about Pixel 2. We have gathered the most reoccurring ones and we’re going to list them right now. Speculations are pointing towards the fact that Pixel 2 will also be a camera centric smartphone. This is great news since the already existing model is renowned throughout the entire world for sporting a highly optimized rear camera. Additionally as Rick Osterloh stated, Pixel 2 will stay premium. This means that Google will equip the smartphone with the best hardware parts available on the market. Tech experts believe that Google will use Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 processor. If this proves to be true, the smartphone will be significantly more powerful than its predecessor. Also, rumor has it that Pixel 2 will ship without the classic 3.5mm audio jack. Google will opt for a USB Type-C port instead.

Google Earth is an innovating service that was introduced to the world more than a decade ago. Since then, people have been using Google Earth in a number of ways, learning about the world as it is in real time and exploring places they never thought they’d see. Google has become known over the years as a company you can expect to innovate and refresh the industry thanks to its various services and products that have changed the tech market forever. Just when you though it couldn’t get better, Google returns with a revisited version of Google Earth. Taking advantage of the current virtual reality craze which took the market by storm and stole the show, Google introduced Google Earth VR. Google Earth VR’s name doesn’t leave much room for imagination, and yes, it’s exactly what you think it could be. Through the power of virtual reality, Google is giving people a chance to personally experience being in places around the globe. Through Google VR, people are able to float above the Grand Canyon or walk the streets of Paris. Of course, there’s only so much technology can do, and living the real experience will no doubt be a thousand times better. That being said, the opportunity Google is introducing shouldn’t be dismissed. It can be a great learning tool as well, especially for children. You can imagine conversations between kids and their parents where the child says the learned about the Great Wall of Chine. And the parent replies: “Do you want to go check it out?”. Today, technology has reached a level where it is deeply incorporated into our society and way of life. This allows us to do extraordinary things and enjoy things that weren’t imaginable just a few years ago. As technology continues to evolve, so does society and the opportunities it presents. Through companies like Google which constantly research and innovate, mankind can reach amazing heights.

The most talked about subject in the Android community is March’s Android security bulletin. Even though Google has developed this monthly patch so that Nexus 6’s overall security level is enhanced, Nexus 6 owners soon found out that March’s security bulletin has done something more. After updating the smartphone, Android Pay was automatically disabled on Nexus 6 devices. Android March Security Bulletin Disables Android Pay All Android powered smartphones have to pass the SafetyNet test so that mobile banking and online payments are permitted. Sadly, SafetyNet doesn’t recognize this month’s security patch and sees it as a threat. This is why Nexus 6 owners are not allowed to access Android Pay anymore. Fortunately, this news has reached Google’s ears. Google Isn’t Able to Find a Solution In order to get rid of this issue, Google started rolling out an operating system downgrade to Nexus 6 smartphones. The update brings the designated devices back to the stable public version of Android 7.0 Nougat. On the downside though, it looks like Google has yet to find a solution The Nexus Community manager has even went on Reddit and urged Nexus 6 owners to downgrade their smartphone’s operating system. It doesn’t sound like we are going to see a OTA (over the air) software fix any time soon. Additionally, the Nexus Community manager has also stated that if the device still presents the same issue even after downgrading its operating system, Nexus 6 owners should just perform a factory reset. When can we Expect a Software Fix? Sadly, Google has announced that it’s not able to guarantee to confirm an official date. It’s surprising how this security update managed to mess things up so bad. Even though Google stresses the fact that user security is its top priority, bugs and glitches such as this one still manage to slip through the cracks. Although, taking in consideration the fact that Google has one of the largest developer team we can be sure that a software fix will arrive during the upcoming weeks. Until then, we advise Nexus 6 owners who have yet to upgrade their operating system to just avoid it.

It goes without saying that the word “offensive” is a subjective term that can mean many different things to many different people; what Sally finds offensive may not be offensive to Joe, and vice versa. Because of the term’s lack of definition, it is up to us to give it definition. This is dangerous because it invites people to use the word in a way that best suits their own biases or agendas. Such is the case with the Democratic Party, which has essentially hijacked the word “offensive,” and now uses it to mean anything that comes out of the mouth of a conservative. Americans should be very weary whenever they see a company or an organization announce plans to combat offensive language. Entities, just like individuals, have their own political agendas, and often justify silencing the opposition by claiming to be combating “offensive speech.” Google is the latest corporation to join the fight against “offensive” speech on the Internet. Recently, the multibillion-dollar company directed its review teams to locate and flag language that could potentially be upsetting or offensive. By doing this, Google hopes to improve the overall quality of search results. (RELATED: Read about how Google took action to censor Natural News). If a member of the Google review team decides that one of the search results contains racial slurs, or that it promotes hate or violence in some way, then the content will be flagged under a new “upsetting-offensive” category. While the flagging system doesn’t delete search results completely, it does make it so that “offensive” results are buried and made more difficult to find, whereas search results that are considered to be high quality are more easily accessible. For example, an article about the role the religion of Islam plays in terror attacks may be pushed down and made more difficult to find, while an article about celebrating diversity would be a “quality” search result and found more easily. This, of course, is an extreme example, but you get the point. The review teams that are responsible for judging the quality of the search results are called “quality raters.” These people examine different websites and other content to look for things that are offensive or upsetting, such as pornography. The new feature that Google has added gives these quality raters the ability to list the “offensive content” under the new “upsetting-offensive” category. Thus far, Google has declined to comment on these changes. The “upsetting-offensive” flag reportedly instructs reviewers to “flag to all web results that contain upsetting or offensive content from the perspective of users in your locale, even if the result satisfies the user intent.” In other words, even if the results satisfy what the user was searching for, such as white supremacist websites or anti-Semitic articles, they could still potentially get flagged, even though it still wouldn’t delete the search result entirely. While an excess of propaganda and misinformation circulating the web is not something that should be encouraged, any company that seeks to regulate speech should instantly raise the red flag for supporters of the First Amendment. While it appears that right now Google is only seeking to limit the amount of extreme content out there, such as pornography and white supremacist sites, this new initiative could easily begin infringing on the free speech rights of American citizens, even if it’s speech that is not offensive or upsetting. Despite good intentions, Google may very well have started down a slippery slope. If you are uncomfortable or weary about what Google is doing, sign our petition to let them know that their actions are in violation of the First Amendment’s freedom of speech.

Skim for all the social news you need to know! 1. Has Facebook gone too far with Snapchat clone on Messenger? The cat's out of the bag: Facebook's going to try to copy every successful Snapchat feature across its own platforms. It tackled filters and augmented reality masks by acquiring MSQRD and introduced a near replica of Snacphat Stories on Instagram, and it has now launched Messenger Day—another Snapchat Stories clone—across iOS and Android devices. Zuckerberg once tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion, and it appears Snapchat's wariness triggered a rivalry in which Facebook feels the need to beat the ephemeral messaging app at its own game. But many feel that Messenger Day upended what was a great texting application by adding superfluous buttons and unused features to their home screens. Have you used Messenger Day? What are your thoughts? 2. Google takes on Slack with new communication tools for businesses Google's taking a swipe at Slack with the introduction of two new features to ease collaboration in businesses: Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. Hangouts Meet provides an easy way to share links to video conferences without invitees' having to sign up for accounts or download plugins. Hangouts Chat combines searchable, individual chat rooms based on project with threaded conversations, and it also lets bots automatically schedule meetings for your team. Even better? Both new tools are integrated with G Suite, which means all content on Google Drive can be shared effortlessly within the new tools. Hangout Meets is available to all iOS and Android users, and Chat is set to roll out over the next few weeks. 3. LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman joins Microsoft's board Following Microsoft's $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn last year, LinkedIn co-founder Hoffman is officially joining the Microsoft board of directors and will continue focusing primarily on the social network; he will also help Microsoft expand its connections in Silicon Valley. Hoffman gave a glimpse at what could be the future of LinkedIn, given its new family at Microsoft, citing how Microsoft-powered intelligent assistant Cortana could help users decide which third-degree connections on LinkedIn make the most sense to reach out to, or how Microsoft's HoloLens virtual reality gear could make LinkedIn Learning courses more immersive. The future seems bright, according to Hoffman, so stay tuned. 4. Pinterest just lost access to 1.3 billion people The People's Republic of China has found something wrong with what's potentially the least controversial social network out there: Pinterest. The Great Fire Wall, as China's Internet censorship system is referred to, has made the social network inaccessible for over one week now. Conjecture suggests the blackout might be due to the "Two Sessions" meeting of China's governing classes that's currently taking place in Beijing, but it's impossible to know for certain what's caused Pinterest—one of the last American social networks accessible in China—to be taken offline. 5. How to use Facebook Messenger Day for marketing If your company already uses Messenger to communicate with customers, we've got some top tips to showcase how it can use its newest feature—Messenger Day—to expand and optimize marketing on the platform. Though Messenger Day functions much like Snapchat Stories, there are a few peculiarities that might make Messenger Day worthwhile for your marketing team. Because Messenger is available only for individual users and not (usually company) Pages, the new feature could be used strategically to spread employee-generated content in a way that builds brand awareness and expands your client base. For now, content will be coming from employees' profiles, so while Messenger Day could also be used to share news and images, and encourage users to follow your other social profiles, efforts should be focused on driving awareness and relationship-building. Click through to Social Media Examiner for all the fresh tips and tricks! 6. Seven steps to better customer service on social media If you don't yet generate many leads via social, that doesn't mean the channel can't serve other needs, such as answering consumers' questions and providing customer service. Social platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, seem to be constantly innovating to provide companies with new and better ways to communicate with customers, so why not take advantage? Doing so effectively, however, requires some preparation. From educating customers about how to get in touch and investing in the right platforms, to humanizing your messaging and connecting your data streams to complete customer profiles, Kristin Shevis of Conversocial suggests seven key steps to owning customer service on social media. 7. The key to YouTube's six-second bumper ads YouTube might be just the place for your brand to raise awareness and generate new leads, but as time goes on the social network has reworked its ad formats in a way that might now seem foreign—or impossible—for your brand to convey its message. Thorough testing and a decidedly better consumer experience means the platform's new six-second bumper ads appear here to stay, but how can your company make the most out of such a short format without fumbling? Some might try to fit everything they've got into six short seconds, but success requires a more thoughtful approach. From breaking thing down to individual elements, to employing emotion or comedy, Andrew Wohlwend of Zefr presentsthe keys to a successful six-second ad. Get your creative juices flowing with the example ads below! 8. After overreach, Facebook and Instagram bar developers from using data for surveillance Following revelations that police gained special access to the two social networks to track protest movements for Black Lives Matter, the two social networks rewrote their privacy policy to ban developers from using the platforms' data for surveillance purposes. Police gained access via controversial developer, Geofeedia, which partnered with law enforcement to track streams of user content. The American Civil Liberties Union obtained documents proving the connection last year, and it is now pushing social networks to take a strong stance on human rights to avoid similar missteps in the future. Social media might just be the next frontier for civil liberty battles after all. 9. YouTube launches an experimental app for watching videos with friends Dubbed "Uptime," the new app from Google's YouTube aims to make video viewing a more social experience by encourage friends to watch—and react—together. In the app, users' profile photos float alongside the video (mostly vertical in format) they're currently viewing, and they can comment or react with emojis that can be seen live or after-the-fact by friends that watch the same content. Available only on iOS for now, Uptime wants to encourage a co-viewing experience for video; videos on YouTube can be searched and then shared from within the application. The app is currently invite only, but checking out Uptime's Twitter feed gets you the golden ticket via an invite code, so go give it a shot! Short video of what #Uptime is all about. ?? ??

Reddit's getting hot as it positions to counterbalance fake news—and Facebook Remarkable election and referendum results in 2016 prompted many to ask whether social media was creating an echo chamber that shielded users from opposing points of view and simply reinforced the worldview of their "friends". Reddit—280 million active users strong—thinks it can destroy that echo chamber. The social network, long a minefield for brands because of some of its users anti-advertising sentiment, lets users post links that are then simply upvoted or downvoted, leaving out the social connection factor of people choosing who to follow. The small feel of the social network is becoming an attractive place for brands, and it might just force us to be exposed to new points of views that could change the game. 11. We'll wrap up with a way to take on clickbait like you've never seen On National Read a Book Day, one bookstore in Texas took a novel approach to tricking Facebook users into reading copyright-free classics: It used a superb play on clickbait—or "Litbait," as the bookstore calls it. Users fell for clickbait-like titles of Facebook articles that were actually descriptions of literary classics, such as Romeo & Juliet. They were then redirected to the entirety of the selected copyright-free novel, online. Former #SocialSkim columnist Angela Natividad has the scoop from cover to cover in Adage, highlighting how originality on social media can serve not only a cause but also your brand: The bookstore's website had a massive traffic increase in traffic, as well as Facebook engagement.

Android O Could Feature Notification Revamp and Picture-in-Picture GO The new Android version will bring multiple changes Mar 18, 2017 15:27 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google is said to offer a first glimpse at Android O during the Google I/O conference, set to take place in May. Until then, new information about the upcoming OS version continues to surface online, the latest referring to changes regarding notifications. Apparently, Google intends to bring lots of changes to notifications in Android O, including app icon badges for notifications. This would mean that each notification would carry the app icon, and users would be able to get a quick glance at how many notifications they have for any given app simply by looking at the home screen. In addition, 9to5Google stated that Android O could come with a completely redesigned notification system, but that remains to be seen. Google might also include a picture-in-picture mode just like on Android TV. Moreover, Google might be working on a smart text selection floating toolbar with Assistant integration. The feature would automatically copy relevant information from apps and surface it when needed. The “Copy Less” feature was mentioned in an earlier report, stating that it would include integration with Google Assistant. Restricted background activities from apps and dynamically changing icons Google might also bring the restricted background activities from apps feature to Android O. The tool is currently found in Chrome 57 and it allows users to reduce power consumption of background tabs, so that battery life would be optimized. The stricter throttling tool in Chrome 57 can result in 25% less power consumption. Dynamically changing icons is another feature revealed in the report, a feature that is currently found in the Pixel Launcher for Google Pixel smartphones. Furthermore, Google may intend to bring lots of improvements to MediaRecorder API, which allows apps to capture audio and video in order to save data to persistent storage. Moreover, improvements could also be brought to enterprise features and audio latency. Take this information with a grain of salt for now, and we’ll just have to wait and see what Google has in store for Android O. When it comes to the name of the upcoming version, some have hinted towards Android Oreo, but it’s simply too early to say for sure. #Google#Android O#Notifications#Dynamic icons#Google Assistant subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Assistant Will Not Be Pushed to Android Tablets Google Introduces Family Link App with Parental Controls Google May Have a Third Smartphone in the Works Under Codename “Taimen” Google Reportedly Downgrading Nexus 6 Phones to Android 7.0 Nougat (from 7.1) Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB4015438 Also Taking Ages to Install Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Build 15063 for PC and Mobile YouTube on Restricted Mode Blocking LGBTQ+ Content: Our System Is Flawed 7 Tips to Stay Safe from Attacks like the Fappening Here’s Another Windows Phone App You Must Say Goodbye to New Instagram Update Allows Users to Save Live Videos Dutch Police Buys Unnecessary Microsoft Office Licenses by Mistake… Twice Google Releases Android 7.1.2 Nougat Beta 2 for Nexus and Pixel    Google I/O new android apps Psiphon Pro APK: Updated March 20th, 16:23 GMT Terrarium TV APK: Updated March 20th, 16:14 GMT Lyft APK: Updated March 20th, 16:10 GMT Waze APK: Updated March 20th, 16:07 GMT Assassin's Creed Pirates APK: Updated March 20th, 14:12 GMT Just Dance Now APK: Updated March 20th, 14:05 GMT Trials Frontier APK: Updated March 20th, 13:58 GMT Reader comments Samsung's Bixby AI Assistant to Arrive After Galaxy S8 Launch more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The new Connected Modular 45 timepiece uses an Intel SoC, runs Google’s Android Wear 2.0, and is listed with 'expanded functionality'. Tag Heuer will also offer a variety of customization options for the new smartwatch and aim to address different market segments with the new product. Furthermore, the watchmaker says that the Connected Modular 45 design could easily fit a mechanical module and be converted into a regular timepiece. Tag Heuer, Google and Intel formally introduced their first-gen connected smartwatch in late-2015. The wristwatch was the first device of the kind for Tag Heuer and for Intel, and so it was largely a test vehicle for both of them. As it turned out, the Tag Heuer Connected was considered a success by its developers and with the second generation they decided to install a more capable computing platform, a better display and introduce customizable design options. The use of Google Android Wear 2.0 should expand the overall functionality of the new smartwatch, in order to offer more features. Tag Heuer will offer different configurations of the Connected Modular 45: 11 standard versions available in retail and additional configurations upon request. Each timepiece consists of three key elements which users can mix and match: the watch module, the lugs, and the strap. All watch modules are made of grade 5 titanium 5 with a sand-blasted satin finish (of a chosen color), but users can choose bezels of different colors made of ceramic, gold, aluminum, titanium, and even covered with diamonds. The lugs can match the bezels and thus can be made of aluminum, titanium, ceramic and so on. Finally, the manufacturer will offer a variety of straps featuring different colors (black, brown, red, green, etc.) made of calfskin, rubber, ceramic or titanium. The central piece of the Connected Modular 45 is, of course, the watch module. The latter is based on the Intel Atom Z3400-series SoC (Merrifield, two Silvermont cores, 1 MB cache) equipped with 512 MB of LPDDR3 memory (down from 1 GB in the previous-gen model) and 4 GB of NAND flash memory. The device comes with a wireless module featuring Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and NFC as well as a host of sensors, including an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a tilt detection sensor and an ambient light sensor. In addition, the module has a water-resistant microphone and a vibration/haptics engine, but no speaker. The most notable upgrade of the new Tag Heuer smartwatch is the new 1.39” AMOLED display, with a 400×400 resolution and 287 PPI, which is higher than many competing wearable devices. The display is covered with a 2.5-mm sapphire glass, just like many Swiss-made watches. As for the battery, the manufacturer states that it has a capacity of 410 mAh and claims it can last for up to 25 hours. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 Processor Intel Atom Z3400-series 2×Silvermont PowerVR G6400 GPU RAM 512 MB LPDDR3 Storage 4GB eMMC NAND flash Display 1.39" AMOLED 400×400 resolution 287 PPI pixel density 2-point touch Display Protection 2.5-mm Sapphire Glass Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 Wi-Fi NFC GPS Sensors accelerometer gyroscope tilt detection sensor ambient light sensor Battery 410 mAh Battery life: 25 hours Charging Magnetic charging cable Water Resistance 50 meters/50 atmosphere Color Black, titanium, aluminum, gold, diamond, etc. Strap Rubber, leather, ceramic, titanium Dimensions Diameter: ≦ 45 mm Height: 13.75 mm Inputs One button, touchscreen Operating System Google Android Wear 2.0 with phone application by Tag Heuer Compatibility Google Android 4.3+ Apple iOS 9+ Price Starts at €1600/$1650 All the Connected Modular 45 watch modules are 50 meters water resistant, just like mechanical watches by Tag Heuer. Now, speaking of mechanics, when someone buys the Connected Modular 45, they can easily switch the smartwatch module with a mechanical watch module that Tag Heuer offers: a moderately-priced Swiss mechanical movement module with 3 hands (calibre 5) or an expensive COSC-certified chronograph Tourbillon Heuer 02-T. Both are also water resistant. One of the things that Tag Heuer has learnt since the launch of the original Connected smartwatch is that there is a market for premium smartwatches. As a result, the Connected Modular 45 will be available at different price points depending on their external finish. The starting price of the smartwatch is $1650/€1600/£1400, but when fully beefed up with diamonds, their price increases to around $7000. Additionally, Tag Heuer offers the so-called Deluxe Box Set that includes one Connected Modular 45 (in grade 5 titanium, with titanium lugs and brown natural leather strap) and one chronograph Heuer-02T tourbillon mechanical module for a total price of €16,650/$17,000 (ex. tax). Both electronics and mechanical modules come with a two-year warranty. Sources: Tag Heuer, Google, Intel.

POST A COMMENT 33 Comments View All Comments yeeeeman - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link Hmm, if you have money falling off your pocket you can choose this watch. But maybe there is a better way to get this kind of watch, I mean, really the exact same capabilities with less money? Here you go http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watch-phone/pp_57617... . Same display (AMOLED, 1.39 inch 400x400), bigger battery (450mAh), metal case (you don't really need titanium, you will die before this watch is destroyed), full android experience - you can install everything you like, quad core CPU (compared to two Intel Silvermont), 1GB of RAM compared to 512, 8GB of storage compared to 4GB, SIM support compared to...nothing. Shall I continue? The only thing missing on the Finow X5 plus compared to this watch is the missing Tag Heuer badge which....can be engraved easily. Reply mjeffer - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link This is aimed at people who buy luxury watches and they would have zero interest in buying that one you linked. This is for a niche market and for that market this price is right in line. Reply shabby - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link There's nothing luxurious about this watch, its a regular smartwatch with a "high end" brand stamped on it, it will drop in value as soon as you put it on your wrist... meaning its not a luxury watch at all. Reply eddman - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link "smartwatch with a "high end" brand stamped on it" ...which is the whole point. Rich people buy brands. That's the most important thing to them. Specs might be important to some extent but are secondary for them. Reply geekman1024 - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link well, this watch and that one which yeeeeman linked, might be manufactured by the same Chinese factory....if that's the case, that will be a rather sad and funny ironic. Reply BrokenCrayons - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link It's stereotypical to say wealthy people care about branding. I'd argue to the contrary. People who have wealth are more effective money managers that understand the value of things and take into account product specifications, value for the cost, brand prestige, AND (something you forgot which is most important) the usefulness of a particular purchase. These trinkets are more for the upper middle class sorts that are trying to demonstrate wealth, but are actually not exactly above the masses of working class they're trying to escape. Reply fanofanand - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link I have to disagree with this. There are some wealthy people who are concerned with specifications and performance, but "most" wealthy people cannot be bothered to research items they are purchasing. Half the time they have an assistant who will be doing the purchasing for them, and the other half just buys whatever their friends have or whatever is most expensive. Truly wealthy people don't have time to sit down for a couple hours researching each purpose. They just tell their assistant "I need a new watch, get me a new Rolex and make it a good one" or something to that effect. We all probably have our own unique experiences with the wealthy that might guide our understanding, but my personal example would be my uncle in-law. The man is worth a few hundred million dollars, and all he cares about is prestige and appearance. He only buys/drives Mercedes "because it's a Mercedes", his watch is a Rolex, the list goes on and on. He doesn't know the first thing about tech, but he knows that "Apple is the best" so whatever is Apple, he buys. That doesn't make him dumb, the man is a brain surgeon and a lung surgeon, he is a brilliant man. He just doesn't have time to research "toys" which is what stuff like this is to the wealthy. It's one more watch to add to their collection. Nothing more. Reply boozed - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link That is how luxury brands like Tag Heuer operate. In the case of its mechanical watches, they're generally lightly modified off-the-shelf movements (e.g. ETA, Sellita) surrounded by a bunch of marketing. It's not so much about the value proposition. Reply yeeeeman - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link I fully agree with what you said, just wanted to show how outrageous this offer is. Reply Murloc - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link titanium is about weight not durability.

By Oli Gamp March 18, 2017 15:07 GMT Close Record number of anti-Semitic incidents blamed on ‘mood of racism’ in UK following Brexit IBTimes UK Google is under pressure for its alleged failure to remove anti-semitic videos from its YouTube platform after hundreds of brands were pulled out of its advertising network by agency Havas. An investigation by the Times found that major companies and taxpayers were unknowingly funding extremists through advertising, with videos receiving $7.60 (£6.10) per 1,000 views of an advert. Some 200 offending videos were reportedly found on YouTube, including titles such as "Adolf Hitler vs The Jew World Order", which attempts to debunk beliefs that the Holocaust took place and whose owner described the video platform as "JewTube". Other videos, including some helmed by David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, cite stereotyped theories that Jews control the world's banks and start wars for profit. One particular video alleged that Jews killed non-Jewish children on Passover and sold their bodies to McDonalds to be used as burger meat. It gained over a million views – enough to generate around £5,600 in advertising revenue to the individual behind it. A Google representative said it allowed people to express their views freely, but would not allow videos that spread or incite hate. "Google believes in the right for people to express views that we and many others find abhorrent, but we do not tolerate hate speech," said a spokeswoman. "We have clear policies against inciting violence or hatred and we remove content that breaks our rules or is illegal when we're made aware of it." Google's policy states: "We don't permit hate speech. [It is not] acceptable to post malicious, hateful comments about a group of people solely based on their race." The tech giant says it cannot monitor every video posted to YouTube, due to the sheer quantity – between 100-300 hours of video are posted to the site every minute – and so it relies on the public to report offensive videos. Google signed a European Commission code of conduct last year, which implores them to take down items flagged as hate speech within 24 hours, but it allegedly failed to take down six videos that were reported to them by the Times within that period.

Last week, Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google's parent company, Alphabet, predicted that future wars will be fought over claims to large datasets. "Big data is so powerful that nation states will fight over how much data matters," he told the Google Cloud Next conference. Dr. Andrej Zwitter, Professor of Ethics and International Politics at the University of Groningen and founder of the International Network Observatory, a think-tank, told Radio Sputnik that big data could actually be used to prevent wars, if there was enough political will to do so. "The problem of predicting wars is not so much a problem of big data. We've been making huge advances in conflict studies since the 70s and are relatively good at predicting conflicts. We're not so good at predicting the triggers of conflicts, when exactly they happen." "But even when we can do that, for example what we learned during the genocide in Rwanda, is that it is not only about being able to predict the conflict but also the political willingness, the investment in political freedoms and development that can prevent war." © Photo: Pixabay Will Future Wars Be Waged Over Big Data?"Only once actual conflicts happen are we really willing to intervene and that is usually too late," Zwitter said. One of the key tools for the development of data is machine learning, in which computers learn to manipulate large datasets. "As a sub-field of AI, machine learning is definitely one of the elements, such as pattern recognition and object recognition, in order to make sense of the different formats that we face in big data, such as pictures, videos, text messages. So indeed, machine learning will be one of the big disruptors of big data in the future," Zwitter said. Have you heard the news? Sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed!  ...

 Why this Google engineer gave up on Silicon Valley and moved back to India Julie Bort Mar. 18, 2017, 10:00 AM 91,040 facebook linkedin twitter email print Nupur Dave Nupur Dave By all accounts, including her own, Nupur Dave had the dream life. A native of India, she had spent the past decade living in the US. She was working at Google at the perk-filled "Googleplex" headquarters in Mountain View, California, at a job she loved. And she had obtained permanent residence, her green card. She was a program manager for a part of Google called Network Content Distribution, the network tech that makes Google run faster (in geek speak: it's Google's homegrown alternative to a content distribution network like Akamai). And the opportunities for promotion were plentiful. "I got to travel all over the world, attend conferences," she told Business Insider."It was great. The team was great. It was really good job." There was just one problem. She was growing increasingly unhappy with this Silicon Valley dream life. Expensive and lonely For one thing, the cost of living was a hardship. While she was paid well, it wasn't enough to get ahead in the costly Bay Area, much less buy a house. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The idea that all Googlers are wealthy is a "myth," she told Business Insider. While a highly specialized software engineer or a high performance manager are definitely well compensated (some of them make seven figures between pay and stock), for many rank-and-file Google employees, "Google is a medium payer," she said. For instance, salaries for a technical program manager at Google range from $93,837 to $176,500, according to Glassdoor. While that's not chicken scratch, when you factor in what it costs to live in the Valley, those salaries don't go far. "I always rented," she said, and she often had a roommate, too. But money wasn't her main problem: loneliness was worse. She missed her family in India. She missed her home country. She was single. Working long hours for Google made it hard to meet someone and have a relationship, she said. And while there is social prestige in the Valley attached to being at Google, it also intimidated some men, she felt. She became very involved with the Indian Google Network. Google has a large contingent of India ex-pats (including CEO Sundar Pichai) in Mountain View, and the Indian network is one of many Google diversity groups. Henry Blodget / Business Insider "I founded the Women’s Cricket team at Google. And with the India Google network, I organized a lot of events. I had a life. I really had a lot of friends, I’m a very social person," she said. It didn't stop that nagging feeling, though. At one point, Dave tried shaking up her life by moving to the trendy city of San Francisco. Walk everywhere. Great food. Gorgeous views.  But that soon became exhausting. She wound up with a three-hour commute, getting home each night at 8:30 p.m. She hired help from TaskRabbit to do the cleaning and the chores. But her rent was higher, as were other costs, and she couldn't afford it at the level that she needed. "I was becoming sadder and sadder," she said. The exhaustion of living in San Francisco also meant less time to do her hobby, writing and photography for her recipe blog. Then, during a visit home for her cousin's wedding, she was talking with her 8-year-old nephew who asked her why she lived in America. The only answer she could think of was, "Because my job is good."  Less pay, more ... everything Was she really living for a job? Could she have both? A life near her family in India and Google?She searched for and landed a Google job in India of parallel responsibility as a Technical Program Manager for Google For Work. But it involved a big pay cut.  Allison Joyce/Getty Images She didn't decide to take it until she had a conversation with a stranger on a plane ride who happened to be a PhD from MIT in economics and a law professor. He told her the Google India job could have a big and helpful economic impact for her home country. And the salary was enough for her to buy her own house in India. It's now been seven months and she says she's way happier. "My stress levels have been reduced to one tenth what they were. I used to sleep for 5 hours a night in the U.S. In India, I sleep for 8 hours now," she says. She wrote a post about leaving America for India that went viral on LinkedIn and has since received thousands of messages from people. Her advice to other U.S. immigrants is "don’t torture yourself" but to "trust your gut." It will tell you if the U.S. is your true home, or if it "is not your destiny."  Get the latest Google stock price here.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) faq, Google Google Data Center FAQ by Data Center Knowledge  on March 16, 2017 1 comment Tweet Google is the largest, most-used search engine in the world, with a global market share that has held steady at about 90 percent since Google Search launched in 1997 as Backrub. In 2017, Google became the most valuable brand in the world, topping Apple, according to the Brand Finance Global 500 report. Google’s position is due mainly to its core business as a search engine and its ability to transform users into payers via advertising. About 32 percent of Google visitors come from the US, where the company holds 63.9 percent of the search engine market, according to statista.com. Google had 247 million unique US users in November 2015. Globally, it boasts 1.5 billion search engine users and more than 1 billion users of Gmail. Google data centers process an average of 40 million searches per second, resulting in 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year, Internet Live Stats reports. That’s up from 795.2 million searcher per year in 1999, one year after Google was launched.

In a reorganization in October 2015, Google became a subsidiary of a new company it created called Alphabet. Since then, several projects have been canceled or scaled back, including the halt of further rollout of Google Fiber. Following the reorg, however, Google has placed a lot of focus (and dedicated a lot of resources) to selling cloud services to enterprises, going head-to-head against the market giant Amazon Web Services and the second-largest player in the space, Microsoft Azure. That has meant a major expansion of Google data centers specifically to support those cloud services. At the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco in March 2017, the company’s execs revealed that it spent nearly $30 billion on data centers over the preceding three years. While the company already has what is probably the world’s largest cloud, it was not built to support enterprise cloud services. To do that, the company needs to have data centers in more locations, and that’s what it has been doing, adding new locations to support cloud services and adding cloud data center capacity wherever it makes sense in existing locations. The largest of several murals illustrator Fuchsia MacAree painted on the walls of Google’s data center in Dublin (Photo: Google) Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about Google data centers and our best stab at answering them: Where are Google Data Centers Located? Google lists eight data center locations in the U.S., one in South America, four in Europe and two in Asia. Its cloud sites, however, are expanding, and Google’s cloud map shows many points of presence worldwide. The company also has many caching sites in colocation facilities throughout the world, whose locations it does not share. This far-flung network is necessary not only to support operations than run 24/7, but to meet specific regulations (like the EU’s privacy regulations) of certain regions and to ensure business continuity in the face of risks like natural disasters. Google data centers in the Dalles, Oregon, 2006 (Photo by Craig Mitchelldyer/Getty Images) In the works as of March 2017, are Google data centers for cloud services in California, Canada, The Netherlands, Northern Virginia, São Paulo, London, Finland, Frankfurt, Mumbai, Singapore, and Sydney. Here are the data center sites listed by Google: North America: Berkeley County, South Carolina Council Bluffs, Iowa Douglas County, Georgia Jackson County, Alabama Lenoir, North Carolina Mayes County, Oklahoma Montgomery County, Tennessee The Dalles, Oregon South America Quilicura, Chile Asia Changhua County, Taiwan Singapore Europe Dublin, Ireland Eemshaven, Netherlands Hamina, Finland St Ghislain, Belgium How Big are Google Data Centers? A paper presented during the IEEE 802.3bs Task Force in May 2014 estimates the size of five of Google’s US facilities as: Pryor Creek (Mayes County), Oklahoma , 980,000 square feet Lenoir, North Carolina, 337,000 square feet The Dalles, Oregon, 200,000 square feet (before the 2016, 164,000 square foot expansion) Council Bluff, Iowa, 200,000 square feet Berkely County, South Carolina, 200,000 square feet. Many of these sites have multiple data center buildings, as Google prefers to build additional structures as sites expand rather than containing operations in a single massive building. Google itself doesn’t disclose the size of its data centers. Instead, it mentions the cost of the sites or number of employees. Sometimes, facility size slips out. For example, the announcement about the opening of The Dalles in Oregon said the initial building was 164,000 square feet. The size of subsequent expansions, however, has been kept tightly under wraps. Reports discussing Google’s new data center in Emeshaven, Netherlands, which opened December 2016, didn’t mention size. Instead, they said the company has contracted for the entire 62 Megawatt output of a nearby windfarm and ran 9,941 miles of computer cable within the facility. The data center employs 150 people. How Many Servers Does Google Have? There’s no official data on how many servers there are in Google data centers, but Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers. This number, of course, is always changing as the company expands capacity and refreshes its hardware.   1 | 2 | 3 Previous Article Google Opens a New Front in Cloud Price Wars Next Article Everything You Wanted to Know about Google Data Centers Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

A Google spokesperson told The Star Tribune on Friday that the company will go to court, if necessary, to fight the warrant, which was issued by Hennepin County District Judge Gary Larson in early February. Read more Google’s message app Allo overshares data with friends “We will continue to object to this overreaching request for user data, and if needed, will fight it in court. We always push back when we receive excessively broad requests for data about our users,” the Google representative said. The warrant would let police demand information on anyone in the entire city of Edina who searched the victim’s name between December 1, 2016 and January 7, 2017. The information Google would be forced to provide includes, but is not limited to, contact information, date of birth, social security numbers, account and payment information, and IP (internet protocol) and MAC (media access control) addresses. On January 7, 2017, two SPIRE Credit Union account holders reported that $28,500 had been stolen from a line of credit associated with one of their accounts, according to court documents. The Edina Police Department determined that the suspect had provided the credit union with the account holder’s name, date of birth, and social security number, and also faxed a copy of a forged US passport that looked similar to that of the account holder. Police believe the suspect used Google to acquire the image, as investigators did not find the photo in searches conducted using other search engines. The warrant notes that Google had rejected an administrative subpoena that sought subscriber information on anyone who had searched the victim’s name. A public records researcher named Tony Webster first unearthed details about the warrant, whose breadth has prompted serious concerns among privacy law experts. Google confirmed to the Star Tribune they objected to the Edina search warrant, will fight in court if necessary. https://t.co/tfz358D0YHpic.twitter.com/p2iGdXs2Em— Tony Webster (@webster) March 18, 2017 Holy shit.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile There’s a mysterious new Google phone in the works and it isn’t the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL Image Source: Marques Brownlee, YouTube Zach Epstein @zacharye March 16th, 2017 at 11:25 AM Share Tweet Get ready, Android fans, because it looks like Google is going all-in on its emerging phone business. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones might not have been the best-selling Android handsets of 2016, but there’s precious little question that they were among the best and most desirable new handsets of the year. In fact, they’re still the best new Android phones you can buy right now, and that will continue to be the case until the LG G6, Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ all launch next month. Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL actually would have sold far better than they have so far if not for manufacturing issues that have left Google and its ODM partner HTC completely unable to keep up with demand. Android fans love the idea of getting premium smartphones directly from Google that will always run the latest available version of Android. Of course, Google is planning to follow up its Pixel and Pixel XL with two second-generation models later this year, and the company recently confirmed as much. Interestingly, however, it looks like there’s a third new Google smartphone in the works and it may have just been uncovered for the first time. Don't Miss: Warning: Dangerous new Gmail phishing attack can easily steal your Google login Google and Android news blog Droid Life has learned from multiple unnamed sources that Google is working on not two but three new smartphones right now. The first two are the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, which are known internally at Google as the “muskie” and “walleye.” Android fans will recall that Google’s internal hardware codenames tend to be sea creatures — the original Pixel and Pixel XL were known internally as “sailfish” and “marlin.” Next-generation Pixel codenames are good to know, but we’ve known about the muskie and walleye for a while now. The interesting part of the blog’s report is the existence of a third new smartphone that is said to be codenamed “taimen.” The blog’s sources insist that the codename refers to a new smartphone that is in development at Google, and the device apparently might not fall into the Pixel family. The only other detail worth noting in the report is that the taimen is said to be a very large device — which makes sense when you consider that taimen are very large fish in the salmon family — and that it may be even larger than the Pixel 2 XL. How big is it? What are the phone’s key features? When will it be released? The answers to these questions and more remain a mystery, but hopefully not for long now that the phone’s existence has been revealed.

As environmental issues take the center stage, alternative clean energy sources such as solar energy are gaining traction. And Google isn't one to pass off a promising opportunity. Having started the project in August 2015, Google sees this avenue as providing it with the leeway to leverage its expansive data in mapping and computing resources to help calculate the best solar plan for consumers. Founded by Google engineer Carl Elkin, the project's stated purpose is "mapping the planet's solar potential, one roof at a time." Solar Potential Joel Conkling, the product manager overseeing Google's solar initiative, outlined the insights the company gained through the analysis of 60 million buildings nationwide in a March 1 blog post. These were the findings in nutshell: 79 percent of all rooftops assessed were technically viable or had an unshaded area for setting up solar panels. The viability percentage varies between states, with Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico having the highest viability of over 90 percent. However, states like Pennsylvania, Maine and Minnesota have just above 60 percent viability. Among cities, Houston, Texas ranked high in solar potential, with an estimated 18,940 gigawatt-hours of solar generation potential per year. The other cities which follow Houston included Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Antonio and New York. Based on the EIA estimate of an average power requirement of 10,812 kilowatt-hours per year for an average U.S. home, Google said if the top 10 cities in terms of solar potential attain their full potential, the power generated would power 8 million homes across the U.S. Conkling's blog also outlined the usage of data explorer tools for consumers to deduce rooftop solar potential across U.S. zip codes, cities, counties and states. And for those looking to calculate solar and financial savings potential, Google launched the Project Sunroof savings estimator tool in 2015. Using a single sample address in Massachusetts, Google estimated that the building has 1,479 hours of usable sunlight per year (arrived at by day-to-day analysis of weather patterns) and 497 square feet available for solar models (based on 3-D modelling of roof and nearby areas). The company estimates net savings of $18,000 for the household over 20 years. Consumer Solar An Attractive Opportunity Estimates by the Solar Energy Industry Association show that the U.S. installed 14,800 megawatts of solar PV in 2016, with the total installed capacity now at 42.4 gigawatts — enough to power 8.3 million homes. The association estimates the industry will nearly triple over the next five years. GTM Research expects the residential segment to rise 9 percent year-over-year in 2017. This follows a 19 percent increase in 2016, which saw a slowdown from the scorching pace in 2015, which benefited from the emergence of several new state markets. Source: GTM Research / SEIA U.S. Solar Market Insight report California, which accounts for about half of the U.S. residential market, is projected to see a decline, while the rest of the 36 states are projected to have year-over-year growth. Data from Energy Sage lists SolarCity Corp, which is now part of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Vivint Solar Inc (NYSE: VSLR) among companies that are significant players in the residential solar energy space. With Google's consumer solar drive, the residential market could see a renewed thrust. Growth could pick up from the lackluster rate seen now, as more and more people warm to this technology and other factors driving growth, such as government support and financing.

We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network,” he promised Read more Extremists make money off taxpayer funded YouTube ads The pledge comes after several prominent advertisers announced that they would suspend online advertising with Google because of the risk that their ads could appear alongside inappropriate content. The biggest is Havas of France, the world’s sixth largest marketing services group, which said Google had been “unable to provide specific reassurances, policy and guarantees that their video or display content is classified either quickly enough or with the correct filters.” The BBC, the Guardian, and Transport for London took similar steps. The pullout comes after an expose in the Times revealed that Google had displayed the ads on some extremist sites, as well as alongside extremist videos posted on YouTube, the tech giant’s video service. The British government has summoned Google executives to explain why taxpayer money ended up funding publishers of inappropriate content via the ads. In his blog post, Harris argued that Google’s automated algorithms fail to prevent such incidents only in rare cases.

We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more.” Britain is not the only nation where tech giants face criticism for inadequately policing their content. Germany announced plans this week to pass a law that would require social networks to publish quarterly accountability reports on how they are fighting hate speech and fake news. Companies could also be fined up to €50 million ($53 million) for failing to remove inappropriate content within 24 hours after a complaint has been filed.

By: Trends Desk | Kolkata | Updated: March 18, 2017 6:47 pm The six-second clip was shared on Google India’s Twitter page and people instantly fell in love with the ode. (Source: Google India/ Twitter) Prabhas Uppalapati and Rana Daggubati-starrer ‘Baahubali: The Conclusion’ is certainly one of the most anticipated releases of 2017. And, the buzz around its trailer release has only made it stronger. Keeping fans on their toes to find out the most asked question, “Why Kattappa killed Baahubali”, the movie has left the nation’s curiosity levels racing ahead. ALSO READ | ‘Build, don’t destroy’: Amul’s take on Padmavati set being torched is what we need to remember It would be an understatement to say that the trailer of Baahubali 2 took the Internet by storm, that too, despite being leaked online just hours before its official release. Out in four languages — Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Hindi — it got a rousing reception from the fans on the Internet. All the versions of the trailer combined, crossed around 50 million views on YouTube and Facebook, in just 24 hours of its release. The record spoke for itself indicating the amount of interest that the film has managed to generate among the moviegoers, not just in India but all across the globe.

The tech giant shared the animated clip inspired by the film featuring Prabhas and wrote, “The mind of a genius met the heart of a warrior. It was always going to be a colourful encounter.” The clip included all the top trends for the week from Baahubali to Holi, and as the trend shifts from one trend to another, Prabhas, who plays Amarendra Baahubali gets cool makeovers corresponding to the trends. From the fierce warrior look to the nerdy look resembling that of Albert Einstein and ending it with a splash of colours, the clip is just superb. And Twitterati could not agree more. The mind of a genius met the heart of a warrior.

The $130 Google device answers questions, controls your smart home, and plays music. Should you buy one? Read More )? It’s just convenient! Today, we’re going to dig into the Xiaomi Yeelight Smart Light Strip. It’s a 2-meter (6.56-ft) strip of LEDs that connect to your home Wi-Fi to let you control them from your phone, or remotely. Obviously, the first name that comes to mind in connected lighting is the Phillips Hue, and in the case of smart strip LEDs, the Hue goes for around $90 (and needs a hub). There’s also the LIFX Z starter kit that sells for the same price. The Xiaomi Yeelight is available from GearBest for just $30! Courtesy of GearBest, we’ve got a strip to give away to one lucky reader – read on to find out how to win. Initial Impressions The first thing you’ll notice when you get your Yeelight Smart Light Strip is that nothing about it feels cheap. It comes in a very Apple-like white box that makes it feel much more expensive than it actually is. Once you crack it open, you’re greeted by the flexible lighting strip, with the power lead and remote tucked underneath. The power cable is quite long, coming in at 3 meters (9.8ft), while the strip itself measures 2 meters. The single-button remote sits on the cable. You hit the button quickly to turn the light on and off, and you hold it down to change the color. Of course, you’re buying a smart light strip, which means you’ll probably be using the Internet features to work with the light more often than not. Still, having the remote is nice for situations where your Internet is down, or you just don’t feel like pulling your phone out. The Lights Quickly, before we jump into all the internet features of the Yeelight, let’s just take a moment to look at the actual lights themselves. First, they have support for 16 million colors with RGB LEDs, so you can definitely tweak them to support whatever mood you’re trying to achieve. There’s no separate white LEDs though. The lights are also quite bright, coming in at 140 lumens. At full brightness, these will light up an area quite well. If you’re using them under cabinets to light up your counter, for example, they’ll keep everything well-accented. The strip itself is flexible, so you can safely bend it to get around corners or to cast focus on something round. It also has specific spots on the strip so you can cut it if you don’t need to full length for the DIY project 5 DIY Home Automation Projects to Get Started With Your Smart Home 5 DIY Home Automation Projects to Get Started With Your Smart Home When it comes to creating smart homes, most people just don't know where to start.

Speaking of which, it comes with an adhesive backing so you an easily stick it to just about whatever you want. Depending on the situation, you can also get more creative with how you mount it, but for most people, the adhesive backing will get the lights up and rolling. They’re also somewhat rugged, coming with an IP-65 rating thanks to the rubberised coating that covers any electrical contacts. This means they’re highly resistant to water hitting the surface of the light (but not fully submersible), and completely dust-tight. Connected Features The real key to the Xiaomi Yeelight Smart Light Strip is the fact that it connects to the internet. Once you plug the light in, you need to download the Yeelight app and follow the process. It all worked on the first try, and was easy to get up and running. The app does make you choose a server location, and the only options are Singapore and China mainland. I’m in the US, but it worked fine with the Singapore server. The app itself does what you’d expect — you can turn the lights on and off, change the color, and adjust the brightness. The basic functions you’d expect from a light are certainly all there. You can also set them to run on a schedule. You can tell them to turn off and on automatically at a specific time, or you can turn on the sleep timer to have the lights go off after a certain amount of time. Another cool function within the app is the ability to create preset scenes. They’re easy to make, and it’ll allow you to jump between multiple presets without needing to manually drag the colors around. Obviously, this feature is much more useful if you have multiple Yeelights, as you can set scenes to make them all work together in unison – but it’s also required if you want to use IFTTT IFTTT Applets Are Finally Here: What You Need to Know IFTTT Applets Are Finally Here: What You Need to Know Now, you can connect multiple apps with IFTTT applets. Find out all you need to know about them and enhance your productivity. Read More with your lights (and trust me, you do). The Favorite option in the app lets you choose from a number of recommended looks (or create your own). For example, you can choose sunrise to have the light ease into a bright yellow light over 15 minutes. You can choose sunset to go the opposite way over 10 minutes, as well. These preset scenes offer a fun way to enhance the mood in any room. Third-Party Features Right out of the box, the lights have Alexa certification, which means they have full support to work with Echo for voice control. I don’t own an Echo, but based on user reviews, it does seem to work quite well. Where I really put the Yeelight through its paces is with IFTTT support. You open up all kinds of possibilities with it. I set it up to work with Google Home through it, and it worked perfectly. I set the command to, “Hey Google, turn on/off the strip light,” and it did just that. You could also set commends to change colors. For me, I set the commend, “Hey Google, make the sun go down” to cause the light to go to sunset mode. You can get creative with setting the commands however you want. Another cool use I found for IFTTT was setting the lights to turn on when I arrived home. If you attach the lights along your stairs, and use this command, you can make sure you can see where you’re going! Here are just a few other ideas for IFTTT and the Yeelight strip: Turn blue when you get a Facebook notification Turn light to favorite team’s color when their game starts Change scene when temperature outside drops below a certain point Link smart home devices to work together Those are just a few off the top of my head, but you get the idea. You can certainly get creative, and depending where you put the lights, you can do some pretty cool stuff with them. All in all, I’m impressed by the connected features offered here. Between the built-in features and IFTTT, I really can’t think of anything the lights should handle, but don’t.

Monaghan Before the invention of the computer, most experimental psychologists thought the brain was an unknowable black box. You could analyze a subject’s behavior—ring bell, dog salivates—but thoughts, memories, emotions? That stuff was obscure and inscrutable, beyond the reach of science. So these behaviorists, as they called themselves, confined their work to the study of stimulus and response, feedback and reinforcement, bells and saliva. They gave up trying to understand the inner workings of the mind. They ruled their field for four decades. Then, in the mid-1950s, a group of rebellious psychologists, linguists, information theorists, and early artificial-intelligence researchers came up with a different conception of the mind. People, they argued, were not just collections of conditioned responses. They absorbed information, processed it, and then acted upon it. They had systems for writing, storing, and recalling memories. They operated via a logical, formal syntax. The brain wasn’t a black box at all. It was more like a computer. June 2016. Subscribe now. The so-called cognitive revolution started small, but as computers became standard equipment in psychology labs across the country, it gained broader acceptance. By the late 1970s, cognitive psychology had overthrown behaviorism, and with the new regime came a whole new language for talking about mental life. Psychologists began describing thoughts as programs, ordinary people talked about storing facts away in their memory banks, and business gurus fretted about the limits of mental bandwidth and processing power in the modern workplace. This story has repeated itself again and again. As the digital revolution wormed its way into every part of our lives, it also seeped into our language and our deep, basic theories about how things work. Technology always does this. During the Enlightenment, Newton and Descartes inspired people to think of the universe as an elaborate clock. In the industrial age, it was a machine with pistons. (Freud’s idea of psychodynamics borrowed from the thermodynamics of steam engines.) Now it’s a computer. Which is, when you think about it, a fundamentally empowering idea. Because if the world is a computer, then the world can be coded. Code is logical. Code is hackable. Code is destiny. These are the central tenets (and self-fulfilling prophecies) of life in the digital age. As software has eaten the world, to paraphrase venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, we have surrounded ourselves with machines that convert our actions, thoughts, and emotions into data—raw material for armies of code-wielding engineers to manipulate. We have come to see life itself as something ruled by a series of instructions that can be discovered, exploited, optimized, maybe even rewritten. Companies use code to understand our most intimate ties; Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has gone so far as to suggest there might be a “fundamental mathematical law underlying human relationships that governs the balance of who and what we all care about.” In 2013, Craig Venter announced that, a decade after the decoding of the human genome, he had begun to write code that would allow him to create synthetic organisms. “It is becoming clear,” he said, “that all living cells that we know of on this planet are DNA-software-driven biological machines.” Even self-help literature insists that you can hack your own source code, reprogramming your love life, your sleep routine, and your spending habits.

Watch Him Do the Same With AI. In this world, the ability to write code has become not just a desirable skill but a language that grants insider status to those who speak it. They have access to what in a more mechanical age would have been called the levers of power. “If you control the code, you control the world,” wrote futurist Marc Goodman. (In Bloomberg Businessweek, Paul Ford was slightly more circumspect: “If coders don’t run the world, they run the things that run the world.” Tomato, tomahto.) But whether you like this state of affairs or hate it—whether you’re a member of the coding elite or someone who barely feels competent to futz with the settings on your phone—don’t get used to it. Our machines are starting to speak a different language now, one that even the best coders can’t fully understand. Over the past several years, the biggest tech companies in Silicon Valley have aggressively pursued an approach to computing called machine learning. In traditional programming, an engineer writes explicit, step-by-step instructions for the computer to follow. With machine learning, programmers don’t encode computers with instructions. They train them. If you want to teach a neural network to recognize a cat, for instance, you don’t tell it to look for whiskers, ears, fur, and eyes. You simply show it thousands and thousands of photos of cats, and eventually it works things out. If it keeps misclassifying foxes as cats, you don’t rewrite the code. You just keep coaching it. This approach is not new—it’s been around for decades—but it has recently become immensely more powerful, thanks in part to the rise of deep neural networks, massively distributed computational systems that mimic the multilayered connections of neurons in the brain. And already, whether you realize it or not, machine learning powers large swaths of our online activity. Facebook uses it to determine which stories show up in your News Feed, and Google Photos uses it to identify faces. Machine learning runs Microsoft’s Skype Translator, which converts speech to different languages in real time. Self-driving cars use machine learning to avoid accidents. Even Google’s search engine—for so many years a towering edifice of human-written rules—has begun to rely on these deep neural networks. In February the company replaced its longtime head of search with machine-learning expert John Giannandrea, and it has initiated a major program to retrain its engineers in these new techniques. “By building learning systems,” Giannandrea told reporters this fall, “we don’t have to write these rules anymore.” Our machines speak a different language now, one that even the best coders can’t fully understand. But here’s the thing: With machine learning, the engineer never knows precisely how the computer accomplishes its tasks. The neural network’s operations are largely opaque and inscrutable. It is, in other words, a black box. And as these black boxes assume responsibility for more and more of our daily digital tasks, they are not only going to change our relationship to technology—they are going to change how we think about ourselves, our world, and our place within it. If in the old view programmers were like gods, authoring the laws that govern computer systems, now they’re like parents or dog trainers. And as any parent or dog owner can tell you, that is a much more mysterious relationship to find yourself in. Andy Rubin is an inveterate tinkerer and coder. The cocreator of the Android operating system, Rubin is notorious in Silicon Valley for filling his workplaces and home with robots. He programs them himself. “I got into computer science when I was very young, and I loved it because I could disappear in the world of the computer. It was a clean slate, a blank canvas, and I could create something from scratch,” he says. “It gave me full control of a world that I played in for many, many years.” Now, he says, that world is coming to an end. Rubin is excited about the rise of machine learning—his new company, Playground Global, invests in machine-learning startups and is positioning itself to lead the spread of intelligent devices—but it saddens him a little too. Because machine learning changes what it means to be an engineer. “People don’t linearly write the programs,” Rubin says. “After a neural network learns how to do speech recognition, a programmer can’t go in and look at it and see how that happened. It’s just like your brain. You can’t cut your head off and see what you’re thinking.” When engineers do peer into a deep neural network, what they see is an ocean of math: a massive, multilayer set of calculus problems that—by constantly deriving the relationship between billions of data points—generate guesses about the world. Artificial intelligence wasn’t supposed to work this way. Until a few years ago, mainstream AI researchers assumed that to create intelligence, we just had to imbue a machine with the right logic. Write enough rules and eventually we’d create a system sophisticated enough to understand the world. They largely ignored, even vilified, early proponents of machine learning, who argued in favor of plying machines with data until they reached their own conclusions. For years computers weren’t powerful enough to really prove the merits of either approach, so the argument became a philosophical one. “Most of these debates were based on fixed beliefs about how the world had to be organized and how the brain worked,” says Sebastian Thrun, the former Stanford AI professor who created Google’s self-driving car. “Neural nets had no symbols or rules, just numbers. That alienated a lot of people.” The implications of an unparsable machine language aren’t just philosophical. For the past two decades, learning to code has been one of the surest routes to reliable employment—a fact not lost on all those parents enrolling their kids in after-school code academies. But a world run by neurally networked deep-learning machines requires a different workforce. Analysts have already started worrying about the impact of AI on the job market, as machines render old skills irrelevant. Programmers might soon get a taste of what that feels like themselves. Just as Newtonian physics wasn’t obviated by quantum mechanics, code will remain a powerful tool set to explore the world. “I was just having a conversation about that this morning,” says tech guru Tim O’Reilly when I ask him about this shift. “I was pointing out how different programming jobs would be by the time all these STEM-educated kids grow up.” Traditional coding won’t disappear completely—indeed, O’Reilly predicts that we’ll still need coders for a long time yet—but there will likely be less of it, and it will become a meta skill, a way of creating what Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, calls the “scaffolding” within which machine learning can operate. Just as Newtonian physics wasn’t obviated by the discovery of quantum mechanics, code will remain a powerful, if incomplete, tool set to explore the world. But when it comes to powering specific functions, machine learning will do the bulk of the work for us. Of course, humans still have to train these systems. But for now, at least, that’s a rarefied skill. The job requires both a high-level grasp of mathematics and an intuition for pedagogical give-and-take. “It’s almost like an art form to get the best out of these systems,” says Demis Hassabis, who leads Google’s DeepMind AI team. “There’s only a few hundred people in the world that can do that really well.” But even that tiny number has been enough to transform the tech industry in just a couple of years. Whatever the professional implications of this shift, the cultural consequences will be even bigger. If the rise of human-written software led to the cult of the engineer, and to the notion that human experience can ultimately be reduced to a series of comprehensible instructions, machine learning kicks the pendulum in the opposite direction. The code that runs the universe may defy human analysis. Right now Google, for example, is facing an antitrust investigation in Europe that accuses the company of exerting undue influence over its search results. Such a charge will be difficult to prove when even the company’s own engineers can’t say exactly how its search algorithms work in the first place. This explosion of indeterminacy has been a long time coming. It’s not news that even simple algorithms can create unpredictable emergent behavior—an insight that goes back to chaos theory and random number generators. Over the past few years, as networks have grown more intertwined and their functions more complex, code has come to seem more like an alien force, the ghosts in the machine ever more elusive and ungovernable. Planes grounded for no reason. Seemingly unpreventable flash crashes in the stock market. Rolling blackouts. These forces have led technologist Danny Hillis to declare the end of the age of Enlightenment, our centuries-long faith in logic, determinism, and control over nature. Hillis says we’re shifting to what he calls the age of Entanglement. “As our technological and institutional creations have become more complex, our relationship to them has changed,” he wrote in the Journal of Design and Science. “Instead of being masters of our creations, we have learned to bargain with them, cajoling and guiding them in the general direction of our goals. We have built our own jungle, and it has a life of its own.” The rise of machine learning is the latest—and perhaps the last—step in this journey. This can all be pretty frightening. After all, coding was at least the kind of thing that a regular person could imagine picking up at a boot camp. Coders were at least human. Now the technological elite is even smaller, and their command over their creations has waned and become indirect. Already the companies that build this stuff find it behaving in ways that are hard to govern. Last summer, Google rushed to apologize when its photo recognition engine started tagging images of black people as gorillas. The company’s blunt first fix was to keep the system from labeling anything as a gorilla. To nerds of a certain bent, this all suggests a coming era in which we forfeit authority over our machines. “One can imagine such technology outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand,” wrote Stephen Hawking—sentiments echoed by Elon Musk and Bill Gates, among others. “Whereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all.” But don’t be too scared; this isn’t the dawn of Skynet. We’re just learning the rules of engagement with a new technology. Already, engineers are working out ways to visualize what’s going on under the hood of a deep-learning system. But even if we never fully understand how these new machines think, that doesn’t mean we’ll be powerless before them. In the future, we won’t concern ourselves as much with the underlying sources of their behavior; we’ll learn to focus on the behavior itself. The code will become less important than the data we use to train it. This isn’t the dawn of Skynet. We’re just learning the rules of engagement with a new technology. If all this seems a little familiar, that’s because it looks a lot like good old 20th-century behaviorism. In fact, the process of training a machine-learning algorithm is often compared to the great behaviorist experiments of the early 1900s. Pavlov triggered his dog’s salivation not through a deep understanding of hunger but simply by repeating a sequence of events over and over. He provided data, again and again, until the code rewrote itself. And say what you will about the behaviorists, they did know how to control their subjects. In the long run, Thrun says, machine learning will have a democratizing influence. In the same way that you don’t need to know HTML to build a website these days, you eventually won’t need a PhD to tap into the insane power of deep learning. Programming won’t be the sole domain of trained coders who have learned a series of arcane languages. It’ll be accessible to anyone who has ever taught a dog to roll over. “For me, it’s the coolest thing ever in programming,” Thrun says, “because now anyone can program.” For much of computing history, we have taken an inside-out view of how machines work. First we write the code, then the machine expresses it. This worldview implied plasticity, but it also suggested a kind of rules-based determinism, a sense that things are the product of their underlying instructions. Machine learning suggests the opposite, an outside-in view in which code doesn’t just determine behavior, behavior also determines code. Machines are products of the world. Ultimately we will come to appreciate both the power of handwritten linear code and the power of machine-learning algorithms to adjust it—the give-and-take of design and emergence. It’s possible that biologists have already started figuring this out. Gene-editing techniques like Crispr give them the kind of code-manipulating power that traditional software programmers have wielded. But discoveries in the field of epigenetics suggest that genetic material is not in fact an immutable set of instructions but rather a dynamic set of switches that adjusts depending on the environment and experiences of its host. Our code does not exist separate from the physical world; it is deeply influenced and transmogrified by it. Venter may believe cells are DNA-software-driven machines, but epigeneticist Steve Cole suggests a different formulation: “A cell is a machine for turning experience into biology.” And now, 80 years after Alan Turing first sketched his designs for a problem-solving machine, computers are becoming devices for turning experience into technology. For decades we have sought the secret code that could explain and, with some adjustments, optimize our experience of the world. But our machines won’t work that way for much longer—and our world never really did. We’re about to have a more complicated but ultimately more rewarding relationship with technology. We will go from commanding our devices to parenting them. Editor at large Jason Tanz (@jasontanz) wrote about Andy Rubin’s new company, Playground, in issue 24.03.

Kumar Avinash Bhat March 18, 2017 17:40 IST Updated: March 20, 2017 01:05 IST more-in From the Field Website hits (visits) jumped to half a million last December, when fake stories around demonetisation started to circulate. In January, a report by a news agency claiming that the United Arab Emirates had attached assets of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim went viral after it was picked up by members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and shared on social media. Subsequently, the Ambassador of the UAE in India dismissed the reports saying that he did not know of any such raids. The immediacy of social media and instant messaging platforms such as WhatsApp make it tempting to share information to a wider audience with a simple swipe on a smart phone. In this age of post-truth and alternative facts, users are susceptible to nuggets of information that tap into a wide range of emotions from outrage to pride, anger to patriotism. The necessary service of fact-checking or verification of social media posts is yet to pick up in India, but it is becoming vital in a country that crossed 346.22 million mobile internet users in September last year (a report by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India). Internationally, Snopes.com has a section dealing with India-based forwards and posts, but the reach of Snopes is limited in a country that loves its forwards and accepts their claims with touching trust. There are a handful of fact-checking websites in the country, but they are more focused on verifying political news and government data. This leaves a wide gap for the other kinds of forwards that people receive and share on a minute to minute basis. The boy/ girl missing, blood needed, the ten rupee coin banned kind of forwards tend to spread like wildfire. Most people do not have the time and resources or even see the need to verify these messages before sharing them. Finally, a handful of websites are beginning to find ways to bust these forwards. In 2015, Shammas Oliyath was one among thousands of people who received a forward about a child admitted to KIMS Hospital in Bengaluru needing assistance. It led to chaos even in the hospital, with authorities wondering which ward the child was in. “It was revealed much later that the child was in Mumbai,” says Oliyath. This bothered the software engineer enough to talk to friend Bala Krishn Birla and eventually start a Wordpress blog listing out such spam messages. Then, last August, the duo launched Check4Spam.com, a myth-busting website. “We got our own domain and started a Whatsapp number to collect spam messages from people, so that we could research them and label them as true or false,” says Birla, an engineering graduate from IIT Kanpur. The two friends analyse social media messages and forwards besides holding full-time day jobs. Tricky research Finding out if a forwarded message is factually correct is not an easy task. Many people simply delete outlandish messages. However, for many, a cry for help or a carefully worded message that endorses (or counters) their ideological views is hard to ignore. Fake messages can range from the seemingly innocent, like a change in Indian Railway’s ticket booking system, to the bizarre like leftover onions being poisonous. “Then, there are the UNESCO forwards. According to these, the UNESCO selects everything Indian to be the best in the world,” said Shreyas K, an advertising professional who works in Bengaluru. “Most spam messages can be verified based on online research. I usually spend three hours once I reach home after work researching the submissions we receive from site visitors. However, for the smartly created ones, it takes much longer and involves calling the numbers listed in the message as well,” Oliyath explained. This is not as simple as it may seem. Sometimes two or more photos sourced from unrelated places are morphed to create a single image. “A simple reverse image search on Google does not work in such cases,” said Oliyath. Then, the duo has to separate each image and submit it for a reverse search individually. “Now imagine if it is a collage,” he said, smiling. According to Birla, spam can be broadly categorised into text, text plus image, and image files. They can be classified as ideological, finance-based and no-good-for-anything type messages. The last would include something inane like a woman giving birth to 11 babies. “In this case,” said Birla, “we found that the woman was a South American and the 11 infants were from an IVF clinic in Gujarat!” Rapid grapevine A big problem that verifiers face is the incredible speed with which a spam message is spread. “A forward that has been shared thousands of times will be all over Google. Often, the first results when we start verifying will be of websites containing the same news. Most of the time, these websites are just looking to attract visitors and don’t bother to verify the content individually,” said T. Arvind, a search engine optimisation, or SEO, expert. This becomes a time-consuming barrier for those looking to trace the source. “We often find answers only after the first five-ten pages of Google search. With morphed images, the real images tend to get pushed down in the search results and will appear only after ten pages,” explained Oliyath. Some fake news forwards go viral so quickly that damage control is the only option. A case in point was a Valentine’s Day notice purportedly issued by the management of a popular Bengaluru college, which stated that it was mandatory for female students to have at least one boyfriend by February 14. As the fake notice went viral, the college was prompted to issue a statement that the information was false. Globally, both Google and Facebook have announced several measures to weed out users and websites that carry fake news. Last month, Google announced a tie-up with French news agencies to verify news, photos and even memes about the French Presidential elections. These efforts are yet to reach India. 150 a day and growing As probably the first website dedicated to checking spam and fake forwards in the country, Oliyath and Birla are on a tough journey. “I am usually up till 1 a.m. doing research. When we get verification requests for spam we have already dealt with, I spend 30-45 minutes during my lunch break to respond with the relevant links. We get around 150 requests in a day and most of these forwards have already been dealt with on our website,” said Oliyath. Oliyath handles the research and Birla handles the technology. “I spend two-three hours a day on the site. We struggle when traffic increases. Some days when there is a strong rumour doing the rounds, we have more than 1,000 users on the site. A case in point is when there was a message about electronic registration of property,” said Birla. To help maintain the website, the duo has opted for Google’s advertising platform. “This helps us break even on the cost of maintaining the website. While we are not looking to make a profit from the site, we certainly do want to grow. A browser plugin or making the API available to other developers are some of the things we are looking at,” he said. With 80% of all requests received by Check4Spam falling firmly in the rumour/ spam category, the work can get a little overwhelming at times. “We are now looking for volunteers to help with the fact-checking. Many people do fact-check for their own satisfaction or for telling their friends. If they send us their research debunking a myth, we will scrutinise the method and if satisfied, post it on our website” said Oliyath. Scaling up The website has received close to 2,250 requests for verification since October last year. An average of 120 requests a day is the norm, with the site seeing around a quarter million hits per month on average. Hits went up to half a million in December 2016, when several rumours based on demonetisation started circulating. They are looking at adding a ‘partly true’ section, which is also found in some international fact-checking websites. Eventually, Check4Spam wants to scale up by collaborating with other like-minded teams from across the country. While reaching the level of a Snopes.com will take a few years, the founders say they have the patience to play the long game. “There are teams in Hyderabad and other cities. I plan to reach out to them so that we could all work together and avoid duplication.” For now, the website is committed to staying non-commercial. “We won’t consider funding unless the source matches our commitment to weeding out fake news,” said Oliyath. Corrections & Clarifications: Editing error - The strapline of the report said, “verification request jumped to half a million last December, when fake stories around demonetisation started to circulate.” It is actually, Website hits jumped to half a million… Post a Comment More In Internet human interest science and technology internet Related Articles << Previous Story Kremlin, on U.S. Yahoo hack charges, says its spies not involved Next Story >> Please Wait while comments are loading...

Google Drive Websites Host For Free Rochester Business Journal March 15, 2017 We all know google drive offer free web hosting,  However, Google has now decided to pull the plug on the tool due to increased competition. The company revealed that users have better options available to them now, given the fact that several web content hosting tools and services already exist compared to the time Google launched the tool. Because of this, Google is now looking to discontinue offering the said tool and will instead channel its energy on the core Drive and Google apps experience. While it can be argued that Google could have made the web hosting tool a paid service and incorporated additional features to make it commercially viable and appealing, it seems the company is happier taking the exit route, here is a quick and easy to read google web hosting reviews . However, with a year to go before the Google Drive web hosting tool becomes defunct, one can still deploy it to host sites that require only basic HTML. The tool also has API support for developers. Those who are currently making use of Drive's free web hosting service can look at shifting to other services . Alternatively, Google Domains will also be able to refer users of Drive to third-party sites that offer website hosting services. What You're Saying  There are no comments yet.

But, we’re inside the window where it’s time for Android O rumors to take off and that yearly tradition is starting off with a few interesting features. We’ve already seen a teaser about the potential Oreo name, but to be fair on that Hiroshi Lockheimer is not the most reliable source.  Unfortunately, we can’t be too sure about the source of these rumors either. The unnamed source for 9to5Google appears to have insider knowledge and the outlet has gotten scoops before, so we’ll have to see. The details of the rumors are also a bit lacking. Supposedly, there are a number of new features planned, including: Changes to notifications App icon badges for notifications Picture-in-picture mode Smart text selection toolbar with Assistant integration Restricted background app activity Adaptive icons MediaRecorder API improvements A “ton” of features focused on enterprise Some of these are pretty easy to guess what they mean: app icon badges are something we’ve seen on iOS since the beginning, although they are quite divisive (I, like other inbox-zero types, hate them). Picture-in-picture mode sounds like a floating window and is a feature already available on Android TV. Restricted background app activity is also self-explanatory and likely related to battery life optimization. The smart text selection sounds like a more targeted version of the already available Screen Search feature of Assistant. And, adaptive icons could well mean dynamic icons so weather apps or calendar apps can be more relevant at a glance.  However, the other features are quite vague, so we’re not going to speculate too much. Instead, we’ll leave it to you guys. What would you like to see in terms of an update to the notification system in Android?

Who am I kidding? It’s not, but compression technology is very practical. Take Google’s new open source JPEG algorithm called Guetzli — it can dramatically reduce the size of JPEG images without loss of quality, according to ArsTechnica. As per Google’s Research Blog and GitHub, Guetzli-generated JPEG files are up to 35 percent smaller than most current JPEGs encoded with the widely-used libjpeg encoder. With smaller JPEG files, you’ll not only be able to store more pictures (and most importantly: selfies) on your phone and computer, but websites that use Guetzli-encoded JPEGs would also (at least, in theory) load faster. If all of this sounds familiar — relax, you’re not losing your mind. In 2010, Google developed WebP, a new image format that could display pictures that are up to 34 percent smaller than JPEGs. Unfortunately, WebP didn’t gain much traction because it was (and still is) only supported by Chrome and Opera. Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer never bothered to support WebP, leaving it to essentially die. Guetzli-generated photo files have no such incompatibility issues. It’ll display in all browsers because they’re just regular JPEG files. How exactly does Guetzli create smaller JPEGs? Google Research’s explanation is highly technical: In plain English, as ArsTechnica writes, Guetzli, like all JPEG encoders, tries to “reduce a large amount of disordered data, which is hard to compress, into ordered data, which is very easy to compress.” Smaller files are achieved by blurring together pixels that are similar, but only just enough to not distort the overall image’s structure. Google says it asked people whether they preferred libjpeg-encoded JPEGs or Guetzli JPEGs and most picked the latter. – Source: Mashable Ghana News Google Technology Marian Efe Ansah Tagged with: Ghana News Google Technology More on citifmonline.com Google apologises after ads appear next to extremist content March 21, 2017 YouTube responds to criticism of LGBTQ video ‘blocking’ March 20, 2017 Uber president Jeff Jones steps down March 20, 2017 US man held for sending flashing tweet to epileptic writer March 19, 2017 Teenagers build their own mental health app March 18, 2017 TECNO launches slimmest Power King smartphone March 18, 2017 General News Kintampo waterfalls closed down indefinitely March 21, 2017 Four basic schools in Walewale temporarily shut down   March 21, 2017 Newspaper Headlines: Tuesday, March 21, 2017 March 21, 2017 Marwako assault victim’s health status improves – Lawyer March 21, 2017 I have big plans for Ghana – Nana Addo March 21, 2017 Advertisement Recent Posts Kintampo waterfalls closed down indefinitely Beijing installs facial recognition in toilets to combat tissue theft Four basic schools in Walewale temporarily shut down   Newspaper Headlines: Tuesday, March 21, 2017 Google apologises after ads appear next to extremist content Marwako assault victim’s health status improves – Lawyer I have big plans for Ghana – Nana Addo German spy agency chief doubtful Gulen was behind Turkey coup attempt Koforidua SECTECH student dies after night out Top class hospitals attend Dubai-Africa health Roadshow in Accra Find us on Facebook © Copyright 2017 | citifmonline.com | All Rights Reserved.

In fact, such compression is used by many to keep the size of images on websites down in order to increase performance. But compression to this point has always resulted in either at best mostly retaining visual quality or degrading it in some way, even if it is only a very small amount. Google has changed the game however, with a new open source algorithm that will not only reduce a file's size, but also increase the perceived quality. The algorithm is called Guetzli, and it can reduce a JPEG's file size by as much as 35% while increasing the visual quality or, alternatively, image quality can be significantly improved while keeping file sizes the same.  Guetzli [guɛtsli] — which means "cookie" in Swiss German — is a JPEG encoder for digital images and web graphics that can enable faster online experiences by producing smaller JPEG files while still maintaining compatibility with existing browsers, image processing applications and the JPEG standard. This is very similar to Google's Zopfli algorithm, which produces smaller PNG and gzip files without needing to introduce a new format. It is different, however, than the techniques used in RNN-based image compression, RAISR, and WebP, which Google explains, "all need client and ecosystem changes for compression gains at internet scale."   This 16x16 is a pixel synthetic example of a phone line hanging against a blue sky — traditionally a case where JPEG compression algorithms suffer from artifacts. Uncompressed original is on the left. Guetzli (on the right) shows less ringing artifacts than libjpeg (middle) and has a smaller file size. Google says that the visual quality of JPEG images is directly correlated to its multi-stage compression process: color space transform, discrete cosine transform, and quantization. The Guetzli algorithm specifically targets the quantization stage in which the more visual quality loss is introduced, the smaller the resulting file. Google says that, "Guetzli strikes a balance between minimal loss and file size by employing a search algorithm that tries to overcome the difference between the psychovisual modeling of JPEG's format, and Guetzli’s psychovisual model, which approximates color perception and visual masking in a more thorough and detailed way than what is achievable by simpler color transforms and the discrete cosine transform." The tradeoff, however, is that while Guetzli creates smaller image files, these search algorithms take much longer to create a compressed image than any other method that is currently available.   This is a 20x24 pixel zoomed areas from a picture of a cat’s eye. Uncompressed original on the left. Guetzli (on the right) shows less ringing artifacts than libjpeg (middle) without requiring a larger file size. That said, in experimentation with the algorithm, the researchers discovered that even when files were kept at the same size, people were rating Guetzli-created images more favorably than the original. The researchers think that since the images look better to the human eye, the time it takes to generate the image is worth the tradeoff.  The Guetzli team hopes that their algorithm will help webmasters and graphic designers make users' experiences smoother on image-heavy websites, in addition to reducing load times and bandwidth costs for mobile users. They also hope that their success here, and perhaps widespread use of the algorithm, will inspire others to further delve into the image- and video- compression research space. The algorithm is on Github now, and is free to download.

By Agamoni Ghosh March 18, 2017 10:11 GMT Will the next Android OS be named after Oreo cookiesGetty Images Google is expected to preview the next version of Android OS, the Android O, most likely at the Google I/O in May. While most Android devices are still waiting for their Nougat update, rumours have started to float about the Android O. 9 to 5 Google has received some tips on how the next Android OS will shape up with an array of new features many of which will include active participation from the Google Assistant. Below are some of the early rumours on the Android O: Notification badges for active apps: Like the iOS app icons, Android O may also start giving badges for active app's notifications. This will enable the user to take a quick look at all the notifications by looking at the home screen. Notification UI change: There is no clarity on what change will be brought to the notification UI, but the report states it will be different from previous Android versions. Picture-in-picture mode: Like the Android TV, the Android O is expected to add a picture-in-picture mode, something iPads have had for quite a while. Smart text selection: This feature is expected to automatically copy relevant information from apps and show it when it is needed. Text selection can be a pain on mobiles, especially those with smaller screen sizes. The text selection will be integrated with the Google Assistant to understand what text to select. Adaptive icons: Inspired from its own smartphone Pixel's UI, the feature may allow dynamic changing of icons, which the Pixel Launcher currently does. Gesture controls: VentureBeat has suggested that the next version of Android OS may incorporate some finger gestures similar to knuckle gestures seen in Honor phones. The Android O or Android 8.0 will likely be released towards the end of the year but the name of the OS is still a mystery. Most people are vouching for Android Oreo as Google has always named its Android OS after a popular sweet treat.

Share this 0 Share this 0 Last updated: 18 March 2017, 09:30 GMT Print this story Google has been asked to explain itself after Government adverts were placed on “inappropriate and hate-filled sites”. The technology giant has been accused of “profiting from hatred” by MPs over its YouTube advertising system that saw taxpayer-funded adverts appear alongside extremist content on the video site. The Home Affairs Select Committee has now written to Google asking for an explanation. YouTube also said they do no proactive work to tackle illegal posts – not even on terrorism or online child abuse. Was shocked by that. — Yvette Cooper (@YvetteCooperMP) March 14, 2017 The Cabinet Office said it has placed a temporary restriction on its YouTube advertising “pending reassurances from Google that Government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way”, while The Guardian, Channel 4 and the BBC have also halted their advertising with the firm. Google’s advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts on websites and videos. Google’s Peter Barron was grilled by the Home Affairs Select Committee earlier this week (PA) In a letter to Google’s communications vice president Peter Barron, committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: “Government advertisements and major brands advertising is still being placed on inappropriate and hate-filled sites. “As a result Google and these organisations are still profiting from hatred. “In addition to explaining to the Government and to your advertisers how this has happened and what you are doing to prevent it ever happening again, please can you provide the Committee with a full explanation of this, including whether you will be refunding money to the Government and other advertisers.” Labour’s Yvette Cooper chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee (PA) The internet giant’s UK managing director Ronan Harris had earlier admitted the company “can and must do more” to combat what it called “bad advertising”. “We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network. “With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don’t always get it right. (Dominic Lipinski/PA) “In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetization policies,” he said. “We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more.” However, Ms Cooper said the company’s “lack of effort and social responsibility” towards the content was “extremely troubling”. Ms Cooper criticised Google’s “lack of effort and social responsibility” (PA) “It is inexplicable to us that Google can move very fast to remove material from YouTube when it is found to be copyrighted, but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves proscribed organisations and hateful and illegal content,” she said. “The Committee expects to hear from you on how you are using some of YouTube’s very significant revenue to put this problem right by devoting sufficient resources to ensure that vile and illegal material is removed proactively from your platforms, and that neither you nor those that create these videos profit from hatred.” Share this 0 Share this 0 Last updated: 18 March 2017, 09:30 GMT Advertisement Odd news  Dame Vera Lynn's image projected on white cliffs of Dover to mark 100th birthday There won't be bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover on the day the singer of the famous 1942 version of the tune turns 100, but the landmark will receive a makeover of a different kind.   Latest news videos Advertisement Most Popular Most read Most shared 1 How to fix your Windows 10 Start menu 2 Does eating late at night make you fat? 3 Windows 10 problems?

These tips are geared towards non-power users and those that are thinking about installing the Android 5.0 Lollipop update for the first time. In November, Google pushed out its initial Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system. The update brought new features to Nexus 5, Nexus 4, Nexus 7, and Nexus 10 users and it helped usher in the company’s release of the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9. Android 5.0 Lollipop also brought a number of Nexus Lollipop problems to users, problems that Google’s been trying to solve in the months after its first release. Several weeks after the initial Android 5.0 Lollipop release, Google rolled out two Lollipop bug fix updates aimed at tackling problems plaguing Nexus smartphone and tablet users. The first was Android 5.0.1 Lollipop, the other, Android 5.0.2 Lollipop. Both of these updates tackled some of more glaring Lollipop issues. Since then, Google’s been rolling out Android 5.1 Lollipop to Nexus smartphones and tablets. In April alone we’ve seen Android 5.1, a giant bug fix update, land for key Nexus devices including the Nexus 7 2013. Android 5.1 brings bug fixes and some feature tweaks to Nexus users but it also brings some Lollipop problems of its own. We’ve detailed Nexus Android 5.1 problems and it’s clear that more than a few Nexus users are suffering from random reboots, battery drain, poor connectivity, and more. And that’s why it wasn’t too surprising to see an Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update emerge at the beginning of the month. On April 1st, Google mentioned Android 5.1.1 for the first time in an update to its Android SDK. Several days ago, the Android 5.1.1 update appeared on Google’s website, a sign that a release for select Nexus devices is imminent. Today, the company released a Nexus Player Android 5.1.1 update factory image, a sign that the Android 5.1.1 OTA is about to begin. With a Nexus Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update almost here for some users, right now is the perfect time to make your final preparations for the release. Here, we want to tell you about some things you should do ahead of Google’s next big Android 5.0 Lollipop update. These pre-release tips will help Nexus users and they will come in handy should Google decide to roll out more Android 5.0-based updates in the future. Look Into Android 5.1 & Lollipop If you currently own a Nexus smartphone or tablet and you’ve somehow managed to avoid the Android 5.0 Lollipop update, now is a great time to get familiar with the update’s features. Android 5.0 Lollipop is a whole lot different than Android 4.4 KitKat and you don’t want to get blindsided if you ultimately decide to move to Android 5.1.1. We’ve reviewed the Android 5.0 Lollipop update numerous times already and that feedback will help you get started. We also recommend taking a look at the slideshow below. This slideshow compares the KitKat update to the Lollipop update and it will get you ready for the changes you will encounter if you’re moving straight from Android 4.4 KitKat to Android 5.1 Lollipop. Android 5.0 vs Android 4.4 Walkthrough: What’s New in Lollipop Android 5.0 vs Android 4.4 - Lockscreen   1 / 13  With Android 5.0 Lollipop Google has slightly improved the lockscreen. There's now a shortcut to the dialer by swiping left to right, and notifications are more useful and interactive. Shown right on the lockscreen they can be swiped away, slide down to expand, or double tap to instantly unlock right into that app or notification. Everything is simple and smooth, and we still have full-screen album artwork on the lockscreen while playing music. The quick shortcuts and improved notifications will come in handy for all users.   1 / 13 If you’re already on Android 5.0 but you haven’t moved to Android 5.1, then you’ll want to get familiar with Android 5.1 and its changes. Android 5.1 brings some tweaks, tweaks that will be present on Android 5.1.1. The slideshow below will get you caught up before the start of Google’s Android 5.1.1 Lollipop OTA process. Android 5.1 vs Android 5.0 Lollipop Walkthrough: What’s New Quick Settings   1 / 9 Our favorite new change has to do with Quick Settings. For those that don't even know, pulling down the notification bar twice (or once with two fingers) brings up a Quick Settings menu. From here you have access to screen brightness, and toggles for WiFi, Bluetooth, a flashlight, airplane mode, auto rotate settings, location, screen casting, and more quick toggles appear as you use them. Like hotspot control, and more. In all of our slides Android 5.1 is on the left, with the older Android 5.0 screenshot on the right. With Android 5.1 Lollipop Google made quick settings even better. Once you swipe down twice or once with two fingers, you'll have easier access to controlling WiFi or Bluetooth and connections. Rather than fumble through settings, simply tap the little drop down arrow, and you can connect to WiFi or Bluetooth devices all from here. This is a small but very convenient change, and one of our favorites.   1 / 9 Look Into Android 5.1.1 Update & Features Google hasn’t rolled out the red carpet yet for the Android 5.1.1 Lollipop release and it may not. The company often keeps its changelogs extremely vague. Android 5.1.1 isn’t expected to be a massive update but you’ll still want to dig around for information regarding its contents. The Android 5.1.1 change log can be found here. This is important if you’re already having a good experience on Android 5.1 or below. Android 5.1.1 comes with some key bug fixes but there’s always a chance that it could damage performance on your device. So you’ll want to research what it has on board and decide if it’s absolutely necessary to install on your phone or tablet. Research Lollipop Problems & Fixes Right now, ahead of your Android 5.1 roll out, is a perfect time to deep dive into the Android 5.0 problems currently affecting Nexus users. Lollipop delivered a number of problems to Nexus smartphones and tablets. And while Android 5.0.1, Android 5.0.2 and Android 5.1 fixed some of these problems, they failed to fix them all. If you take a look at the current climate, you’re going to get acclimated to the common problems affecting Nexus users on Android 5.0, Android 5.0.1, Android 5.0.2, and Android 5.1. This will help you handle Android 5.1.1 problems if they do happen to surface on your device after making the move. Android 5.1.1 should bring fixes but it could also bring problems. Android updates always do. We’ve outlined some potential fixes for a few of the more common Android 5.0 Lollipop problems but you’ll want to familiarize with as many issues and fixes as you can before installing Android 5.1.1. Our fixes are a great starting point but you’ll definitely want to poke around for other potential solutions. Get Familiar with Sideloading Google’s Android 5.0 Lollipop OTA releases have been extremely slow and unpredictable. If you’re the impatient type, we recommend taking a look at the manual update process (also known as sideloading) ahead of the Nexus Android 5.1.1 Lollipop release. Once the Android 5.1.1 OTAs start, someone will find the proper files lurking on Google’s severs. And once that happens, you’ll be able to install the Android 5.1.1 update ahead of Google’s slow moving Over-the-Air roll out. Sideloading Nexus software can be a tricky process and it can foul up the performance on your device. We do not recommend installing manually if you’re unfamiliar with the process. So while you have some time ahead of the Android 5.1.1 release,  you can try to get caught up on the process if you’re at all interested in skipping the OTA process. This guide on how to install the Nexus 4 Android 5.1 Lollipop update should get you up to speed though there are plenty of other resources out there that will help you learn about sideloading ahead of the OTA. If you’re not comfortable after doing your research, you should wait for the OTA from Google to arrive. Clean Up Your Nexus Right now, ahead of the Android 5.1.1 release, is a great time to perform some clean up your Nexus smartphone or tablet. This is going to be especially important to those of you jumping to Android 5.0 for the first time. The Lollipop update requires a ton of storage to install and that’s going to pose problems for those of you that have collected a ton of apps and files over the years. Nexus devices don’t have microSD card slots so it’s very easy to use up your internal storage space. You’ve likely downloaded applications or music or other files that you simply don’t use any more. Now is a great time to get rid of those applications and files that you no longer need to house on your internal storage. It will get rid of any clutter and also free up some valuable storage space on your tablet ahead of the Android 5.1.1 release date for your device. Back Up Your Files Thanks to the cloud and Google’s auto backup features, most of your important files are probably secure. That said, you’re going to want to ensure that you’ve backed up all of your important photos, videos, app data, and more before installing Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. There’s always a chance, albeit a small one, that something could get ruined during the transition from whatever you’re on to Android 5.1.1. The first thing you’ll want to do is ensure that Auto Backup is turned on for your important files. To do this, head over to Google’s website. It offers in-depth Auto Backup tutorials that will ensure that your precious files will be stored safely ahead of Android 5.0’s release.We also have some tips that will help you backup your files properly. It would also be smart to check on your cloud-based services (if you use them) to ensure that your files are still backed up. Again, this might seem tedious but you simply never know how the installation process is going to work out. Charge Your Device You’re going to want to ensure that your device is fully charged or at least charged enough where it’s not going to power down on you during the Android 5.1.1 installation process. The safest route to take is to ensure that your device is at least 50% charged before installing a new update. The download and installation process probably won’t ruin your battery life but you still don’t want to run the risk of having your device die during the installation process. Charge up your Nexus smartphone or tablet before downloading and installing your new software. It won’t hurt. Update Your Apps There is always a chance that a third-party app or a stock app will start misbehaving after a major Android update. There isn’t much you can do to prevent this though we’ve have some success updating our apps prior to updating to the new software. Android developers do their best to alleviate these problems as quickly as humanly possible and the best way you can help your own cause is by installing the latest bug fixes. Most apps should work after you get Android 5.1.1 on board but if you’re seeing issues after updating, you should get in contact with the developer, even if it’s Google. Check in With IT If you’re using your Nexus smartphone or tablet for work and you happen to have an IT department, you should go and chat with them before installing your Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update. Nexus users that use their device for work often run into issues with enterprise software, Wi-Fi connections, Exchange, and other important work-related features after installing Android updates. It literally happens every year after every Nexus Android release. Android 5.1.1 patched some things up but you can never be too sure. There’s is a chance that your IT department might have a recommendation ahead of the Android 5.1.1 release. Often times, that advice is to avoid the update until they’re able to confirm that it’s working with key services. If you don’t have an IT department, you might want to hold off until you can gather feedback from co-workers or developers. Check in With Developers Finally, if you’ve installed custom software on your Nexus device and you’re unsure about how to proceed, you’ll want to get in touch with the developers and the Android community before installing the Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update. A lot of the initial Android update problems we see come from people who are trying to sideload the software and those who are coming from a customized version of Android back to stock. If you aren’t running stock and you are thinking about sideloading or installing Android 5.1.1 down the road, keep an eye on your community. XDA-Developers is a great resource if you don’t know where to turn. 4 Responses 07/26/2015 Loris Prier Reply I have a message telling me to install a system download, but when I press the install button, nothing happens. Please respond by email with the necessary steps I need to take, or your phone number so we can discuss this. Thank you! 08/13/2015 I. Selby Reply Hi. I updated to Nexus 5.1.1 yesterday and am already experiencing a tiny but niggling issue. On some apps (not all, mostly games) the app used to just play normally, fulk screen, no issues. Now this ‘status bar’ will overlay itself, over the full screen game, covering part of the screen. It’s incredibly annoying and I haven’t worked out how to get rid of it. Furthermore, I use McAfee antivirus on my Nexus. On the home screen a tiny little green button appears that you can click to use it as a shortcut to open the app. This WAS helpful before the update but has now contributed to the pest nonsense by also making an appearance when the status bar issue occurs. Any idea on a fix? Woukd be greatly appreciated. I tried checking some options but couldn’t see anything. Preferably a fix without developer options btw as I know I can disable the bar completely but my ideal outcome is just to get it to stop becoming an overlay in various apps. It’s quite annoying. Thanks. 12/05/2016 rapid fire mods Reply I really like reading through a post that can make men and women think.

It’s one of the most popular games on Android and iOS, with good reason. It’s extremely fun and very addicting. However, occasionally users run into problems. Like changing their name, transferring a village or switching to a new device. We get asked a lot of questions about Clash. From transferring the game from an iPhone to an Android tablet, switching phones, connection problems, lost villages and more. There are countless problems that can easily be fixed, or otherwise solved with the help of Clash of Clans support. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Typically users don’t run into actual in-game problems. Instead, most of the questions being asked in forums are about minor things. However, there are still occasional bugs or problems you could face. The first stop for users is the official Clash of Clans support forum. Then continue on for more details and help with some potential Clash of Clans problems. With millions and millions of players on both Android and iOS, this game has its share of problems. The biggest concern for most comes from a lost village. With that said we’ll start with always backing up your Clash of Clans account or village. This can be done with Game Center, or Google+ on both platforms. Among other ways. Additionally, in January of 2017 the developers announced they are ending support for any device running iOS 5 or older. This doesn’t apply to most players, but if it does, learn more details here. Update your device or transfer your village before it’s too late. How to Backup Clash of Clans First things first, gamers should always tie Clash of Clans to either Game Center on iPhone and iPad, or use Google+ and Google Games on Android. This is a crucial step that ties the game to your Apple ID or Gmail. Perfect in case of loss, theft, damage to a device, or other situations. Start by opening Clash of Clans and hitting the settings button, which are three gear-shaped icons in a box near the bottom right. This is the main settings menu. In the middle and bottom is the important stuff. From transferring the game to another device, connecting to Facebook, or tying your game to Google or Apple’s Game Center. Click the bottom middle option and connect to Google Play, or the bottom for Game Center. This ensures you’ll always be able to recover your game. I’ve connected to Google+ with my gmail account. No matter what Android device I have, I can download Clash of Clans, connect to Google, and it will automatically transfer my entire village in seconds. I have the same village on more than one phone, and two different Android tablets. Read: Clash of Clans Update Problems Frustrate Gamers The same goes for Game Center. Simply connect to game center at the bottom of this settings screen, which will instantly connect Clash to that iOS device. With Android users can simply transfer the entire village with Google+, but iOS requires Game Center and using a link code. The bottom left is where you’ll need to click to connect to Game Center This is the first step all users should take, to ensure they’ll never lose a village. If this isn’t done, Supercell might be able to recover a village if you know the email account, name, clan name and other information, but it could take days or weeks to be recovered. How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Whether it’s on Android or iOS, the process of transferring the game is rather easy. With iOS and Game Center you’ll need a device linking code. However, you’ll need both devices side by side to enter the code, or write it down. It’s crucial that you follow the first step mentioned above, and sign into Game Center or Google+ on your current device first before trying to transfer the game. Better safe than sorry. Read: How to Fix Clash of Clans Device Not Compatible Error  With Android, transferring your Clash of Clans village to a new device (phone or tablet) couldn’t be easier thanks to Google Play Games, and Google+. Download Clash of Clans on your new smartphone or tablet, go through the tutorial, then follow the steps from the video below. Simply connect and sign into Google+ inside the game and it transfers the data over. The process is slightly different with iOS, and users will need to use Game Center and the “link a device” code button shown at the end of the video, or in the screenshot below. Tap this to get started. With iPhone or iPad you’ll need the old device and the new one, which can be a problem if a device is lost or stolen. If so, contact Supercell for further assistance. On iOS hit settings > Link a device > and tap “this is the OLD DEVICE“. Clash will generate a code for you. Leave this on the screen, write it down, or take a screenshot. Do not lose it. Download Clash of Clans on your new iPhone or iPad, follow the same steps as above, but click “this is the NEW DEVICE” and enter the code. Sign into Game Center, and Clash will transfer to your new iOS device. It’s worth mentioning that if you download Clash on a new device and buy gems, or progress past Town Hall level 4, you can’t transfer your old game data. Meaning you’ll have to uninstall and reinstall the game, then try the transfer. So don’t play at all, and just follow the steps above to transfer an old village. If you try to transfer a village but your Gmail is tied to the wrong one, make a new Google account and re-connect it. Head to settings > accounts > add account > Google and make a new Google account. Then open Clash, and sync your current game to a new Google account. Then try again on your new device, and it should load the right village. Find a Lost Village If you have lost your Clash of Clans account or village by losing a phone, getting it stolen, broke, uninstalling the game or doing a factory data reset and did not have it backed up, only the support team can help you. Start the game, hit settings, and press “Help & Support” to get started. Users can also proceed by contacting Clash of Clans support here. Head to Help & Support, and tap the “Start a conversation” button on the top right. This will connect you with Supercell support, and they can try and track down and find your lost account. Having a unique name makes this easier. The following information will be needed to find a lost village: Name of the lost village Name of the clan the lost village is a part of (to help track it down) Town Hall level of your lost village Last date & time played Player level in village (if available) Provide all the details you possibly can, do not delete the pre-populated information on the lost village page, and Supercell may be able to find and restore your village. If you lost the village on iOS for any reason and didn’t have it backed up to Game center, the same steps as above will be required. Depending on the uniqueness of the name, clan name, and available information Supercell support should be able to find and restore your village. If the Clan name is “Clash of Clans” or something generic, where thousands of others used the same, it may be more difficult. Always have a unique player and clan name. Fix for “Link Error 102” Sometimes users may run into an odd “link error 102” while trying to play or transfer Clash of Clans using the device link code. In order for the link to work often-times both devices need to be connected to the same internet connection. Meaning connect both the old and new device to the same WiFi connection at home, or a public WiFi hotspot like at Starbucks. If one device is a smartphone, and you don’t have WiFi, tether the internet connection in and connect your tablet or the other device to the original, so they’re on the same network, and retry the link code. If this still fails, try another wireless network. Connect both devices to a friends wireless network, a public library, Starbucks, or AT&T WiFi spots around many cities. If this still fails, use the in-game support tab mentioned above and answer all of Supercell’s questions, and a support member may be able to resolve the issue. How to Change Your Name Changing your name in Clash of Clans was nearly impossible until an update to the game back in April of 2015. In April Clash of Clans received an update with tons of new features, as well as the option to change your in-game name once. This can only be done for Town Hall level 5 and above. Read: How to Change Your Name in Clash of Clans While on the regular home area looking at your base, tap the 3-gears shaped button near the bottom right of the screen. Then tap “Settings” and select the “Change Name” button. A box will pop-up instructing the user to change their name, but you will be warned this can only be done once. And one time only. Now that Clash of Clans has this as an option, you can only do it once. So choose wisely. Simply enter the new name you’d like to enjoy during gameplay, and select continue. You’ll be prompted to write it again confirming it’s what you want, then a third confirmation page will make you write CONFIRM in all caps. This is to ensure this is the name you want to use, and users will once again be reminded this is their one and only name change. If for whatever reason you’d like to change it again, you probably can’t, but emailing support with a valid reason the staff may grant users a second chance. This won’t be as easy, but it is possible. Gem Purchase Didn’t Come Through While most in-game purchases for things like gems goes extremely smooth, occasionally Android and iOS users will have problems. Sometimes the Android, Apple, or Supercell servers may respond slowly, return an error, or fail. If this is the case users are recommended to wait a few minutes, check their email to see if it went through. If the purchase was accepted, wait a few minutes and the purchase should show up. Try closing the game and restarting it. And the gems should arrive. Gem hacks typically don’t work, and those with a jailbroken iPhone can sometimes cause other issues. If a purchase isn’t received within 24 hours, contact the Google Play Store or iTunes for a refund. Supercell cannot verify a purchase if it doesn’t clear, so users need to request a refund through the app store. Click here for more details. On Android the process is easier, and if you received an email that you bought gems, the same in-game support tab should usually resolve the issue. Gems Disappeared Gems don’t just disappear in Clash of Clans. The only way for them to be gone, is if they’re used. Meaning buying a shield, a builders hut, boosting, spending gems on gold, elixir or dark elixir, or speeding up building or troop upgrades. If gems are used accidentally by friends, family members, or children, too bad. Supercell cannot or will not refund gems that are accidentally used. However, if a purchase or connection problem caused lost gems, try the step mentioned above, or contact support. Can’t Find A Clan in Search Searching for a Clan in Clash of Clans can be challenging, simply because there are millions of players. Open the game, and hit the blue “i” button by your name near the top left. Then select “search clans“. If you can’t find the clan in search it’s because the name wasn’t original, and too many others used the same name. Make sure you know the clan name, badge design and colors. Even the Clan War level can help you find the right one. How to Play on Android and iPhone Yes, you can play the same Clash of Clans village on both platforms. Playing Clash of Clans on your iPhone, but also want to play it at home on your Samsung Galaxy Tab or Nexus 7? Here’s how: To play the same village on two different devices that aren’t both Android or iPhone, uses the same steps as above. Use the link code instructions above and transfer your iPhone Clash of Clans village to a new device, which can be an Android device. Your village will still be accessible on both devices. Again, always sync to Game Center or Google+ to save progress. Other Clash of Clans Problems Overall there aren’t too many issues in Clash of Clans. It’s one of the most popular, stable, and best games on Android or iOS. While most of the issues users face have been detailed above, if you have any other issues head to the Clash of Clans support forum. If the game isn’t loading try rebooting your phone. If updates are failing try closing the game, closing apps like the App Store or Google Play, re-opening, and trying again. Typically these are all connection issues, not related to Clash itself. Slow load times, searching in matchmaking and other things are often based on connection, base layout, and other variables. If you have any other problems hit the link above and ask someone on the official forums, try the in-game support system, or drop us a comment below. 73 Responses 12/04/2015 Salinajhone Reply 15 my best friend’s step-sister makes $62 every hour on the laptop .

From a free 43-inch HDTV, a free Google Home, buy one get one and more. Following months of leaks and rumors LG finally made their impressive new smartphone official on February 25th. Revealing a sleek new 5.7-inch LG G6 that’s water-resistant, has three cameras, and extremely slim bezels. It has a lot to offer and plenty of consumers are excited. Read: LG G6 Release Date Breakdown & Pricing In case you missed it, the LG G6 will be available to pre-order in the United States on March 17th. All major carriers have made announcements. It will start at $650 or $26 a month from T-Mobile, or nearly $700 from other carriers. It’s an expensive phone. Luckily, most buyers will get some awesome freebies as part of newly announced LG G6 deals. These are the best LG G6 deals and promotions Below buyers can find a continuously updating list of the absolute best LG G6 deals and discounts. Allowing you to not only get the hottest new phone, but save money at the same time. For more information on the LG G6 see our hands-on video, or check the link below. Then read on for some impressive launch-day deals. Read: LG G6 Features: 7 You’ll Love & 2 You’ll Hate For 2017 the company completely ditched the modular design we saw with the LG G5. It wasn’t popular, and instead their taking an approach similar to Samsung or Apple. The LG G6 is a premium all metal and glass phone. It has a huge screen, tiny bezels so its easy to hold, great cameras, and IP68 dust and water resistance. Additionally, there’s a micro-SD slot to expand storage and the latest Android 7.0 Nougat software. There’s a lot to like, so lets find some great discounts or savings before you buy one. LG G6 Deals First off, everyone who pre-orders or gets an LG G6 during the first month or so of it being available are in for a treat. As earlier announced, anyone who buys the LG G6 will get a free Google Home. The voice-controlled speaker and virtual assistant from Google, which is similar to Amazon Alexa. Simply buy an LG G6 and save your receipt. Then head to this LG promo website and fill it out to receive a free Google Home. That’s a $129 value absolutely free. It doesn’t matter which carrier, as any purchase applies. We were expecting some sort of free case or micro-SD deal like prior years, or to compete with Samsung but that doesn’t appear to be the case. Instead of expanding storage all owners will get the awesome Google Home. It’s a great product that many will enjoy. When you get it, say this command: “OK Google, I’m Feeling Lucky” and enjoy the results. Verizon LG G6 Deals In case you missed it in our release date breakdown, the LG G6 will be available from Verizon before any other US carrier. Pre-orders begin March 17th, and it will be available online and in stores starting March 30th. All other carriers will offer the G6 from April 7th. Get a free LG 43-inch Smart TV when you buy the LG G6 from Verizon Wireless. This is a limited time promotion, and we’re still looking for more details. Either way, once you buy the LG G6 from Verizon and get your free Google Home, head to this promotion website to claim your free 43-inch TV. This is one of the best deals we’ve seen in a while. As a reminder, the LG G6 is $28 a month for 24 months from Verizon, or $672 at full price. AT&T LG G6 Deals As the release date arrives and passes we can expect more deals and discounts to surface. Everyone is eligible for the free Google Home, so AT&T customers can start there. However, that isn’t all this carrier has to offer. Buy an LG G6 from AT&T and get one free. It isn’t actually free, but the carrier will simply credit your account $24 each month for $30 months, which is what you’ll pay for the first one. So it’s two for the price of one. Of course adding it to a plan will cost money, but you get the phone absolutely free. In addition to the buy one get one free deal, AT&T is also offering the new LG Watch Sport with Android Wear 2.0 for just $49.99 outright. As long as you sign a 2-year contract to have data on the watch. This is usually an extra $10 a month on your phone bill, but makes the watch work for calls and other things without being tethered to a phone. So get two LG G6 phones and LG’s newest smartwatch all for cheap with AT&T. T-Mobile, Sprint & Others As of right now we have no additional details regarding LG G6 deals from other carriers. We can expect T-Mobile to make some announcements in the near future, and Sprint may do the same just to compete with other carriers. Again, any carrier (including T-Mobile or Sprint) are eligible for the free Google Home. It doesn’t matter where you buy it, just head here and enter your information for a free Google Assistant-powered speaker. That being said, we can expect Best Buy to offer some sort of awesome deal too. Over the past few years they’ve been one of the best places to buy a smartphone. Typically offering at least a $100 discount over carrier pricing, in addition to a $100 Best Buy gift card. We’ve also seen them offer free microSD cards, discounts on accessories, and similar deals on a smartwatch. So while nothing has been announced yet, check back soon as this list will continuously be updated with the best LG G6 deals. While you’re here, take a look at these 10 Best LG G6 cases shown below. 15 Best LG G6 Cases Spigen Rugged Armor   1 / 15 Spigen is a brand that needs no introduction, as they've offered some of the best cases for almost every phone for the past couple of years. One of my favorites always happens to be the Spigen Rugged Armor. It has a sleek design, two-tone finish with a textured grip on the top and bottom, and fits with precision.  The company makes a wide assortment of cases, so we'd recommend choosing one that's right for you. They also come in a slew of colors, sizes, and with varying levels of protection.  With the Spigen Rugged Armor you'll have a case that isn't too thick, but not too thin. They've added a resilient shock absorber material to the inside edges for added drop protection, and finished it off with a carbon-fiber look and feel. It's available right now.  Buy it on Amazon for $14.99   1 / 15 2 Responses 03/16/2017 thinki'llpass Reply This would be the speaker that inflicts advertising on you in the (former) privacy of your own home? http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-home-tests-unsolicited-audio-ad-to-grumbles-2017-03-16 boyoboy, i can hardly wait… /s 03/18/2017 JENNIFER FREELAND Reply I love LG, I just can’t afford them until 2-3 new ones are already out.

Wochit Tech Tips for Online Privacy Online privacy is a hot topic. Many of the big-name websites and companies will track your activities to deliver targeted advertising, and can build up an astonishingly detailed profile including your interests, spending habits, age, location and more. If you would prefer to keep your personal details private, a VPN or proxy tool will help. As well as preventing third parties building up a profile of you, the best free privacy software can open up the web, granting you access to sites blocked in your country, to access region-locked content when you're traveling away from home, and to add a layer of protection when you use a public Wi-Fi network. To Get started, try these two programs: Tor Browser is probably the best-known anonymous browsing tool. It works by bouncing your communication through numerous encrypted nodes on the internet, making it impossible to determine your location or other identifying information. Privoxy is a web proxy tool. this free privacy software lets you set up advanced filters that will not only ensure you remain anonymous online, but also protect you against unwanted ads. Wochit Tech Galaxy S8 Will Be More Powerful in China Everyone expects the Samsung Galaxy S8 to be a powerful phone, but it could be even more powerful in China. Word has it that the Galaxy S8 may come with 6GB of RAM in China compared with 4GB for the rest of the world, according to IHS research director Kevin Wang. More RAM means your phone can do more things at once, like run a number of apps without bogging down. The Galaxy S8 is rumored to be coming with two different chipsets. Wochit Tech SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO The PlayStation 3 is about to die. Sony has announced that it will soon end production of the console in Japan. It's likely that it will stop being made everywhere else soon after. The company hasn't announced the date that production will come to an end, or made a public announcement about it. But on Sony's website it lists the 500GB standard model as the only one remaining in production in the country, and states that "shipments are scheduled to end soon". A tweet from a gaming shop in Japan suggests that shipments will come to an end in March. © Provided by Independent Print Limited The console was first released in November 2006. It was superceded in 2014, by the PlayStation 4. Sony has stated before that it works on a ten-year production cycle for all of its consoles, and so the console is coming to an end almost exactly as scheduled. The end of production doesn't mean that anything will happen to existing PlayStation consoles. But it does mean that support will likely be cut off soon – the company is likely to slow down updates at the same time, potentially meaning that problems with the online services and digital downloads could go unfixed for some time, or at all. It's likely that some consoles will continue to be sold throughout the year. But they will probably be in shorter supply, potentially pushing up the resale value of the system.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Google New Chrome 57 update will finally stop Google’s browser from melting your CPU Zach Epstein @zacharye March 15th, 2017 at 8:57 AM Share Tweet According to data from market research firm Net Applications, Google’s Chrome web browser is the most popular desktop browser in the world by a substantial margin. At last count, Chrome’s global market share sat at 58.53% in February, up slightly from 57.94% in the prior month. The #2 browser in the world, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, fell about half a point to 19.17% in February, and Firefox inches downward to 11.68% in the #3 spot. Chrome has plenty of advantages over rival browsers, which is why it has become so popular over the years despite Microsoft’s clear advantage — the company’s Internet Explorer and Edge browsers ship on every PC sold that runs Windows. Of course, Chrome still has its fair share of issues despite its popularity, and a new update released on Tuesday night addresses users’ biggest complaint. Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 “Efficient power usage is an important aspect of speed, one of Chrome’s key pillars,” Google’s Alexander Timin wrote in a post on the company’s Chromium blog. “To prolong battery life, Chrome should minimize power impact from things users can’t see. This includes background tabs, which consume a third of Chrome’s power usage on desktop. Starting in version 57, Chrome will throttle individual background tabs by limiting the timer fire rate for background tabs using excessive power.” As anyone who uses the Chrome web browser can attest to, the software can be something of a resource hog when multiple tabs are open in the background. There is perhaps no desktop application that causes more PC fans to kick on around the world than Chrome. That may now come to an end, however, as Chrome 57 marks the start of more effective background tab throttling that puts better limits on resource utilization. “Chrome has focused on improving the user experience by throttling tab performance for many years,” Timin wrote. “Like many browsers, Chrome has limited timers in the background to only run once per second. Via the new throttling policy, Chrome 57 will delay timers to limit average CPU load to 1% of a core if an application uses too much CPU in background. Tabs playing audio or maintaining real-time connections like WebSockets or WebRTC won’t be affected.” The Google engineer noted that Chrome 57’s new background tab throttling mechanism typically results in 25% fewer busy tabs running in the background.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Google accused of `profiting from hatred´ by MPs over YouTube advertising system By Press Association Published: 04:18 EDT, 18 March 2017 | Updated: 04:18 EDT, 18 March 2017 e-mail Google has been asked to explain itself after Government adverts were placed on “inappropriate and hate-filled sites”. The technology giant has been accused of “profiting from hatred” by MPs over its YouTube advertising system that saw taxpayer-funded adverts appear alongside extremist content on the video site. The Home Affairs Select Committee has now written to Google asking for an explanation. YouTube also said they do no proactive work to tackle illegal posts - not even on terrorism or online child abuse. Was shocked by that.— Yvette Cooper (@YvetteCooperMP) March 14, 2017 The Cabinet Office said it has placed a temporary restriction on its YouTube advertising “pending reassurances from Google that Government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way”, while The Guardian, Channel 4 and the BBC have also halted their advertising with the firm. Google’s advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts on websites and videos. Google's Peter Barron was grilled by the Home Affairs select committee earlier this week (PA) In a letter to Google’s communications vice president Peter Barron, committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: “Government advertisements and major brands advertising is still being placed on inappropriate and hate-filled sites. “As a result Google and these organisations are still profiting from hatred. “In addition to explaining to the Government and to your advertisers how this has happened and what you are doing to prevent it ever happening again, please can you provide the Committee with a full explanation of this, including whether you will be refunding money to the Government and other advertisers.” Labour's Yvette Cooper chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee (PA) The internet giant’s UK managing director Ronan Harris had earlier admitted the company “can and must do more” to combat what it called “bad advertising”. “We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network. “With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don’t always get it right. The logo of internet search engine Google reflected in a pair of glasses “In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetization policies,” he said. “We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more.” However, Ms Cooper said the company’s “lack of effort and social responsibility” towards the content was “extremely troubling”. Ms Cooper said Google's lack of action was worrying (PA) “It is inexplicable to us that Google can move very fast to remove material from YouTube when it is found to be copyrighted, but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves proscribed organisations and hateful and illegal content,” she said. “The Committee expects to hear from you on how you are using some of YouTube’s very significant revenue to put this problem right by devoting sufficient resources to ensure that vile and illegal material is removed proactively from your platforms, and that neither you nor those that create these videos profit from hatred.” Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

TAG Heuer on Tuesday unveiled the new generation of a US$1,650 (RM7,322) smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel. Two days later, Montblanc followed with the US$890 Summit. Also on Thursday, Swatch Group Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers during the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple Inc., and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch.” US$15,000 watches Instead, they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear anything on their wrist, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as US$10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while TAG Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about US$15,000.  The original version of the Apple Watch starts at US$269. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities LLP. So far, Swiss watch makers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest releases represent a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands only planned to make “intelligent watch-straps” and that putting electronic functions into the watch case creates a danger of obsolescence for time-honoured watchmaking practices. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.” TAG Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they ever decided it was obsolete. For the new version introduced this week, which is Swiss-made, TAG Heuer is offering a module for an extra US$1,650 that can swap the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Google, Apple Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget, which is made in China. The US tech firm has partnered with LG, and in February Huawei launched the company’s Watch 2. Models from Motorola, Sony and Fossil also run Google’s operating system. High-profile failures, such as the death of a US$17,000 luxury version of the Apple Watch and the end of smartwatch pioneer Pebble, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared in a report this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IWC had an intelligent watch-strap plan that never saw the light of day, while Tissot is behind schedule on its Smart Touch watch, which would work with iOS and Android. IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were shipped last year, missing a previous forecast of 28.3 million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9 per cent in 2016 while shipments at Samsung rose 39 per cent, according to the firm. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches in 2016, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19 months of declining exports. Swatch this week forecast a rebound in US and European markets after previously reporting improvement in Asia and the Mideast. Guy estimates that TAG Heuer got slightly less than 10 per cent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch in 2016. If the technology remains a niche product for the Swiss makers, that might be a good thing, he said. Otherwise, they risk a slippery slope in which lower-priced timepieces undercut their sales. “Watchmakers have to be careful not to start to dilute their own brand equity by launching too many smartwatches,” Guy said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Hacked websites on the rise, Google confirms Singapore beats Silicon Valley for start-up talents, survey finds Adobe, Microsoft team up to share sales and marketing data Meet Bixby, Samsung’s new artificial intelligence assistant Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Google could have three Pixel handsets in store for late 2017 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Tiger Woods signs copies of his new book ‘The 1997 Masters: My Story’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles TAG Heuer gets smart with the Connected Modular 45 Is the MyKronoz ZeTime the future of smartwatch design?

The technology giant has been accused of "profiting from hatred" by MPs over its YouTube advertising system that saw taxpayer-funded adverts appear alongside extremist content on the video site. The Home Affairs Select Committee has now written to Google asking for an explanation. The Cabinet Office said it has placed a temporary restriction on its YouTube advertising "pending reassurances from Google that Government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way", while The Guardian, Channel 4 and the BBC have also halted their advertising with the firm. Google's advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts on websites and videos.  In a letter to Google's communications vice president Peter Barron, committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: "Government advertisements and major brands advertising is still being placed on inappropriate and hate-filled sites. "As a result Google and these organisations are still profiting from hatred. "In addition to explaining to the Government and to your advertisers how this has happened and what you are doing to prevent it ever happening again, please can you provide the Committee with a full explanation of this, including whether you will be refunding money to the Government and other advertisers." The internet giant's UK managing director Ronan Harris had earlier admitted the company "can and must do more" to combat what it called "bad advertising". "We've begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network. "With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don't always get it right. "In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetization policies," he said. "We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more." However, Ms Cooper said the company's "lack of effort and social responsibility" towards the content was "extremely troubling".  "It is inexplicable to us that Google can move very fast to remove material from YouTube when it is found to be copyrighted, but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves proscribed organisations and hateful and illegal content," she said. "The Committee expects to hear from you on how you are using some of YouTube's very significant revenue to put this problem right by devoting sufficient resources to ensure that vile and illegal material is removed proactively from your platforms, and that neither you nor those that create these videos profit from hatred."  Media advertising firm GroupM has suggested "a 100% foolproof system" to prevent further incidents may not be possible. The firm, which is part of advertising giant WPP, also warned that Google and YouTube's tools to stop bad advert placement were "not infallible" in a letter to clients.  GroupM's chief digital officer Rob Norman said the technology giant should apologise over the incident.  "We believe Google owes two apologies, one to advertisers for compromising their brand reputations and the other to consumers for the presence of the content," he said. "Google should also make clear that the flaw is in Google's controls, so no consumer may think that a brand, through its adjacency, is an endorser of the content." 18 March 2017 7:15AM View comments Most Commented Win a £1,000 garden makeover with Quattro Products and the News & Star 65 Midwife facing disciplinary action after speaking out about hospital maternity decision 10 Work set to start on controversial castle crossing in Carlisle 8 Carlisle amputee teen hit with SECOND hospital parking ticket 4 Sturgeon plans to trigger second Scotland independence vote 3 Most Read 16,000 chickens killed in huge fire near Carlisle Carlisle girl, 10, told she wouldn't get school dinner because of £4 debt Young north Cumbrian woman killed in crash Three arrested after bloody incident in Carlisle Woman who died in tragic Cumbrian crash named More news   Inflation is forecast to come in just shy of the Bank of England's 2% target Food and fuel prices set to push up inflation Martin McGuinness has died aged 66 Martin McGuinness dies aged 66 Yorkshire's new captain Gary Ballance has signed a new deal Gary Ballance signs two-year extension to Yorkshire contract Chief Superintendent Mark Pannone Cumbria police deal with huge increase in mental health crisis cases Wales' George North, left, complained about an alleged bite during the game against France Six Nations officials: No evidence found over alleged bite on George North Quick searches Carlisle Airport Carlisle United Court cases Cumberland Infirmary Sellafield West Cumberland Hospital Featured articles   Don't get caught out with new mobile phone laws: find out the dos and don'ts Venus shining brightly in the night sky Why the planet Venus is shining so bright in the Cumbrian night sky JOBS PROPERTY MOTORS LOCAL BUSINESSES READER TRAVEL BUY PHOTOS PLACE AN AD DATING Contact Us News & Star Newspaper House, Dalston Road Carlisle, Cumbria CA2 5UA 01228 612600 Contact us online here Facebook Twitter YouTube Sitemap Home | News | Carlisle Utd | Sport | Motors | Property | Jobs | Contact Us | Lifestyle | Family Notices | Buy photos | Place an ad | Buy and Sell | Readers Travel | Subscriptions | Business Directory | Dating | Pets in Cumbria Services Subscriptions | Jobs | Property | Motors | Travel | Dating | Family Notices | Pets CN Group News & Star | Cumberland News | Times & Star | Whitehaven News | Hexham Courant | NW Evening Mail | Eskdale & Liddesdale Advertiser | Cumbria Life | Carlisle Living | Dumfries and Galloway Life | in-cumbria | The Bay | Lakeland Radio | Cumbria Live | Choose Cumbria | CN-Jobs | clickin2 | Business directory | Reader holidays | CN Group | Privacy policy © 2017 CN Group back to top

Developing a driverless car, he’s often said, is “existential” to Uber. Company Summary NSE BSE Pittsburgh Loading data... ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 By Max Chafkin and Mark Bergen Travis Kalanick, the chief executive officer of Uber Technologies Inc., says he needs leadership help. He recently dispatched former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate sexual harassment claims against the company. His security team is reviewing a practice known as “Greyballing.” And he’s no longer planning to go to meetings with President Trump. These damage-control initiatives—in response, respectively, to a leaked video in which Kalanick was rude to an Uber driver, a blog post by a former engineer, an admission that the company had been deliberately misleading police, and a customer boycott—were the result of a month’s worth of public-relations disasters. Taken alone, any of these would have been enough to slow down the famously fast-moving ride-hailing company. Taken together, they’ve caused some to question Uber’s viability and Kalanick’s staying power. But none of these scandals has the potential financial impact of the one Uber has said the least about: a lawsuit from Alphabet Inc.—the parent of Google and Google’s self-driving car division, now called Waymo—over driverless cars. Waymo says Uber is in possession of, and is basing the future of its business on, technology that was stolen by a former employee. Self-driving technology has become a fixation for Kalanick. Developing a driverless car, he’s often said, is “existential” to Uber. If a competitor managed to get there first, it could easily replicate Uber’s core service (shuttling passengers) without its single largest cost (paying drivers). Over the course of a few weeks in 2015, Kalanick poached 40 researchers from the Carnegie Mellon University robotics lab, one of the country’s top autonomous vehicle research centers. Then, last summer, Uber became the first company to operate a fleet of autonomous taxis, in downtown Pittsburgh. On the day it announced that service, Uber also said it had acquired Otto, a self-driving truck startup founded in January 2016 by a former Google employee, Anthony Levandowski. The 37-year-old engineer was an original member of Google’s car team and a protégé of its creator, Sebastian Thrun. At Google, Levandowski had been both a brilliant engineer and a divisive manager, with a reputation for flouting corporate norms and skirting rules to get cars on the road as quickly as possible. He was so controversial, according to several former and current employees, that when he was being considered to lead the car team, a group of engineers revolted, causing Alphabet CEO Larry Page to rethink the choice and install a different leader, Chris Urmson. According to the legal complaint filed on behalf of Google’s driverless car division—as almost everyone at Waymo still refers to it—the company began investigating Levandowski last summer after learning that Uber had paid about $700 million for his months-old company. Google’s suit, filed in a San Francisco federal court, says its investigators uncovered a trove of digital evidence that hint at an unprecedented theft. According to the suit, Levandowski used his company laptop to download 14,000 design files from Google’s car project. He plugged a memory card reader into the laptop and, shortly afterward, wiped all the data from the laptop. The suit also alleges that two other Otto employees took files on their way out the door. Google seemed content to sit on that information until Dec. 13, when a Google employee received an email from a supplier that was working on components for the lidar sensor in the company’s first production car. Lidar—a portmanteau of “light” and “radar”—is the key component that allows an autonomous vehicle to, essentially, see its surroundings. (It’s also used to build maps.) Off-the-shelf sensors cost up to $80,000 and contain several individual lenses. Under Levandowski, who’d led the lidar team, Google developed a much cheaper version that used a single lens. Strangely, though, the email’s subject line—“Otto Files”— made reference to Levandowski’s company. According to Google’s suit, the contents of the email, which seemed to have been intended for Uber rather than Google, included a machine drawing of a lidar circuit board that had Otto’s name on it but looked almost identical to Google’s. Two months later, Waymo sued Uber for trade secret theft and patent infringement, seeking damages and an injunction that could seriously impede Uber’s self-driving car program. At issue is a business that both companies believe will be worth hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars a year. And though both companies like to portray driverless cars as some near-term inevitability, this dispute shows just how messy the race to get there could prove to be. During new-hire orientation, engineers at Google are frequently told that the company will never sue a former employee for patent infringement. The implication is twofold: first, that Google doesn’t stoop to fighting over patents, though it may employ them to protect itself from people who aren’t in the business of changing the world. (“These patent wars are death,” Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said at an event in 2012, calling patent litigation “bad for innovation.”) And, as an extension of that, if Google sues you over a patent issue, you must have really pissed them off. After the lawsuit was filed, Uber released a statement characterizing it as “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.” At an all-hands meeting at the company’s Pittsburgh research center, Levandowski defended Uber’s lidar technology as “clean”—that is, not the product of stolen design documents—and told the company’s engineers that he’d downloaded the files to work from home. Some former colleagues seem to think that even if Levandowski did what Google alleges, he doesn’t deserve to be punished. “Whatever Google may say about him stealing lidar trade secrets, he was the lidar team at Google,” says someone who worked at the company’s driverless car program. “This is like the Swiss patent office suing Einstein for inventing the theory of relativity while he worked there.” The comparison to Einstein is obviously hyperbolic, but it also captures the foundational role Levandowski played in the development of self-driving cars. Levandowski, 6-foot-6 and relentlessly intense, is as much an entrepreneur as he is an engineer. At 16 he started a web design firm that a former colleague says made him a millionaire by the end of high school. (Levandowski didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.) As a University of California at Berkeley undergraduate, he won a national competition sponsored by Lego—he built a toy robot that could sort Monopoly money. Levandowski was 22 and working toward an MBA and an industrial engineering master’s at Berkeley when he first heard about the Darpa Grand Challenge. (His mother read about it and mentioned it to him.) The 2004 competition, organized by the U.S. Department of Defense, involved a race for robotic cars on a 150-mile course in the Mojave Desert. It drew teams from Carnegie Mellon, the California Institute of Technology, a number of defense contractors, and most of the other big names in robotics. Levandowski led a ragtag team of Berkeley graduate students and research assistants. If there was hubris in entering, there was even more in his chosen design. Ghostrider, his self-balancing, self-driving motorcycle, was the only two-wheel vehicle in the contest. “I was assuming the driving part would be easy to solve,” he said last summer, speaking to Bloomberg Businessweek in a joint interview with Kalanick shortly before Uber announced its acquisition of Otto. “I wanted to make something actually difficult.” Although it failed to stay upright on race day—a grainy YouTube video documenting Ghostrider’s run is six seconds long—the bike was still seen as an achievement by Levandowski’s peers, partly because no team finished. (Ghostrider eventually became part of the Smithsonian’s permanent collection.) For the next competition, in 2005, Levandowski served as the team leader for Ghostrider while also working on lidar sensors for the winning team from Stanford, which was managed by Thrun. Levandowski and two Berkeley friends adapted the technology from Ghostrider, which had used GPS and cheap digital cameras, into a commercial product. Their company, 510 Systems LLC, sold camera systems, and eventually lidar, to mapping companies, including Nokia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. Levandowski also sold kits to automate agricultural and construction equipment. In 2007, Google hired Thrun’s team from Stanford to work on a new product, Street View, formally making Levandowski a full-time employee of the search company even as he continued to run 510. The initial plan was to supplement Google’s maps, which at the time used data licensed from the mapping giant Navteq Corp., with pictures of city streets. Levandowski suggested that Thrun’s mapping technology could allow Google to replace Navteq’s data altogether. His mapping initiative was seen as an enormous success, allowing Google to offer on phones turn-by-turn driving directions that were as good as those offered by standalone GPS device makers. In 2008, while doing double-duty at Google and 510, he took a call from a producer at the Discovery Channel who wanted to borrow Ghostrider for an episode of Prototype This!, a short-lived documentary series. Levandowski suggested instead that he use a different vehicle. He asked Google for permission to embark on the stunt using sensors similar to those on Google’s mapping cars. It was granted on the condition that Levandowski, and not Google, would be responsible if something went wrong. “The lawyers said, ‘Absolutely, but please don’t put Google on the side,’?” Levandowski told Bloomberg Businessweek in the interview last summer. “So we started this thing called Anthony’s Robots to be very clear it wasn’t Google-related.” A few weeks later, under a police escort and with cameras rolling, the Pribot, as Pribot, as Levandowski named his converted Toyota Prius, successfully crossed the San Francisco Bay Bridge.Prius, successfully crossed the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Google’s self-driving car project began the following year with a modified Prius that used software created by Prius that used software created by Thrun at Stanford and hardware supplied by Anthony’s Robots. Like 510 Systems, Anthony’s Robots was operated as an independent company. The arrangement—whereby Levandowski was at once a founding member of the Google self-driving car team and a vendor who was also selling technology to other companies—was well-known to Google executives, though it was never publicly disclosed. “Anthony is a rogue force of nature,” says a former Google self-driving car executive. “Each phase of his Google career he had a separate company doing exactly the same work.” According to two former Google employees, founders Page and Sergey Brin tolerated Brin tolerated Levandowski’s freelancing because they saw it as the fastest way to make progress. Google’s car team embraced Levandowski’s nature, too. The attitude, says a former colleague, was “he’s an asshole, but he’s our asshole.” As Google’s car project grew, a debate raged inside the company, reflecting a broader dispute about the direction of autonomous vehicles: Should the tech come gradually and be added to cars with drivers (through features like automatic parking and highway autopilot) or all at once (for instance, a fleet of fully autonomous cars operating in a city center)? Urmson, a former Carnegie Mellon professor, preferred the latter approach, arguing that incremental innovations might, paradoxically, make cars less safe. Levandowski believed otherwise and argued that Google should sell self-driving kits that could be retrofitted on cars, former colleagues say. Urmson won out, and according to two former employees, Levandowski sulked openly. After one dispute between the two, Levandowski stopped coming to work for months, devoting his time to his side projects. This didn’t stop Page and Brin from discreetly acquiring 510 Systems and Anthony’s Robots for roughly $50 million in 2011.Brin from discreetly acquiring 510 Systems and Anthony’s Robots for roughly $50 million in 2011. As Google’s driverless car program matured, Levandowski seemed to become impatient. Creating a fully functioning driverless car means training a complicated hardware and software system to identify lane lines and red lights and to control the car’s movements. It also means writing software that anticipates thousands of unlikely “edge cases”—hairpin turns, drivers who use hand signals, covered bridges, recumbent bikes, and so on. That work seemed to bore Levandowski. He became increasingly frustrated at Google’s inability to operate its cars on city streets and decided to take matters into his own hands. “Engineers were like, ‘We are totally ready to go,’ and I’m like, ‘Let’s go then. Let’s see whether it’s real or a demo,’?” Levandowski said in the summer interview. Without formally telling Google, which considered its cars not yet ready for open-road tests, he hired a lobbyist in Nevada and wrote a law that allowed companies to test autonomous cars with so-called safety drivers. (Self-driving car companies use the term to describe an engineer who sits in the driver’s seat with her hands on the wheel in case the car malfunctions.) The law passed at the end of 2011, though Google hasn’t conducted large-scale tests in the state. Google’s government relations department learned about Levandowski’s Nevada efforts when the lobbyist, David Goldwater, sent the company an invoice. Levandowski first met Kalanick in 2011 at a TED conference, but the two didn’t become close until early 2016, after Levandowski pitched Kalanick on an investment in Otto. Kalanick didn’t invest—but he did begin meeting with Levandowski in secret. In the interview with Bloomberg Businessweek at the time of the acquisition, Kalanick described these rendezvous in detail: The two would go to the San Francisco Ferry Building after sunset, entering separately and each picking up takeout food. They’d begin walking west toward the Golden Gate Bridge, where they’d eventually join up and begin talking. Kalanick recalled that he and Levandowski went on five or so of these walks, each one lasting several hours. Kalanick, now 40, was taken by the younger man’s hustle and sense of purpose, describing him as a “brother from another mother.” To get self-driving cars to production, Kalanick said in the interview, “it can’t just be about science. It has to be about engineering and entrepreneurialism that takes us into the real world. That’s where Anthony and I connect, right?”entrepreneurialism that takes us into the real world. That’s where Anthony and I connect, right?” Levandowski, who was sitting next to him, nodded. “We think very similarly in terms of how do we get things out onto the world fastest,” he said. “How do we make a difference, how do we make impact, how do we get people using our technology.” Levandowski hinted that he’d decided to break with Google and start Otto in part out of frustration at the slow pace of innovation at Google. That might not have been the whole story. On March 10, Google, which is seeking a preliminary injunction to stop Uber from using its technology, filed written testimony from Pierre-Yves Droz, Droz, Levandowski’s co-founder at 510 Systems and the technical lead on Google’s lidar program. Droz wrote that in the summer of 2015 Droz wrote that in the summer of 2015 Levandowski said Uber might be interested in “buying the team” and that in January 2016 he told Droz he would “replicate” the company’s Droz he would “replicate” the company’s lidar. When Levandowski quit to start Otto, he was escorted out by Google security. A handful of Google employees soon followed him to the new company. Soon after, Levandowski began making trips to Uber’s self-driving car research center in Pittsburgh, where a staff that had grown to 500 was scrambling to launch the pilot taxi service. Levandowski wasn’t widely introduced; senior managers believed he was a consultant. “As far as the team knew,” says a former employee, Levandowski was “some guy who would come around and be annoying.” At Otto’s San Francisco headquarters, the startup, which had 90 or so employees, prepared for its product launch in May. Down a stretch of Nevada highway, the company ran a self-driving big-rig truck kitted out with sensors and computer controllers. Documents uncovered by the tech publication Backchannel showed that Levandowksi had sought the approval of state regulators to film the demo. When they denied his request to do the run, he went through with it anyway. (Goldwater, again serving as kitted out with sensors and computer controllers. Documents uncovered by the tech publication Backchannel showed that Levandowksi had sought the approval of state regulators to film the demo. When they denied his request to do the run, he went through with it anyway. (Goldwater, again serving as Levandowski’s lobbyist, argued in an email to the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles that it had no jurisdiction in the matter. A senior DMV administrator called the test “illegal” in an internal email but declined to rebuke Otto publicly.) In August, Uber acquired Otto for roughly $700 million in company stock. The plan, Kalanick said, was to continue building Otto’s trucking business and to use the startup’s homegrown lidar to beef up Uber’s own self-driving cars, all under Levandowski’s supervision. Uber’s Pittsburgh team learned of the acquisition, and the fact that they had a new boss, the day it was announced. “The team was super unhappy,” says a former employee. It turned out that Otto’s lidar was a work in progress—the company’s prototype trucks were still using sensors manufactured by Velodyne Velodyne Lidar Inc. “We thought we were getting some supersecret sauce by joining them,” says the employee. “But they did smoke and mirrors and got a huge acquisition offer.” Over the next six months, about 15 of the original 40 Carnegie Mellon engineers left. At least three have subsequently founded competing self-driving car companies, one of which recently received a $1 billion investment over five years from Ford Motor Co.supersecret sauce by joining them,” says the employee. “But they did smoke and mirrors and got a huge acquisition offer.” Over the next six months, about 15 of the original 40 Carnegie Mellon engineers left. At least three have subsequently founded competing self-driving car companies, one of which recently received a $1 billion investment over five years from Ford Motor Co. Levandowski seemed to struggle in other ways as well. In December, Uber dispatched 16 self-driving cars, with safety drivers, in San Francisco without seeking a permit from the California DMV. The test went poorly—on the first day, a self-driving car ran a red light, and the DMV ordered Uber to halt its program in the state. The company suffered further embarrassment when a New York Times article, citing leaked documents, suggested that Uber’s explanation for the traffic violation—that it had been caused by human error—wasn’t complete. The car malfunctioned, and the driver failed to stop it. The misdirection came as no surprise to the Uber employees who’d spent time at Otto’s San Francisco headquarters. Someone there had distributed stickers—in OSHA orange—with a tongue-in-cheek slogan: “Safety third.” In Silicon Valley, litigation is looked upon as the last refuge of the undisruptiveundisruptive Uber has yet to file a legal response to Google’s complaint—a spokeswoman says it plans to do so later this month—but the company essentially has two options: It can settle with Waymo and license its sensors, or it can fight. “What Waymo probably wants is to license its patents to Uber,” says Robert Gomulkiewicz, a former Microsoft intellectual-property lawyer who’s now a professor at the University of Washington School of Law. “In this kind of litigation, that’s the typical sequence of events.”Gomulkiewicz, a former Microsoft intellectual-property lawyer who’s now a professor at the University of Washington School of Law. “In this kind of litigation, that’s the typical sequence of events.” That said, this isn’t a typical patent dispute, and Uber isn’t a typical company. If it fights, it could argue, as Levandowski did at the all-hands meeting in Pittsburgh, that the alleged document dump was simply part of an effort on his part to work from home. It could also cite how Google seemed to encourage Levandowski’s freelance excursions. And while many of his former colleagues assume that Google wouldn’t sue Levandowski if the forensic evidence wasn’t incontrovertible—that is, if it didn’t have him dead to rights—other former colleagues and some industry insiders see the lawsuit as evidence that Google is struggling to make up for its failure to bring a product to market quickly. “Google is the Xerox Parc of self-driving cars,” says George Hotz, the founder of Comma.ai, another autonomous car startup. It’s a backhanded compliment: Although Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center invented the modern computer operating system, it didn’t bring the invention to market; Apple Inc. did. “The real question is, why hasn’t Google shipped?” Hotz asks. He regards Google’s lawsuit as a deliberate conflation of two different beefs.

Whatever Levandowski did with Google’s files, he’s not wrong that Google has struggled to commercialize technology that’s widely regarded as the best in the automotive industry. Before Google worked on its current prototype, a two-seater that has a top speed of 20 miles per hour and vaguely resembles a koala bear, the company pitched Elon Musk on outfitting his electric Tesla vehicles with Google tech, according to two people familiar with the deal. Musk passed and a few years later launched Tesla Inc.’s highway autopilot service on his own. A former Google executive says John Krafcik, who joined the car project as CEO in 2015, would sometimes appear rattled by the competitive moves of Tesla and Uber, wondering aloud if Google may have already been “leapfrogged.” He would grow particularly irritable “every time Elon would post something on Twitter,” the executive says. Levandowski hasn’t shown any sign of being rattled or contrite. Three days after the lawsuit hit, he appeared onstage in Barcelona as a marquee speaker at the Mobile World Congress. The lawsuit never came up. As a final question, the moderator, the chief marketing officer of a cell phone industry trade group, simply asked, “Do you drive?” Levandowski smiled. “Sometimes I drive, and sometimes I’m driven,” he said. “That’s the beauty of being able to work on this project—you get to see the technology evolve and get better over time.” “Absolutely fascinating stuff,” the moderator replied. “Please, everyone: a round of applause for Anthony.” The crowd, stacked with top executives from the world’s biggest companies, complied enthusiastically.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Google Assistant is not coming to tablets, says company Google Assistant is not coming to tablets, says company Google is restricting the Assistant to just smartphones for now, with tablets being left out By: Tech Desk | Published:March 18, 2017 1:03 pm Google Assistant will be restricted to smartphones for now. Google Assistant has moved beyond the Pixel smartphones, and if your phone is running Android 7.0 Nougat and above versions or Android Marshmallow you should have the virtual assistant on your device. But it looks like Google is restricting the Assistant to just smartphones for now. In a statement to Android Police, Google confirmed: the Assistant is not coming to tablets just yet, which is strange. The statement reads, “The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play Services, this does not include tablets.” It’s not clear why Google has decided to restrict Assistant to just smartphones, but this could change later on. After all, Google Assistant was supposed to be exclusive to the Pixel smartphones, when they were first launched in October 2016, but all that has changed since then. Google Assistant got into a bit of trouble earlier this week as well, after users of the Google Home speaker reported about an ad for ‘Beauty and the Beast’ was played by the device at the end of weather updates. Google in a statement to The Verge denied the audio was an ad, but admitted it should have handled this better. Google’s statement reads, “This wasn’t intended to be an ad. What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case.” But then another user pointed out the ad was also playing on the Google Assistant on the Nexus 5X. For now, it looks like Google has pulled the ad. Ad or no ad, Google Assistant is viewed as the way forward for search and interactions on smartphones. So it is strange that the AI is not coming to Android tablets, which are still used by many customers. Google Assistant will also see enhanced third-party support in 2017; Google opened up the API for this last year. It means the Assistant will soon lets users book an Uber or order food from a restaurant via a supporting app. Other OEMs like Samsung, HTC are planning to add their own smart assistant to phones. Lenovo-owned Motorola already announced the Amazon Alexa, voice-assistant will be coming to its phones this year.

By Kedar Grandhi March 18, 2017 07:23 GMT This withdrawal is amid Youtube displaying ads of many brands next to content promoting extremismReuters French multinational advertising and PR firm Havas pulled out its entire UK digital ad spending from Google and YouTube on Friday, 17 March. The company confirmed the same, but said this withdrawal would be limited to its UK business. This follows a similar withdrawal from many major UK brands and the UK government departments. They withdrew their advertisements after discovering it was appearing next to content promoting extremism. Paul Frampton, Havas UK chief executive and country manager, was quoted as saying by the Guardian: "We have a duty of care to our clients in the UK marketplace to position their brands in the right context where we can be assured that that environment is safe, regulated to the degree necessary and additive to their brands' objectives." "Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network's ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect," he added. Ads of the Home Office, the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, Transport For London, Argos and Sainsbury's among many others were found to be being displayed alongside videos for racists, white supremacists, rape apologists and other such videos that advocate extremism. Following this, many brands and the UK Government said they would withdraw their ads from the Google platforms until the American tech giant would take necessary action to resolve the same. Havas is one of the world's biggest marketing agency whose annual digital spend in the UK alone stands at about £175m ($217m). A few news reports had said recently that Havas would consider a global freeze on YouTube and Google ads. However, according to the latest from a Havas spokeswoman, the rest of the group will not withdraw its ads from either of the two platforms. "The decision of our UK team to pause activity with our partner Google is a temporary move made by the local team on behalf of our UK clients and their specific needs. We are working with Google to resolve the issues so that we can return to using this valuable platform in the UK," she was quoted as saying by Reuters. Meanwhile, Yannick Bollore CEO at Havas tweeted he was not even aware of its British unit's decision. Google on its part has already publicly apologised for this issue. It said it had worked hard to prevent ads from appearing on pages or videos with "hate speech, gory or offensive content". It added that it would launch a review to give brands who advertise on its platform more control over where their ads should appear.

The US company said in a blog post yesterday it would give clients more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites. The announcement came after the UK government and the Guardian newspaper pulled ads from the video site, stepping up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform. France’s Havas SA, the world’s sixth-largest advertising and marketing company, pulled its UK clients’ ads from Google and YouTube yesterday after failing to get assurances from Google that the ads wouldn’t appear next to offensive material. Those clients include wireless carrier O2, Royal Mail Plc, government-owned British Broadcasting Corp, Domino’s Pizza and Hyundai Kia, Havas said in a statement. “Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network’s ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect," said Paul Frampton, chief executive officer and country manager for Havas Media Group UK. Later, the parent company Havas said it would not take any action outside the UK, and called its UK unit’s decision “a temporary move.” “The Havas Group will not be undertaking such measures on a global basis,” a Havas spokeswoman wrote in an email. “We are working with Google to resolve the issues so that we can return to using this valuable platform in the UK.” The decision to pull ads from Google followed a Times of London investigation that revealed ads from many large companies and the UK government appeared alongside content from the likes of white nationalist David Duke and pastor Steven Anderson, who praised the killing of 49 people in a gay nightclub. Google made US$7.8 billion (RM34.6 billion) in advertising revenue in the UK in 2016, accounting for 8.6 per cent of the company’s total sales. The boycott signals a growing backlash against so-called programmatic trading, which automates the buying and selling of advertising online, and social media providers that are seen to not be doing enough to tackle hate disseminated on their platforms. Online clash Media-buying firms are also increasingly resentful of the power wielded by Google and Facebook Inc, claiming the two companies operate a global duopoly over online advertising. The controversy about ads appearing in inappropriate contexts may give these media buyers leverage in negotiations with the social media giants. Martin Sorrell, the founder and chief executive officer of WPP, the global advertising firm, said in a statement that Google and Facebook have “the same responsibilities as any media company” and could not “masquerade” as mere technology platforms. He said WPP’s GroupM, a major ad buyer, was talking to Google “at the highest levels to encourage them to find answers to these brand safety issues.” Ronan Harris, Google’s UK managing director, said in the blog post that Google removed nearly two billion offensive ads from its platforms last year and also blacklisted 100,000 publishers from the company’s ad sense programme. Despite this, Harris wrote, “we don’t always get it right.” Harris said Google had “heard from our advertisers loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content.” Policy review The company will now review its policies and said it would be making changes “in the coming weeks” to help customers stop their ads appearing on objectionable websites or against offensive videos, Harris said.

(Source: Bloomberg) Google, the primary revenue driver for Alphabet Inc., announced changes to its advertising policies after major brands pulled ads from the platform because they appeared alongside offensive content, such as videos promoting terrorism or anti-Semitism. The U.S. company said in a blog post Friday it would give clients more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites. The announcement came after the UK government and the Guardian newspaper pulled ads from the video site, stepping up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform. France’s Havas SA, the world’s sixth-largest advertising and marketing company, pulled its U.K. clients’ ads from Google and YouTube on Friday after failing to get assurances from Google that the ads wouldn’t appear next to offensive material. Those clients include wireless carrier O2, Royal Mail Plc, government-owned British Broadcasting Corp., Domino’s Pizza and Hyundai Kia, Havas said in a statement. Also Read: YouTube announces its live streaming service to take on cable TV “Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network’s ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect,” said Paul Frampton, chief executive officer and country manager for Havas Media Group UK. Later, the parent company Havas said it would not take any action outside the UK, and called its UK unit’s decision “a temporary move.” “The Havas Group will not be undertaking such measures on a global basis,” a Havas spokeswoman wrote in an email. “We are working with Google to resolve the issues so that we can return to using this valuable platform in the UK.” The decision to pull ads from Google followed a Times of London investigation that revealed ads from many large companies and the UK government appeared alongside content from the likes of white nationalist David Duke and pastor Steven Anderson, who praised the killing of 49 people in a gay nightclub.

Tyler Lizenby/CNET Smart Home by Taylor Martin March 14, 2017 6:00 AM PDT @caspertek Top 5 things Amazon's Alexa can do that Google Home can't Amazon's head start in the smart speaker market makes Alexa hard to beat. by Iyaz Akhtar 1:32 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF While Google Home can do a lot that the Echo can't -- like contextual conversations or throwing images and videos to your televisions -- it has plenty of catching-up to do with Amazon Echo's Alexa. Google is always adding new features to Home, so that list continues to shrink, but there are still seven things we wish it could do. One technical note: Throughout this piece, Google Assistant is often compared to Amazon Alexa, as those are the voice-assistance technologies within these devices. Just remember that the way Google Assistant works on Google Home is much more limited than the way it works on phones. 49 Here's everything the Amazon Echo can do Track packages Since you can order items using Alexa, it only makes sense that you can track orders placed through Amazon with Alexa, as well. All you have to say is, "Alexa, where's my stuff?" She won't give you a ton of details, like where the package currently is or the status of the shipment, but she will tell you the day it's estimated to arrive. Seeing as this is a feature already integrated into Google Assistant on phones, it's likely only a matter of time before Google Home can also track orders placed with practically any online retailer. But there is no mention of package tracking in the long list of features of Google Home. If you ask Google Home to track your package today, she'll just say, "I can't do that yet." Yet! Amazon Music and Prime Music Chris Monroe/CNET The music and radio services officially supported by Google Home at launch were Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora and TuneIn. Support for iHeartRadio was rolled out at the end of February. With Amazon's Alexa speakers, you get support for the same music services, save for Google Play Music and YouTube Music. Instead, you get support for Amazon's in-house streaming services, Amazon Music and Prime Music. Despite not officially supporting Amazon Music or Prime Music -- which isn't all that surprising given they are competitors -- you can stream almost any audio to Google Home by casting from a phone or tablet. The Amazon Music app does not support Chromecast, however, so you can't stream audio from the app to Google Home using an iOS device. However, there is a workaround for Android devices. Begin playing music from within the Amazon Music app, pull down the notification shade, tap the Cast logo, and select your Google Home from the list to stream the audio through the speaker. Read books out loud One of Alexa's greatest features is the ability to play audiobooks from Audible or read your Kindle books, simply by asking. Say, "Alexa, play 'A Walk in the Woods'" or "Alexa, read 'Ready Player One.'" Google Home doesn't come with any official support for playing audiobooks or reading e-books (not surprising considering the companies are competitors), which is unfortunate and surprising, especially considering the built-in Read Aloud feature in Google Play Books. Of course, while you can't queue up an audiobook or have Google Home read an e-book with a voice command, you can use the same workaround mentioned above to stream the audio through the Google Home speaker. Play the audiobook or select Read Aloud in the Google Play Books app, pull down the notification shade, tap the Cast icon and select your Google Home speaker to begin streaming the audio. Still, this doesn't work with Kindle books. You will have had to have purchased the book from Google to stream the Read Aloud feature to Google Home, which might fragment your digital library. Multiple designs Unless you have an Android phone that supports Google Assistant, Google Home is the only way you can bring Assistant into your household. Chris Monroe/CNET Since the launch of Echo, Amazon has added smaller and more portable options to its lineup. The Echo Dot is a cheaper, low-profile way to add more Alexa to your house; the Tap lets you take Alexa on the go -- no wires needed. As mentioned, we suspect Google will allow other speaker-makers build Assistant into their devices. But until one hits the market, Amazon has the advantage when it comes to giving you multiple design options. Voice remote Sarah Tew/CNET If you just want to be able to control your Echo from out of typical voice range, all you need is an Alexa Voice Remote for $30. To accomplish the same thing with Google Home, you will need to add a second Google Home for $129 a pop (currently only available in the US, that directly converts to about £106, AU$171). Third-party apps CNET Amazon lets developers harness the power of Alexa within applications, such as Roger and Ubi. One developer created an online tool -- called Echosim.io -- so developers can test their skills without needing to own the hardware. As a plus, now anyone can take Alexa for a test drive in their browser. Aside from streaming audio, these virtual versions of Alexa work exactly the same as the official devices from Amazon, meaning you can get the full effect of Alexa before ever having to spend a dime on Amazon's speakers. For now, the best way to test Google Home is by using Google Assistant on a compatible Android phone. DIY Alexa In March of 2016, Amazon released an API for Alexa Voice Service (AVS), the service which powers the Amazon Echo, Echo Dot and Amazon Tap. This allowed developers and users to put Alexa on custom hardware, like Raspberry Pi. It also allows third-party manufacturers to build their own Alexa speakers (or Alexa-powered computers.) So, if you don't like Amazon's speakers, there are third-party or homebrew options to choose from, like the Matrix Creator, an add-on board for Raspberry Pi. Editors' note: This article was updated March 13, 2017 to update information regarding new Google Home features and Google Assistant availability. Previously included in this list were Alexa skills, voice shopping and official iHeartRadio support. The ability for Alexa to read Kindle books was also added.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach The Samsung Galaxy S8, Google Pixel 2 and OnePlus 5 are three highly-anticipated devices of this year, and all three will undoubtedly pack some amazing specs and features that can create a rage in the market. Various reports have tried to speculate about the configuration these devices will come with. There have been a plethora of leaks, most of the Galaxy S8 smartphone. If one is open to choosing a great mobile and is not a brand loyalist, here’s a comparison of the possible specs these mobile phones will sport. OnePlus broke into the competitive smartphone scene by primarily releasing pocket-friendly flagships. Recent leaks have revealed that the company will be coming up with the OnePlus 5 handset this year. Google has also confirmed at the MWC 2017 that the Pixel 2 is on the way. There are talks that the OnePlus flagship will come with a 5.5-inch dual-curved edge AMOLED display, like the one in Galaxy S7 Edge. A 1440p QHD resolution is a big possibility though the exact display details are not yet available. The Galaxy and OnePlus sets will run on Android 7.0 Nougat and pack the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset. For the global markets, Samsung may release an Exynos 8995 SoC variant. The OnePlus handset may come with a 6GB or 8GB RAM, bigger than the other two. There are also rumours that the OnePlus phone will have a 16MP selfie camera and a 23MP primary camera. It will run on Android 7.0 Nougat OS and may pack a 4,000 mAh battery. It will have USB Type-C connectivity, glass and aluminium body and 64GB internal memory, writes AndroidPit. The Galaxy S8 and Pixel 2 will also run on the Nougat OS. Both the phones may use either AMOLED or Super-AMOLED displays. The Samsung flagship will also be released with an Exynos 8895 processor, and may boast 4-6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage. The Google Pixel 2 will also likely get the Snapdragon 835 boost. The Galaxy handsets will come with 5.1-inch and 6.2-inch curved displays that will also boast QHD+ resolution. The Samsung smartphones are said to be dropping the physical Home button and shifting the fingerprint scanner to the rear. They will have a higher screen-to-body ration than their predecessors. The phones may also feature 4GB RAM. The Pixel 2 handset will also likely come with 18:9 QHD+ Display.

It’s been another exciting week across the tech world, with no end of exciting news keeping us on our toes. But if you’ve struggled to keep with it all, fear not, for 7 Days is here once more with a handy walkthrough of the week’s top tech news. "Laser beam" Our journey begins this week on a beam of light, as researchers at the University of Michigan revealed significant progress in development efforts for “lightwave” computers, relying on ultra-fast laser impulses to get electrons firing at incredible speeds. Their discoveries could pave the way towards creating quantum computing devices. Amazon announced that it’s bringing support for its Alexa digital assistant to iPhones – but oddly, not in the Alexa app. Instead, the functionality is being added to the Amazon app on iOS devices. On Thursday, Apple released the seventh betas of iOS 10.3 and macOS 10.12.4 Sierra, both for developers, and testers on its Public Beta program. A passenger on a flight to Melbourne, Australia suffered injuries when her wireless headphones ‘exploded’ on board. The incident raised fresh concerns over battery-powered consumer devices on airliners, following the ban on Samsung’s Galaxy Note7 on flights last year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke with Australia's Prime Minister, offering energy storage solutions and reliable supplies to solve recent electricity shortage issues that left 40,000 people without power in South Australia. But domestic energy suppliers criticized the government for even considering Musk’s offer, calling for a “transparent bid process” and a level playing field to give Australian companies “a fair go”. Over in the UK, telecommunications giant BT agreed to spin off its Openreach network division into a separate company that will provide rivals with access to its domestic network. Rivals such as Virgin Media mocked the move, claiming that it will make little difference to BT’s competitors and to UK customers, as Openreach will continue to offer “the same old snail’s paced network with a new shell”. In Russia, Apple was found guilty of price-fixing after regulators determined that it was compelling companies to sell many of its iPhones at a minimum retail price, stifling competition in the domestic market. Several Russians were among those alleged to have been involved in major digital attacks against Yahoo, which compromised hundreds of millions of user accounts. Image: Getty Images for Visa Visa is considering launching - or at least supporting - wearable devices with support for mobile payments – but rather than going down the ‘typical’ route of wristbands, it’s instead trialling sunglasses with NFC support. On Friday, Qualcomm announced that its processors will now be known as ‘platforms’, and that it's ditching the Snapdragon branding from its current Snapdragon 200-series chips, which will now be branded under the ‘Qualcomm Mobile’ moniker. Meanwhile, rival chipmaker Intel stunned the markets by announcing its $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli company that focuses on developing technology for autonomous vehicles. The purchase is a hugely significant move for Intel, giving it a huge boost in the technology behind self-driving cars. Intel was also a key partner in the launch of Tag Heuer’s new Connected Modular 45 smartwatch, an Android Wear 2.0 device with a diverse ecosystem of modular accessories. Promising more than a day of power, along with water resistance, the new device also comes with a hefty price tag: you’ll need to hand over $1,600 to own one. Google has developed a new system to replace the infuriating CAPTCHA tool, which features on many websites that demand that you prove that you’re “not a robot”. The "invisible reCAPTCHA" system works in the background and uses magic and witchcraft "an advanced risk analysis engine" to determine that real humans are accessing websites. Meanwhile, the latest version of Chrome’s web browser brings massive improvements in power usage for PCs, as well as introducing a new offline reading mode to iOS. Google also updated its Gmail app on Android allowing users to send and request money, just as easily as sharing an attachment. Impressively, the company says that the feature is "completely free" for both senders and recipients. Sony’s new ultra-thin Android TV, the Bravia OLED 4K HDR TV, finally got a launch date and official price tag this week – but you’ll need to be earning some serious dough to be able to afford one. Samsung also announced details of its new QLED TVs this week, featuring ‘Quantum Dot’ technology, with the 55-inch models starting at almost half the price of Sony’s 55-inch OLED TVs. Those who pre-order LG’s impressive new G6 flagship in the United States will get a free Google Home speaker hub worth $129.99 with the device. T-Mobile will be offering the new phone in the US, and announced its pricing this week. Google Home is powered by the Google Assistant – but it hasn’t been a great month for the digital assistant so far. After spewing loony conspiracy theories last week, Google Assistant unexpectedly threw in ads for Disney’s new Beauty and the Beast movie a few days ago. However, Google later insisted that the ads weren’t ads at all, but rather “timely content”. And after announcing wider availability of the Assistant on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and 7.0 Nougat devices last month, Google confirmed this week that it won’t be supported on any Android tablets. Nougat is currently installed on just 2.8% of active Android devices. Google is believed to be planning to release the newest version of the OS, Android 7.1.2, on April 3 – but for now, its long, slow rollout continues to more handsets: T-Mobile is now testing Nougat for the HTC One M9 OnePlus brings Android 7.1.1 to the 3 and 3T Google Nexus 6 owners on Android 7.1.1 get over-the-air ‘downgrade’ to Android 7.0, causing all sorts of issues on their devices Nougat heads to Samsung’s Galaxy S6 and S6 in India Samsung begins Android 7.0 rollout to Galaxy Note5 Earlier this month, Google released its latest monthly Android security updates. Some manufacturers have begun distributing the March patches quickly – but others have not: March security updates now available for Sony’s Xperia X, X Performance, X Compact and XZ AT&T brings February security updates to Samsung Galaxy Note5, Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S5 active Samsung (re)commits to monthly security updates for unlocked Galaxy smartphones in the US HMD says it will deliver monthly Android patches to the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 ZTE finally gets around to bringing January updates to its Blade V8 Pro, which was released in February The need for timely security updates was highlighted again this week with yet more Android malware having been discovered. Disturbingly, security researchers at Check Point found that malware had been pre-installed on 38 devices, including some from major manufacturers such as ZTE, Samsung, Lenovo, Xiaomi and ASUS. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+ will be unveiled later this month, but there may not be much left for the company to announce by then. More details on the new flagships emerged this week: Images leak of Samsung Experience launcher ‘Black Pearl’ model revealed Galaxy S8 might have camera capable of capturing 1000 frames per second China expected to get exclusive S8 model with 6GB RAM Time ran out to develop the Galaxy S8’s on-screen fingerprint scanner Pricing of the new Galaxy Tab S3 was also revealed this week in the UK and US – but the new high-end tablet, which has a Snapdragon 820 chip – won’t come cheap. Also in the UK, Sony’s Xperia XZ Premium, which it unveiled at Mobile World Congress last month, has been priced at £649. After increasing the price of its Windows 10 Mobile flagship in the UK by 7% last week, HP is hoping to tempt people to buy the Elite x3 and Desk Dock by offering them up to £500 to trade in their existing handsets. Unfortunately, owners of Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile flagships will only get £125 for their devices. Meanwhile, Microsoft cut the price of the Elite x3 and Desk Dock this week… by 2.4%. Can’t see that making a big difference in boosting sales. Sales of Windows phones have plummeted over the last two years. Industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel wrote off Microsoft’s mobile OS this week, declaring that there’s no hope for a comeback, and that we’re now living in a “two-OS world” as far as the mobile industry goes. Microsoft gave in to that reality a long time ago, bringing more of its software to rival platforms in recent years. It’s made huge improvements to its Arrow Launcher for Android devices over the last few months, adding new support for Android tablets this week. There’s now less than a month until Microsoft ends support for Windows Vista, including security updates. Microsoft has also apparently begun blocking software updates for older versions of Windows running on the newest hardware. Some Windows 7 and 8.1 updates aren’t being offered to PCs running Intel’s latest Kaby Lake (7th-generation) Core processors, along with other new-gen chips, as Microsoft is trying to force encourage users to upgrade to Windows 10. At the same time, Microsoft is now preparing to push through certain Windows 10 updates to devices over metered connections. The company says that it will only do so for “critical fixes” and other “updates required to keep Windows running smoothly”. Microsoft has begun the process of finalizing its Windows 10 Creators Update, ahead of its anticipated release in April. The next step for the company is to select a release candidate which is likely to be distributed to Windows Insiders next week. Microsoft detailed new security improvements in the Creators Update this week, but it also revealed details of features being removed from Windows 10 as part of that update. It’s been a busy week for Windows 10 development, as three new builds rolled out to the Fast ring: 15058, 15060, and on Friday, build 15061. You can find details of the fixes and known issues in build 15061 here. The latest Windows 10 SDK Preview, build 15052, is also available, along with ISOs for build 15058. The latter build is now available on the Windows Insider Slow ring too. Microsoft hasn't yet announced a firm date for the Creators Update's release, so there's plenty of room for speculation! Microsoft released its latest cumulative updates for all versions of Windows 10 on Tuesday, including build 10240.17319 (Version 1507 – the original release of the OS), 10586.839 (Version 1511 – the November Update), and 14393.953 (Version 1607 – the Anniversary Update). However, the latest update for Windows 10 Mobile devices did not include a fix for a rather unpleasant bug that leaves all users’ photos available to view without unlocking a handset. That bug was revealed over a month ago, and yet Microsoft still hasn’t resolved the issue – we checked! Microsoft did fix nine critical security issues in Windows 10 with its latest Patch Tuesday updates though. We don’t yet know exactly when Microsoft plans to announce its second-generation Surface Book, but the device is certainly ripe for replacement. It went on sale almost a year and a half ago, but there are plenty of newer and more capable alternatives available now, including some at lower prices. This week, a report claimed that the new Surface Book 2 will have a more ‘traditional’ laptop form factor, ditching the detachable display of the current model, and thus helping to reduce the cost of the entry-level model by as much as a third, bringing its price down to as little as $1,000. The thing is, that doesn’t make a great deal of sense unless Microsoft plans to differentiate the Surface Book 2 in some other remarkable new way. Surface has always been dedicated to developing new product categories to lead the way for other manufacturers to follow with their own devices. Competing head-on with existing machines by launching a ‘conventional’ notebook would go against the Surface ethos, and would likely do little to help sales of similar laptops from Microsoft’s hardware partners. Over in the UK, Microsoft is continuing to soften the blow of its recent – and massive – price increases on the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 by extending its offer of free insurance and Office 365, along with new discounts on both devices. The total savings amount to as much as £600. Microsoft has been working with researchers in the UK on a remarkable project, helping visually impaired children to learn coding by using physical, tangible objects. And after several months in preview, Microsoft officially launched its Slack competitor, Teams, in 19 languages and 181 countries across the globe. Microsoft brought its OneDrive app, developed on the Universal Windows Platform, to the Xbox One this week. It also released Xbox Insider Preview build 15058 to the Alpha ring on Friday, bring a new feature along with a single fix, and a long list of known issues. It followed the release of build 15055 to the Alpha ring earlier in the week. Microsoft also revealed that its Alpha Preview of the new Xbox Game Pass will end on April 7. Game Pass is a monthly $10 subscription that will give gamers access to over 100 games, and will launch this Spring. For the first time in two weeks, Microsoft added four more titles to the list of Xbox 360 games that are backward compatible with the Xbox One. It also introduced a new in-game chat transcription feature for the Xbox One and Windows 10, with speech-to-text and text-to-speech support. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission announced a recall of Energizer’s Xbox One 2X Smart Charger, following reports of potentially dangerous overheating on some units. And after releasing its 4.50 system software update for the PlayStation 4 family last week, some owners of Sony’s consoles have reported issues being able to connect to wireless networks. In happier news, Sony announced that it’s expanding its PlayStation Now service to include PS4 games, allowing PC gamers to enjoy those titles on their Windows machines. Nintendo brought a range of indie titles to its new Switch console, which launched earlier this month. But it also emerged that the Switch is vulnerable to a WebKit exploit, demonstrated through a proof-of-concept earlier this week.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Israeli tech firms revving up engines for self-driving cars Israeli tech firms revving up engines for self-driving cars As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. By: AP | Published:March 18, 2017 11:26 am Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. ( Source: Mobileye) As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from sensors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. “In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more,” said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. “Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye.” Also Read: Intel to buy Mobileye for about $15 Billion in car tech push She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister’s Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel’s only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is “ripe for change.” He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. Founders of Mobileye present at the Prime Minister’s office at Jerusalem. (Source: AP) He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. “What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in,” he said. Israel has long billed itself as “Startup Nation” for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. “This is far from a one-day or one-week story,” Granoff said. “This is going to be a story for the next 10 years.” Also Read: Uber self-driving cars are coming back to California roads Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google’s more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and othe sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. (Image for representation, Source: AP) “The deal confirms Israel’s global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies,” said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. “The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups.” There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Also Read: California says autonomous cars don’t need human drivers Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel’s autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. “This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak,” he said.

IndiaToday.in  desk-itgd@intoday.com New Delhi, March 18, 2017 | UPDATED 12:59 IST A +A - Technology is playing a pivotal role in making the world's art and culture accessible to anyone and anywhere, said Head of Google Arts and Culture Lab Laurent Gaveau. Speaking at the opening session of Day 2 at the India Today Conclave 2017 in Mumbai, Google's Laurent Gaveau introduced audience to a variety of endeavours launched by the company to help in preservation, discovery and creation of art. Gaveau talked in detail about one of most user-friendly products from the Google stable that helps people to rediscover art--the Google Art and Culture app. The Google app, Gaveau said, gives viewer a 360-degree view of artworks, monuments. It allows people to share the pictures they love with their friends. Imagine, enjoying a top-down view of the iconic Taj Mahal which one may not get even by visiting the monument site. The Google app comes with an art recogniser feature that allows one to get interesting details about the subject just by placing one's phone in front of it--be it a monument, an artwork or even a museum. WATCH: Google's Laurent Gaveau introduces audience to Google Art and Culture app Gaveau admitted that museums were initially skeptical about giving such virtual tours to people as they felt it may prevent them from visiting the actual site. However with time, he said, museums and curators have realised that the more they share, the more people will be interested in going to these places and enjoying the arts. At the session, Gaveau and artist Dhruvi Acharya demonstrated how artists are using technology to create art. Acharya used Google's Tilt Brush to create a virtual painting. "The brush was easy to use and I can walk through my painting," Acharya said, adding that artists of her generation are using more and more technology to create different forms of art.   For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in. ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.     # India Today Conclave 2017# Laurent Gaveau   Suggested Stories Recommended Watch Right Now Top Takes NEWS INDIA WORLD PHOTOS CRICKET MOVIES AUTO SPORTS LIFESTYLE TECH EDUCATION BUSINESS SITEMAP Copyright © 2017 Living Media India Limited.

Share Tweet Share Tags : T-Mobile-T-Mobile+ AT&T-AT&T+ Verizon-Verizon+ Sprint-Sprint+ LG-LG+ Android-Android+ The LG G6 is hot right now, better get it at the right price With the exception of T-Mobile (which will begin March 22), all national US carriers have started their LG G6 pre-orders. On the side of retailers, only Best Buy has carrier versions of the smartphone up for pre-order (click here), but the LG G6 will be sold by LG, Amazon, and B&H as well. We'll have to whip up a separate table with the retailer offers once they are revealed. Carrier prices vary across the board, with Verizon and US Cellular seemingly presenting the most compelling offers. T-Mobile has set up a lean, no-frills offer devoid of promotions beyond the free Google Home speaker that everyone is getting. Meanwhile, AT&T and Sprint have some interesting options as well, despite being on the pricier side. Hopefully, having good credit and being a long-time (or brand new) customer will net you better offers from these two. As always, read the fine print and spend responsibly.

It's way too expensive for a SD821, only 32GB, no Quad DAC, no wireless charging, gorilla glass 3 and a cheap 2015 camera sensors used in cheap Chinese phones. view all comments Want to comment?

Internet by Richard Nieva March 14, 2017 4:00 AM PDT @richardjnieva Jigsaw, one of the projects of Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt, has launched a tool to explain technical terms to you. James Martin/CNET It might sound obvious, but the thing about tech is that sometimes it can get really, well, technical. So Alphabet wants to help make nitty-gritty tech jargon simpler to explain to the masses. On Tuesday, Jigsaw, a tech incubator owned by Google's parent company, launched a website called the Sideways Dictionary that takes jargon and puts it into terms normal people would understand. Jigsaw partnered with the Washington Post to build the tool. Here's how it works. Type in a term and the site gives you analogies that would make sense to laypeople. Jigsaw For example, type in "encryption" and here's one of the analogies you'll get: "It's like sending a sealed letter instead of a postcard. To ban encryption would be like requiring all mail to be sent as postcards, including bank statements, medical letters and holiday photos. Your postman, neighbors and postal service would soon know you pretty well." A tool like this could be helpful because technology touches almost every aspect of our lives now. Every time you go on a website, you're probably encountering "cookies" that help personalize the page for you. A "DDoS attack" could bring down your favorite website for a certain amount of time. A "zero-day" exploit is a previously unknown cybersecurity vulnerability. And if powerful enough, in some cases it could wreak havoc and expose your passwords or credit card information. So yeah, it would be good if people knew what all those things mean. Jigsaw, formerly called Google Ideas, is one of the projects of Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt. It's a think tank and company that nurtures young tech startups that tackle issues ranging from online censorship to violent extremism, according to its website. The company's president is Jared Cohen, a former State Department staffer. For the Sideways Dictionary, Jigsaw even enlisted the help of Schmidt himself as well as Vint Cerf, who is considered one of the "fathers of the internet" and who now works at Google as chief internet evangelist, to write some of the analogies. Here are the ones from Schmidt: Machine Learning: It's like reading tea leaves. Because it's about recognizing patterns in data in order to predict what comes next. Except it works. Cloud Computing: It's like a library, not a book store. A simple way to access every book on the planet without having to own them all. And here are the ones from Cerf: Internet Protocol Packets: These are like postcards. They have "from" and "to" addresses and limited content. You put them into the "Internet postbox" and they magically appear at the destination. They are not reliable, however, so another protocol, called Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) makes sure all the contents of the postcards get there, even duplicate postcards need to be re-sent. TCP also clears out duplicates and manages the flow of postcard traffic to avoid overloading the recipients Internet postbox. Domain Name Servers: This is like a contact list in your mobile phone. You know your correspondents by their names but the contact list has telephone numbers and postal addresses. When you want to go to a particular web site, you look up the site's name (such as www.google.com) in the Domain Name lookup service and get back from that the Internet Protocol address of the destination Web Site. Internet Protocol Address: This is a numeric address that identifies where a destination computer is attached to the Internet, similar to a postal address for a destination residence or business.

By Elisabeth Atzler and Katharina Schneider Published on 16. March 2017, 15:00 Why it matters Why it matters U.S. tech firms Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon are making increasingly ambitious forays into financial services, while German banks have been slow off the mark when it comes to digitalization.

But to people working in the financial sector, it was a bombshell. To be sure, the new service doesn’t amount to a technological innovation — established banks are working on or already offering their own phone-to-phone money transfer apps. But Google’s push into the payments market has made bankers around the world realize that the U.S. tech titans are moving into their back yard. Google launched Android Pay, a payments service for smart phones, a year-and-a-half ago, and Apple has had a similar service even longer. All four big internet companies — Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple – already offer financial services. They’re no match yet compared with the plethora of services provided by traditional banks. But the banks are getting worried, more worried in fact than about competition from the legions of financial technology start-ups. Confronted by a common enemy, fintechs and banks are increasingly starting to cooperate. In Germany, there are already 70 such alliances. Want to keep reading?

Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" Finally Google Chrome will apparently stop sucking all your laptop battery By Richard Devine Wednesday, Mar 15, 2017 at 7:40 am EDT 42 Comments If there was ever an award for battery life sucker of the year, Google Chrome would be a permanent top three. Despite the fact that Google wants you to use its browser, Microsoft the same, there's always been one elephant standing on top of your laptop if you wanted to use Google Chrome: It drains battery like no other browser. Google has apparently decided it's now time to address this, promising fixes in Chrome 57. As reported by our pals at Android Central: Google is constantly evolving Chrome to be less power hungry while also offering increased performance, and the latest development arriving in Chrome 57 focuses on power savings from further background tab management. With the latest version, tabs open but not currently in use will be more aggressively throttled to save power. Essentially Chrome 57 will limit background activity on tabs you're not currently looking at to stop the browser from gobbling up so much power. It all sounds good, and in theory should work, but we'll not sound the party alarm just yet until we've actually seen it live up to its claims. Reader comments Google Chrome will apparently stop sucking all your laptop battery 42 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating CaedenV Seriously? Is battery life such an issue anymore? After the update last fall (v54? 55?) I noticed much better battery life. Chrome already fixed most of the issue. Edge may well have better battery life, but it also does not do half of what Chrome does. Chrome is a whole OS and application platform that happens to also browse the web. If you still just browse the internet, then Edge is fine. But if you live in the world of mobile apps then there is just no replacing Chrome any time soon, and as Android apps slowly come to the platform this will only entrench Chrome usage even more. 0 3 days ago Reply DJCBS I never had battery sucking problems with Chrome on the SP3 but hey, if they're making it better, that's fine with me. At any rate I wouldn't be using inferior browsers like Edge anyway, even if Chrome drained the battery quickly. 0 4 days ago Reply thomasayri The cia has been blocked 0 4 days ago Reply SammyD97 Issa lie! 0 5 days ago Reply bogascorp The only reason I switched to chrome fulltime was because of it's cross platform availability. I have a Desktop PC, a MacBook an iPad and an Android phone. Passwords, history and so on all sync seamlessly across devices. I love Edge, it's way smoother when using animations. Everything is hardware accelerated. Just wish they released a cross platform version, even if they changed the name or added a new word to the existing name (ex: Microsoft Edge Light). I don't know. Something to make us want to use Microsoft services. 0 5 days ago Reply CaedenV Could not agree more. If Edge was everywhere and not tied to Windows then it would stand a chance. But they are developing Edge like a '90s style web browser and not realizing that Chrome and FireFox are playing a whole different game now. Even if Edge was perfect at web browsing (which it still isn't), it is not being set up to do what the other platforms do with apps, extensions, and manageability in the enterprise. If they get their act together then Edge could be a thing... they just don't seem to get it. 0 3 days ago Reply Mani Malekizadeh Edge is amazing and i have security issue on google service 0 5 days ago Reply HarnessTech As a web developer, the only thing stopping me from dropping Chrome is the poor inspector included in Edge. 0 5 days ago Reply Cartman Was using Chrome for Windows Central as it seems to hang on Edge.

Once I checked task manager and there were around 15 Chrome incidents running simultaneously. 3 5 days ago Reply Gatanui Chrome has a seperate process for each tab or two or three. This in itself does not increase power consumption, though, nor does it slow down the system. Edge also handles tabs like this, by the way. 0 5 days ago Reply MrElectrifyer Edge does the same, simply click the arrow at the side of it in task manager and notice the loads of processes it has. Chrome never slowed down my Surface Pro 2, speed wasn't the problem, in fact, without an ad blocker, Chrome is significantly faster than Edge. Edge 99% of the time just shows a stupid error that the page isn't responding whenever I disable uBlock origins, same happens here on Windows Central. The reason I didtched Chrome for good was that it's an intentionally stupidly gimped experience on my Surface Pro, similar to what this user described here ( http://sck.pm/2sX ), and fkn google doesn't seem to care to fix that, so, they can screw off with their gimped software. 0 5 days ago Reply Satish Singh Edge even works smoothly on my Windows 10 tablet with 1 GB RAM and my smartphone.

Microsoft has a long history of trying to pave their own path, frequently in a different direction than that of the market, requiring near-failure and extreme correction to recover. One example is their fall from 24% mobile marketshare, to 6.5% when they realized Windows Mobile 6.5 wasn't cutting it any more - to the fall to 1% today after launching a legitimately great Windows Phone 7 and 8 - but ONLY launching it on phones, in a market that's actively avoiding laptops and PCs for casual use... Microsoft failing to recognize that Windows (the "Stigma of Windows", actually), with all it's complexities and need for an MCSE family member of friend to keep it going, is the reason why people fear turning it on.  It's a shame because if they had launched phones AND tablets with - let's have called it Windows Mobile 7 (then 8) instead - I think today they'd be a real third player in mobile.  They'd certainly have a presence. (and come on - how many times over the years - decades - has Microsoft tried to do 'Windows on a tablet!" and failed?  Let's acknowledge the common denominator here.  Microsoft would have internally been ashamed if it launched true mobile OS tablets, and they outsold Windows, and boosted Windows Mobile phone sales.) Same goes with browsers.  Nothing - absolutely nothing - was worse than Internet Explorer 6.  If you work in IT you know what I mean - there's applications that remain that require it today, because it was so non-standard, applications coded for it became dependent on it.  And web sites coded for the larger web (adhering to web standards) broke on it.  Even out as far as IE 9, 10, and 11 (which aren't too bad at all - which) people complianed about how slow the browser was.  No one wants to launch a browser and take a coffee break before it opens.  Enter Google Chrome.  And really, much like the world was confused by Windows RT on tablets (is it mobile? full Windows? What is it?) and ultimately it failed, now Microsoft has Edge... which is the new Internet Explorer, following IE11.  Wait... no? It's not?  Hold up then... it's... what? why? Microsoft is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE at 1) understanding the current state of the market, 2) making changes that make sense, and 3) communicating why they made radical changes. That's not exactly a solid foundation to jump right on the bandwagon when it rolls by. -4 5 days ago Reply Hoppman Chrome is just google's ad delivery system, nothing more nothing less. 1 5 days ago Reply bleached Yes, that is exactly what it is. Google doesn't hide that. It also is a cross platform browser that syncs on all your devices. It has a simple UI, tons of features and great performance (battery life could be better on some platforms). It obviously does its job well as it is the most used browser by far. 0 4 days ago Reply dicks-webos No Chrome - I do not get it that people give Google all their data (Chrome tracks even how you use the app).

He provides unique big picture analysis of the complex world of Microsoft. Jason takes the small clues and gives you an insightful big picture perspective through storytelling that you won't find anywhere else. Seriously, this dude thinks outside the box. Follow him on Twitter at @JLTechWord. He's doing the "write" thing! I recently read an interesting article by respected writer and analyst Walt Mossberg, who said the PC is being redefined. I agree. But ... I've described the evolving personal computing landscape in the past. To communicate an accurate picture of the modern personal computing environment and the influencing factors that have shaped it, I've acknowledged that it's impossible to ignore the impact of the iPhone. Though smartphones existed before the iPhone, those business-focused devices were not relevant to the masses. The iPhone, with its "massive" touch screen merged the iPod, a phone and an internet device, and redefined the smartphone. Consumers loved it as much as they loved the popular iPod that primed them for a pocketable consumer-focused smartphone from Apple. Eventually, the iPhone and the "there's-an-app-for-that" model, which made it a veritable "swiss-army mobile computing device," evolved into much more than the phone-iPod-internet device introduced by former Apple CEO Steve Jobs in 2007. In time, Apple's introduction of the iPhone had a profound effect on the personal computing landscape. The iPhone, Android phones and to a lesser extent Windows phones — all with their supporting app ecosystems, integrated services, always-connected nature and pocketability — supplanted the traditional PC as the most used personal computers. Yes, smartphones are personal computing devices. Microsoft, not Apple, is more instrumental to the evolution of the PC. I agree with Mossberg that the mobile computing environment and ecosystems that shape personal computing today are influencers on what the PC will ultimately be. However, I disagree with his assessment that a significant shift to the new type of ARM-based PC that runs mobile apps will be determined by Apple. Millions of consumers already buy laptops that use "mobile apps" Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and Windows 10 laptops and 2-in-1s have already begun the process of bringing consumers to a laptop form factor that runs mobile apps, as well as traditional apps. This computing environment will be brought to ARM processors, as ARM-based Windows 10 PCs begin rolling out in several months. The change to an ARM-based system will be largely transparent to users. What won't be transparent are the advantages of ARM-based cellular Windows 10 PCs. Among other advantages, consumers will reap the benefits of lower costs, and lighter, fan-less and more power-efficient Windows 10 PCs. Mossberg said the following of a shift to ARM in relation to this problem: But the signs of a shift to ARM only set the stage for a bigger development: The migration of the most important modern software platforms, Android and iOS, to laptops and other traditional hardware that once defined the old kind of PC. ... I believe it won't matter much until Apple builds an ARM-based laptop running iOS. Here's why. Microsoft ... does have a modern breed of multi-touch apps that work properly on a tablet or clamshell screen, and some are included on every Windows tablet and laptop. Unfortunately, partly because Microsoft has no smartphone business to speak of, it also lacks a critical mass of these new-style apps and, even on its tablets, relies instead on classic Windows apps. Apple, by contrast, boasts 1.3 million tablet-optimized apps for the iPad, and these could presumably easily run on a small laptop with a built-in keyboard and touchscreen. This is more than a small advantage; it's the reason people might buy this type of device instead of a traditional laptop. I agree with the general assessments Mossberg puts forth. I also see the value in his conclusion that Apple, because of its vast and appealing app ecosystem, occupies an influential position. Consumer love for iOS apps may be a sufficient motivating factor for the masses to consciously and deliberately choose to use a laptop running those same mobile apps. That's if Apple can deliver a good mouse-and-keyboard productivity experience. Can Apple generate interest in a laptop that runs only mobile apps? I put forth a similar analysis in relation to Google's position if it ever decided to merge Chrome and Android. Google's 80 percent dominance of the mobile market would be a real threat to Microsoft's 90 percent dominance in PCs if Google brought a viable desktop experience to a desktop environment. Microsoft already invented the universal app 'wheel' Apple needs iOS apps are optimized for a slate consumption-based experience, not a peripheral-enhanced productivity setting. Mossberg stated the following in relation to this problem: The definition of a PC, a personal computer, is already undergoing a profound change. A great laptop running the new kinds of user interfaces and apps that people now love on phones and tablets would be a big, exciting event that would help seal the deal. But there hasn't yet been a product that emphatically suggests the era of the traditional PC is fading. And it feels like an opportunity only Apple can seize. Microsoft's Windows 10 and Universal Platform with Continuum are driving the evolution of the PC while also keeping the traditional PC around. Rather than just a clamshell laptop that runs mobile apps, which is Mossberg's vision for an evolved PC, Microsoft's strategy is more comprehensive. Microsoft's PC vision is more comprehensive than mobile apps on a laptop. Redmond saw the coming shift and created a device form factor with the Surface, a context-sensitive OS in Windows 10 and a Universal Platform that provides a common core for all device types and app development. The research firm IDC said the following, confirming the success and adoption of Windows laptops and 2-in-1s in a recent report: Consumers are just starting to graduate from old, consumption-based, slate tablets to a more productive detachable tablet. At the same time, the benefits of having a thin, touch-sensitive, productivity-based machine is [sic] shining light on the traditional PC category, causing vendors and consumers to focus on more premium devices in the Convertible and Ultraslim space. As the tablet market works through the challenges of a maturing user base, the notebook ecosystem has seen success in assimilating a more mobile experience to the form factor while retaining its inherent superiority in the content creation arena, which remains critical for commercial buyers. Absent major external forces, IDC believes the notebook and traditional PC market overall will see relatively stable volumes with some growth in more mobile designs offset by declines in less mobile products. As we watch the unfolding of Microsoft's strategy with the industry's embrace of 2-in-1s, Windows 10 laptops and PCs and Windows Mixed Reality (formerly Windows Holographic), Microsoft's impact on the evolution of the PC, in all of its forms, obviously exceeds Apple's. Technologically, Microsoft is where Mossberg hopes Apple will get Mossberg states, "Apple … boasts 1.3 million tablet-optimized apps for the iPad, and these could presumably easily run on a small laptop with a built-in keyboard and touchscreen." He supplies the caveat "presumably" in acknowledgment of his (and all of our) uncertainty as to the viability of iOS apps running on a small laptop with a built-in keyboard (and mouse). iOS apps are not yet optimized for a laptop environment. By contrast, we know with full certainty that Microsoft's unique UWP allows Windows Store apps to run on phones, laptops, 2-in-1s, HoloLens, Xbox, desktop PCs and any as yet to be created Windows devices. Most Windows 10 devices also run Win32 apps in conjunction with Store apps, and Windows 10 on ARM may bring that ability to phones. What Mossberg speculates would be a technological advancement for the Apple ecosystem already exists in far greater depth and breadth as part of Microsoft's UWP. Mossberg's vision of an evolved PC is a laptop with iOS apps and only iOS apps. Microsoft's personal computer vision is far broader than that. Windows 10 is key to the modern PC Though Windows 10 is only running on 400 million devices, Windows is a desktop and mobile platform. In less than two years, though far below it's one billion devices target, 400 million devices is impressive. iOS and Android have had roughly a decade to reach the billion mark those OSes achieved. Windows 10 is an evolution of the OS that embraces mobile computing. Some may argue that Windows 10 is merely an upgrade to the Windows OS that has a billion installed base. It is actually more of an evolution toward a new type of OS that retains the legacy strengths of the traditional desktop while adopting the necessary attributes of the modern, mobile personal computing environment. Universal Windows Apps, along with the coming full Windows on ARM and CShell on all types of mobile devices, help us visualize this reality. When viewing it from that proper perspective, the unique unified desktop and mobile OS that is Windows 10 has already begun to achieve in a very real way what Mossberg anticipates will be achieved with Android and iOS: bringing a relevant "mobile" OS to a desktop clamshell form factor. The market is buying, but may not "buy into" Microsoft's vision The PC's transformation, based on Windows 10 2-in-1s and even laptops, has already been accepted in the market by OEMs and consumers. Mossberg's vision awaits a move from Apple to create wide acceptance for what the success of Windows 2-in-1s is already achieving: market-wide acceptance of a laptop (or 2-in-1) OS that runs mobile apps. The Windows Store on a Windows 10 desktop has thousands of universal apps that work across various form factors, including mobile. I concede that the success of the Windows Store is not on par with Microsoft's goals. Moreover, the implementation of a Windows-based smartphone has not met commercial success. Consequently, though there are thousands of universal apps that are compatible beyond the mobility of a laptop or 2-in-1 form factor, and that work on a phone, the number is dwarfed by the number of iOS apps in the App Store. So yes, the popularity of iOS apps, if somehow made to work as efficiently in a mouse-and-keyboard laptop form factor, would produce more of a "conscious" decision by consumers to seek out or inquire about such a device. These consumers may be motivated by a desire to use the mobile apps they're familiar with from their iPhones, on a laptop-like device. PC consumers are likely not motivated by an opportunity to experience Store apps. By contrast, the universal apps that are part of Microsoft's proliferating "evolving PC" vision and that are also available to users who buy Windows 10 2-in-1s and laptops are in many cases likely just "along for the ride." Candidly speaking, these user purchases are likely less motivated by the opportunity to experience universal apps and their benefits than by the productivity legacy of Window PCs, even as manifest in modern touch-enabled laptops and 2-in-1s. The Windows Store's underperformance is likely one of the motivating factors in Microsoft's increasingly aggressive advertising efforts in Windows 10. It needs to get users that have embraced the new OS and evolving PC form-factors to also embrace the ecosystem that they exist within. Apple, with the popularity of iOS apps, but the lack of a truly universal platform akin to the UWP, and the efficient productivity environment that Windows 10 PCs bring mobile apps, would have the exact opposite challenge. Microsoft's impact on PC evolution is both deep and broad Ultimately, I agree with Mossberg's conclusion from a consumer perspective. That is, if Microsoft cannot draw developers and consumers to its modern app ecosystem, Apple may be more successful in drawing consumer "attention" to the concept of a mobile-app-focused laptop. That's if Apple invests in and successfully creates an iOS-based laptop, which the famously secretive company has made no indication of doing. I do, however, believe that Mossberg may be underestimating the industry impact Microsoft's Windows 10 and UWP has had, and is currently having, on the evolution of the PC, in the form of touch-sensitive laptops, 2-in-1s and other devices like HoloLens that run universal apps. Mossberg may be underestimating Microsoft's impact on the PC's evolution. OEM's, consumers, businesses, and various industries have greatly embraced these "modern," evolved PCs. As Microsoft's partners begin bringing ARM-based cellular PCs to market in several months, that impact will be even more evident than it is now. In truth, Apple's mimicry of the Surface with the iPad Pro is indicative of its reactive, or follower's role, in the PC's evolution. The evolution is well underway. Microsoft is driving it, and its plan goes even further than Mossberg's vision of mobile apps on a laptop form factor.

I'm oldschool enough to remember that once, Bill Gates thought that the future for MS was entertainment content! I also agree that MS will define the future of PC computing for some time to come. Apple, by contrast, went the route of non-stop upgrades and rollouts for the generations they assume will always have no issue paying $500 plus for a fancy communications device, every year. Their hardware vision is pure marketing. Meanwhile, as fun as it is, the world has changed, security wise, and now not even Apple owners are safe from hackers and virus infections. In addition, inb my mind, the continuing safe state of Cloud Computing remains viable as long as the servers can keep moving constantly to avoid detection. I still prefer to store my own data on a local drive. I can secure it myself, and shut it down overnight, etc. But then, I come out of a DIY culture and distrust anything I can't take-apart, fix and reassemble. I've built our home and business systems since the i286, and appreciate the more affordable, egalitarian approach to operating systems and hardware design that MS has given the PC World. MS has had several misfires, like most companies, but they manage to rise again, as have some of the underdog hardware manufacturers like AMD (my own preferred processor, BTW...). I think Windows will be running on all kinds of machines for a long time to come. 0 4 days ago Reply VITNE Maybe Microsoft needs to stop calling them apps and go back to calling them programs. Before iPhone, I never heard anyone say "I just got this new computer app." It was always the word "program." It may seem silly, but "app" sounds mobile and weak and "program" sounds powerful. Maybe call the Windows Store the "Windows Software Store" "app" became the buzzword after iPhone took off. Now everyone associates apps with mobile. Seeing as how MS is marrying the mobile side and desktop side with things like Continuum, maybe they need to think about word associations and the mentality behind them. Maybe just switching to the terms "software" and "program" will put the power of Windows back in people's minds, regardless of form factor. 2 4 days ago Reply ED the new guy The genie is out of the bottle. People have tasted a world not dominated by Microsoft and it's working for them. Microsoft missed the boat when they failed to challenge Chrome on the desktop and iOS and then Android in the mobile device sphere. These two operating systems have wrested a whole generation away from Microsoft's sphere of influence. Chrome's success with HTML 5 on the desktop has allowed a whole generation to become platform agnostic. And, it's also taken a substantial chunk out of previous generations. Web services are where the <30 crowd is at, and, the operating system that gives access to those services is irrelevant. You can just as easily run Chrome on a stripped down single purpose Linux OS as you can on a full blown Windows OS and still get 100% of the experience. You can easily switch between Mac OS X, Windows, Android and iOS because the experience is mediated by HTML 5! PS App is the new program. I now on the verge of needing bifocals and I have a hard time keeping app and program straight. People who aren't techies don't know the difference. To them an app is a program. Besides, app is a good short form for application. To me application is program that the user uses to perform tasks. A program is simply a piece of compiled code. It could be part of the OS or part of an application but does not in and of itself directly useful to the user. 0 4 days ago Reply md2boys This is all great, but lets get on with it.  I have been waiting for a new Microsoft Mobile device for some time now.  The HP is nice, but I'd like ot see the new Surface mobile I keep reading about.  What's taking so long, my Nokia 1520 is getting old and needs to be replaced!!! 0 4 days ago Reply Tom French2 With 10 still in a flux state improving with every update it is only a matter of time before the store apps will improve.  Right now the consumer drives the iOS and Android platforms in the mobile environment but when mobile in Windows is fully implemented then it may not completely catch up but I believe will gain some ground on the others.  They too are now being forced to rethink what they are doing because of Microsoft and Windows 10.  While what they have is nice to use I still don't like the appearance of their start screens or the lack of flexibility they do not have that Windows does in mobile.  If Satya had been in charge of Microsoft 2 years earlier we would be talking a much different mobile platform already.  The mobile platform would be a much larger share of the market than it is now.  0 4 days ago Reply AgentTheGreat "A matter of time"...yes.

It's why they emphasized hardware accessories with the iPad Pro and not so much the software. Google lacks the focus to lead this, imo.

Whether it's TV, tech sites, or companies who make money evaluating the tech industry, they all act like Apple is dominating everything.

Just because they are worth a fortune due to using older, lesser technology while charging more for it, doesn't mean they are dominating. It just means they are making their investors happy. Secondly, Apple was never innovative and neither was Steve Jobs. They have never invented anything, they never created a "new" product. They have always taken an existing product and made it look better and usually work better. That's great but it doesn't make you innovative. And Steve Jobs wasn't anything he has been made out to be. He was an ass, a selfish jerk. He was a guy who screwed over old partners, who refused to acknowledge his own daughter was his for years. He was a guy didn't want apps on the iPhone and almost shut down the whole iPad project because ge didn't like the tone of white they were using.

Why do I focus on laptop replacement, rather than "smartphones?"  Because the future is computing devices, not phones.  And computing devices need software, which is why iOS and Android are winning.  If Microsoft can build the best computing devices (they are THIS close to doing so), the developers will follow.  In other words, the best software requires people to build it, and those people prefer to work on the best hardware.  Apple has squandered its multiyear lead on hardware superiority, Google isn't in that game, so it is Microsoft's for the taking. 2 5 days ago Reply kansokusha Microsoft will do all the innovation, and they'll screw themselves and their customers with horrible implementation and abysmal product support.

So very Americentric. -1 5 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi I think I agree with your assertion about Microsoft driving the evolution of the PC. It is a fact that Apple (and later Google with Android) broadened the scope, experience and market for personal computing. For some reason, I keep feeling like Microsoft's adherence to a Enterprise-first consumer base keeps limiting them from developing truly consumer-wowing (and consistent) user experiences: E.g. 1: Teams is an awesome product but they lock it within the enterprise (i.e. O365) ensuring that few outside of the 85 million (?) O365 users would ever go for it (so Slack slurps the "outcasts" up), making Teams seems more like a defensive move against Slack encroaching on existing (and future?) O365 users rather than a superior take. If it were a free/low-cost non-O365 (at first) tool, Teams could probably be used to draw people into the main ecosystem (see all the cool things you can get it to do with O365). E.g. 2: Windows 8/10 and the UI/UX confusions and inconsistencies (till date). Windows 10 (with a UI refresh) is good for desktop, but tablet and mobile are lighter and should have lighter UI. Touch-enabled Win 10 is not necessarily good enough as a tablet-only UI (especially in the 7-9" range). Legacy (business) makes them shoehorn different UI paradigms together, limiting the power of the Live Tile to evolve and show its superiority to other UI/UX paradigms). It's not whoever has the best designed product or innovation, it's whoever sells and blasts the goodness and uniqueness of their product early enough (and says they did it first and best) that gets noticed. Microsoft must point out the new innovations they bring to the market first. Not just to tech press but the general public. Look at the new HP ads with Christian Slater! Look at the responses. Relevant and good publicity (and that's just for printers). Microsoft will always attract only the work-related perception from consumers and the tech press as long as it always sells itself only on "productivity" (=business). That is why I like the focus on "Creativity" (a la Creative Update, etc.). I think it should be more than a one-off update name but rather a modern ethos (a sort of Productivity 2.0?) for Microsoft. The Creative Lifestyle. Maybe two marketing identities for business (productive) and consumers (creative)? 0 5 days ago Reply Asc aris Windows 8/10 and the UI/UX confusions and inconsistencies (till date). Windows 10 (with a UI refresh) is good for desktop, but tablet and mobile are lighter and should have lighter UI. Touch-enabled Win 10 is not necessarily good enough as a tablet-only UI (especially in the 7-9" range). So Windows 10 needs a UI refresh to be good for desktop, and is not well suited to mobile either in its current form.  If that is what you're saying, I agree completely.  What it looks like is that MS has designed "one UI to rule them all" that is equally mediocre on both of the platforms it's supposed to cover.  It seems that a lot of the excitement over this isn't about the product as delivered, but is instead about the promise of what it might deliver in the future once the rough spots are smoothed out.  Unfortunately, though, I think that the rough spots are not merely a function of as-yet incomplete development so much as a structural issue that has to do with the very nature of generalization vs. specialization.  The better MS makes Windows 10 for tablets (and phones even more so), the worse it ends up being for the desktop.  They can move that slider to an infinite number of positions along the "continuum"  between mobile and desktop platforms, but favoring one will always mean hampering the other, and that's not just an issue of polish or fine-tuning.   Ultimately, it all boils down to yet another proof of the "Jack of all trades, master of none" trope.  Mobile devices and traditional PCs have differing needs, and when you try to write one UI that covers both, it's just not going to work as well on either of them as a dedicated UI for that platform-- and since we do have examples of that on desktops (Windows 7, MacOS) and mobiles (Android, iOS), the bar is going to be set as high as the perceived quality and fitness of each dedicated UI.  Windows 10 falls far short of what desktop users have had for many years in terms of a polished, consistent, and visually coherent UI.  It still feels confused about whether it wants to be a phone or a PC. If MS insists on going down this road, the only way I can really see it working is to have two complete UIs within Windows, and to select the one that is most appropriate according to circumstance and user preferences.  Desktop PCs and traditional laptops would have the desktop UI, same as Windows always has, while mobiles would get the UWP UI.  Each UI would be feature-complete by itself and optimized for its platform, so there would never be any need to muddle through on a bit of the OS that was designed for a platform other than the one then in use.  Convertible/2 in 1 devices could default to the desktop UI when in laptop mode, and to the UWP UI when the keyboard/base is removed.  The user, ideally, would be able to change these settings to suit his needs better, since one size rarely (if ever) fits all. When you look at it in those terms, it doesn't seem all that innovative anymore (to me at least).  Including two complete UIs for two separate platforms, running on two different sets of binaries (x86 and ARM, of course) that happen to have been compiled from similar/the same source code sounds a lot like writing two distinct (though closely related) operating systems for two distinct platforms, then slapping the same name on each and caling it one product.  It may not be as "gee whiz" cool in its implementation, but it would allow a no-compromise UI for each platform, and I don't think users will (or should have to) accept anything less than that.   0 2 days ago Reply Bai So we go a full cycle and back to RT?  C-shell seriously don't matter to most.  Cellar PC, a fancy name of smartphone.  When was the last time you use a use a x86 program for personal use?  Me photo editing is the only x86 I still use, and that I don't want/care about ARM and battery life because no battery will last a few hundred RAW convertion.  I either have it plug in all the way or do it on my PC.  For office use, why do I want a ARM laptop 2-1 or whatever when I can have my x86 CRM on a regular laptop?  Or I can remote it from any Android/IOS/WP/PC.  Wake me up when adobe/sales force/auto cad...etc make a ARM UWP.  For productivity cloud is the future and cloud don't care what the front end is, it could be ios/android/wp it don't matter.  There are companies that send cad project to hosting company to render and cut the time in 1/2.  There are online RAW converter alreadyInot a very good one).  Continuum make a alot of sense, and I don't need a full feature win10 fo it. 0 5 days ago Reply LIEBER I'm interested in the possibility of running Windows 10 Pro on ARM processors. Will it be possible to run *all* Win32 bit applications on ARM 835 processor, in emulation mode? How does this relate to HP Elite X3 and the possibility to run ordinary applications on a HP server? An alternative approach... is to use an "old fashioned" solution. 30 years ago, it was possible to run X Windows terminals and remotely log in via a network. A modern solution could be: * MS includes a Windows terminal program (similar to Teamviewer, etc.) as part of Windows 10 * It should be possible to remotely log into another Windows machine via internet or via 4G/5G phone networks; it must be possible to reach through routers, firewalls, etc. * Assuming I have a desktop computer, job work station, home media computer, etc., and that I have all the 32 bit or 64 bit applications I need on these, it should be possible to log in from ARM based (and intel based) smartphones, tablets, laptops, or in principle any type of computer ("terminal machine"), and run the programs on my desktop, workstation, media computer, etc. ("server machine") -- remotely * The "terminal window" should mirror the desktop on the "server" computer. * If I have two screens on my "terminal" PC, it should be possible to run the terminal window on one screen, and run other programs on any screen. * It should be possible to cut and paste between the "terminal" PC and the terminal window of the "server". * If both "terminal" PC and the "server" PC sync files via OneDrive (or DropBox, or whatever), this gives transparent exchange of files. But copy and pasting may still be useful. OK... personally, I'm a little skeptical about completely depending on running programs on a remote computer -- what if internet is down (or the connection is slow), or what if there are expensive roaming fees on 4G/5G? So I certainly see the usefulness of running 32 bit (and if possible, 64 bit) applications on the smartphone/tablet/etc. (ARM processor, etc.), but a modern "terminal" program will make it possible to, in practice, run 32 bit and 64 bit programs on relatively light weight ARM processor based units. The main problem with this approach is with small screen devices such as smartphones: I'm not sure the user experience will be good with running *applications* on a small screen -- maybe a foldable screen device may make it possible to fold out a decent screen? UWP apps is something else -- they are designed to adapt to various screen sizes. 0 5 days ago Reply L0n3N1nja IPad apps as they currently are on a laptop? I don't see that ever going anywhere.

In the public mindspace, Windows is still a desktop OS - when they want a mobile it's Android or iOS. Part of this is Microsoft's failed "Continuum" strategy in their UI - it's still the exact same UI not matter what device you're on. This is a problem because ​people don't want a desktop/start menu on their mobile device​. This is something Microsoft hasn't learned since the days of Windows CE. Windows 8 was a good start, but failed because the "Desktop Mode" should have been more Windows 10 and Windows 10 fails the tablet/moble users because it needs to be more Windows 8. The idea is a great one, they NEED to figure out that "Desktop UI" is NOT the same as "Tablet UI" is not the same as "Phone UI" (though Tablet UI and Phone UI should be much closer to each other than Desktop UI).

Love or hate Apple, you need to thank them what they did in the market. They opened it up to more of a smart device from what were using. If you wanted a SMART device, you  had a Windows Mobile/PocketPC (a pocket Windows version with the bugs) or Blackberry. Apple came with a store, and the format Microsoft has always dreamed of.  Maybe Microsoft would of came up with it but, they were 5 years too late and by then, they lost. I can go deeper into this but, Microsoft is not doing anything besides making Windows compatable with current SMALLER devices. Nothing new, just a smaller package.   -6 5 days ago Reply HenriqueNL This is all very nice and I agree with most of the article, but if Microsoft doesn't advertise what the Windows 10 vision is and how it works on several form factors, people will never realize all the positives laid out in this article. That is why time and time again, Apple or Google (through Samsung in the majority of cases) will always be heralded as the companies that "invented" features Microsoft already had before. When was the last time you saw a Microsoft ad showcasing Windows 10? I'm not talking about PC/Surface ads, but what Microsoft is doing with and for Windows 10. A 30 second ad of Windows on different form factors (including phone) would start to make people look and think more closely to Microsoft and maybe call out certain tech sites when they start babbling about how great feature x or y is on iOS or Android. The rare Microsoft ads I see in the UK on television are for the Cloud. I know professionals also watch TV but it doesn't showcase anything "useful" for the regular Joe. And it's not like Microsoft doesn't have some good hardware/form factors to show off: Xbox One, HoloLens, Elite X3, Surface Pro/Book. If people knew all of the above run Windows 10 (and not necessarily version x86/64, Mobile, etc) then maybe people (consumers and developers) can see one of the advantages of UWP and build/port more apps and services over. All of this of course won't mean anything if Microsoft doesn't push harder to improve the OS as a whole, instead of spending resources in helping out other platforms with apps containing more features. 6 5 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi You said it all! 1 5 days ago Reply sdreamer Totally agree MS is pushing the tech arena lately, but is getting almost 0 credit. We can see how Apple and Google reacted to the Surface Pro line with their own Pro lines. You can also see some new AR headsets that seem to suddenly pop after the hololens was released. MS is really pushing hard for new things, but the market just doesn't see them anymore sadly. Then their lack of consistent support, and quality of support in some cases  really does not help. Apple really has a solid foundation right now, and many draw comparison to MS back then, but the key difference is users like Apple vs back then it was the cool thing to poke at MS. Apple too is too big to fail, but even if they start to, they are so well liked that it's almost impossible to really topple; maybe stumble, but not fall face first. I just wish MS was consistent, delivered the hardward they envisioned. I'd still be on a WP if they probably had the hardware, but they don't right now, and the company that offers the most consistent experience for productivity for me right now is Apple, and I've slowly transitioned to them but still using MS services as a backbone, and that works just great. 2 5 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi I agree that MS has not always executed well enough the first time out, even when they had the lead.

There's no denying the impact Apple has had in shifting personal computing from a sedentary setting to a mobile landscape. That shift has mad mobile ecosystems and apps very important. The need for a the desktop productivity environment has not been eliminated, however. The move of the mobile landscape to the desktop environment is what we are seeing happenng. It is also what Mossberg has argued will be a massive shift as ARM processors come on laptop form factors and IF iOS also comes to that form factor. He argues that Apple will have the greatest impact in refining the PC. I argue that Microsoft, with Windows 10, the UWP and Continuum has already done, and is driving that evolution. PC makers and consumers have embraced Microsoft's PC vision. Apple is following. It is true however that most PC users are not using the Store apps, which if they are full UWP apps, are by nature also mobile apps. This is where Apple, with iOS on laptop may conciously win users to a laptop with a mobile app focus. So what do you think.

Microsoft's attempts are most of the time half-hearted and incomplete. Take WP for example. How long did we scream about updates for simple things the competition had for years? It wasn't too hard to create a decent music player on WP8.1. Now look at the Windows 10 built-in Store apps. Almost all of them seem incomplete, lacking clear design guidelines and crashing as if interns are responsible for creating the most important part of Microsoft's future. For all their "expertise" in creating software, Microsoft lacks skill in creating almost any form of software related to mobile - Windows 10 Mobile being the prime example. (I don't believe it deseves to be WP 8.1's successor in any way). The Tablet Mode on Windows 10 SUCKS. Watching a video in Tablet Mode, double click on the video and watch is the window visibly resizes to smaller size and then goes back o full screen, indicaing sloppy coding. Closeing some Win32 windows in tablet mode results in a blank screen where you can't do anything, instead of going back to the Start screen. The whole thing is incomplete, and second grade software like this will NOT challenge Apple in the long run. When Microsoft themselves decided the Windws Explorer in full screen is good enough to take care of file management even in Tablet Mode, why would anyone decide to create UWP apps for tablets and limit themselves framework-wise when they can create Win32 and target all Windows versions? This whole strategy is all patch work and will not hold up against a proper attack from either Apple or Google targeting the desktop. 6 5 days ago Reply Liam Ke Yes. 0 3 days ago Reply wpbazaar Nup.

Microsoft keeps moving the development model/sdk/api/tooling landscape.

Besides if you plan to make an app that you can't finish in a few month, you can't reserve the name in advance, since it is only protected one year. That my be one of the problem that so many not quite finished apps hit the store. The developer has to published finished or not befor one year. And when it is published and don't be a hit (maybe because it not really finished), then the developer looses intrest in it. Not all can afford to quit they job to work fulltime on an app. For most of us it a parttime thing. One thing I really miss when working with XAML is the ability to use % just as we do in HTML.

I did look at alternatives for things like mocking for unit tests, but they were either rather expensive commercial products, or, in the case of the mocking frameworks, the free components that were able to get around the "reflection emit" issue were, for me, simply inadequate. While some breaking changes are to be expected in making a change like migrating from "classic" .Net to UWP, if Microsoft really want all Windows developers to embrace the "new way of doing things" then expecting them to throw away significant portions of their existing core code because it was designed to work with components that don't (or can't) support UWP is going to deincentivise the case for bothering with a UWP version.  Though many of these components aren't under the direct control of Microsoft, and who knows why many of them haven't been upgraded to .Net Standard, for example, it wouldn't hurt for Microsoft to "encourage" them to be upgraded to help boost the case for UWP app development.  Besides, at a personal level, I don't really care if Microsoft or someone else made a particular component I use in my applications: if I can't get it to work in a UWP application then I'm more likely to conclude that UWP is way too much hassle and I'd be better off sticking to "classic" .Net (and yes, I am aware of the Centennial app bridge). 1 5 days ago Reply AgentTheGreat But honestly, what is the point of developing UWP instead of, say, WPF with "classic" .NET? We hear a lot of "it runs on phones, XBOX, HoloLens" etc. but Windows phones are nowhere to be found, XBOX is a gaming console and HoloLens is simply vaporware. You'd trade a rich set of tried and true APIs and Frameworks for...what exactly? BTW HoloLens reminds me of the original "Surface table" that excited lots of people (myself included) just to go into oblivion. Microsoft has a "vision" always in words. If you've seen any push in the direction of this vision, show me. All I've seen so far is trading of truely powerful sofware for their weak counterparts - like Windows Media Player with the "mobile" Groove Music and WP8 with W10M. By the time HoloLens gets up and running (if it ever does) the competition is very likely to get there with something of their own, and they are in the right place too: imagine an Android augmented reality headset that runs apps just like HoloLens does;  Augmented reality isn't really for content creation but mostly entertainment and collaboration and these categories are a good fit for mobile apps instead of something like Photoshop. So Google and Apple can pretty easiy release HoloLens-esque headsets and jump in the game. I'm sorry. But it seems to me that with all this fumbling of ideas Microsoft puts them on the path to oblivion in the consumer space. 3 4 days ago Reply Random DS If I buy a mini PC, hook it up to my TV, connect an IR airmouse, and enable tablet mode (because having multiple windows on your TV is pointless 99% of the time), does it still count as a desktop?

If I want to argue the other way around: the iPhone was just an iPod with technology "stolen" from the likes of Nokia to make it a phone. So this line of reasoning is invalid and Surface IS redefining the PC with sales of laptops dropping and hybrids gaining ground. Again, it was about living off a legacy.

I'm holding out hope for the Surface phone lol. 0 5 days ago Reply Robin Capper The problem with UWP is, although technically universal, it isn't universal. Even Microsoft won't sell me a decent Windows Phone these days so the mobile, primary, platform is missing.
