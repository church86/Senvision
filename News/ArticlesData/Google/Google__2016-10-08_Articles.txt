The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are now available in India - we saw lines forming outside Apple stores for the 7pm launch on Friday, showing that there's a fair amount of demand for these handsets in India. The iPhone 7 price starts at Rs. 60,000 and the iPhone 7 Plus starts at Rs. 72,000, but there are still plenty of deals you can go for to get a slightly cheaper phone. Aside from the new iPhone models, the Apple Watch series 2 is now available in India as well, from Rs. 32,000 onwards.Apart from the various e-commerce deals, Airtel and Reliance Jio are also giving special offers for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Airtel's infinity plan is offering users 120GB of free 4G data, while Jio's iPhone offer gives users 12 months of free services including 20GB of data per month, and access to Jio services - a total bundle that the company pegs at being worth Rs. 18,000 for the year's use. Airtel has another offer where it is iPhone 7 at Rs. 19,990 and you can check out all the details here. Our own review of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be coming soon, but first impressions have been very positive. You can also see exactly what all is inside the package you get through these unboxing photographs, or see the video below. A word of caution for all prospective buyers - the phone does not come with a 3.5mm audio jack - something that worried people into being willing to try anything. Including being fooled by a viral video that tricked them into drilling into their brand new phones. Don't drill holes into your phone, and instead check out our picks for alternatives you can use with your new iPhone.

The Pixel phones will be up for pre-order in India from next week, with the smaller Pixel being available at Rs. 57,000, while the Pixel XL starts at Rs. 66,000. The two phones are identical on all fronts except for the battery and screen - the Pixel has a 5-inch screen while the Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch screen. Both phones are powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, with two cores clocked at 1.6GHz, and two cores clocked at 2.15GHz. Both the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will pack 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and sport Pixel imprint fingerprint sensor. They sport a 12.3-megapixel rear camera with a Sony IMX378 sensor, PDAF, f/2.0 aperture, and 1.55-micron pixels. Both sport an 8-megapixel front camera with a Sony IMX179 sensor, an f/2.4 aperture, and 1.4-micron pixels. The two phones also have some software tweaks that are exclusive for now, including early access to things such as Google Assistant and Android 7.1, and some features that will not trickle down, such as free, unlimited backup for pictures and videos.

(Also see: Google Pixel vs iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge) Google also announced the launch of the new Chromecast Ultra, Google Home, Google Wifi, and Google Daydream View. Apart from the iPhone, we saw another high profile phone launch in India this week - the Moto Z and Moto Mods. The phone was first launched in June but the global rollout started in September. Now, the phone has launched in India, with a starting price of Rs. 39,999. The cheaper Moto Z Play starts at Rs. 24,999. You'll be able to buy the phones from October 17, along with the Moto Mods - modular components that can dramatically add features to your phone. The Moto Mods connect to your phone via the 16-dot connector interface, and a number of them are going to be available in India. The JBL Soundboost costs Rs. 6,999, the Moto Insta-Share Projector costs Rs. 19,999, the Hasselblad True Zoom costs Rs. 19,999, the Incipio offGRID Power Pack costs Rs. 5,999, the Wood and Ballistic Nylon Motorola Style Shell costs Rs. 1,099, while the Leather Style Shell costs Rs. 1,599. These will all be available with a slight discount if you buy them with the phone. Other launches this week included the Lyf Wind 4S with 4000mAh battery and the Lyf Flame 7S with a 4-inch display. There was also the Asus ZenPad Z10 tablet with a 9.7-inch display and 4G LTE support. The Zen Cinemax Force also launched this week as did the Oppo F1SDiwali Edition that comes with a redesigned rear panel and Diwali theme. The Intex Aqua Strong 5.2 with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage also launched, and the Vivo Y55L with a 5.2-inch display. Sony also launched two premium cameras, the A6500 and Cyber-Shot RX100 V. The week also saw the big online sales coming to an end, with Flipkart, Snapdeal, and Amazon all reporting great sale numbers. Flipkart says customer saved over Rs. 1000 crore during its Big Billion Days Sale, while Amazon registered strong growth in mobile shoppers and Prime subscribers. Snapdeal says it saw total number of shoppers increase four times in the sale. The latest round of spectrum auctions also concluded this week, falling short of its target by a large margin. The auction began on October 1, with the goal of shoring up gaps in spectrum holdings, and Telecom Secretary J S Deepak said the next such sale may not happen for "quite some time". However, on day 2 the auction appeared to slow down and on day 3 the auction for the 700MHz and 900MHz bands saw no takers. These 4G bands continued to be ignored by operators on day 4, and on the final day the 900MHz band still saw no takers. (Also see: What Is Spectrum, and Why Is It Being Auctioned?) Aside from this, another interesting event this week was Oculus Connect 3, Facebook's virtual reality event. Facebook is making a Web browser for VR and it showed off a lot of developments from Oculus. It showcased the Oculus Touch motion controllers, which will be available from December, and finally brought up room-scale VR, which is a pretty big development. The company also talked about a VR device that fits between the PC-powered Oculus Rift and the mobile-powered Gear VR. At OC3, Facebook talked about a standalone device that would offer experiences somewhere between these two extremes, with inside-out positional tracking. Zuckerberg also showed off Oculus Rooms and the concept of "social VR", as he showed a demo of people hanging out, holding a conference, and watching movies together using the Oculus platform. And in news you're not likely to believe - a Nokia phone saved a man's life as it stopped a bullet. And no, it wasn't the old unbreakable seeming models either, but a modern Nokia featurephone. This is actually not the first time that a Nokia phone achieved this feat. In 2014, a Nokia Lumia 520 stopped a bullet fired at a Brazilian policeman, though the handset – predictably – got destroyed in the process.

On the plus side, Google has made some fantastic (review pending) phones that can easily stand toe to toe with any flagship out there. With a premium look and feel and specs to match, Google has now joined the OEM community with a very strong entry. And with that strong entry comes a strong price tag. The Pixel phones are pricey. A base model costs the same as a base model iPhone, and a base model Galaxy S7. Gone are the days when Google could be counted on to release a good phone with a great price. But looking at the landscape these days, I’m not so sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. Now, it’s true that I wrote a few days ago that Google picked the wrong time to make an expensive phone. But that was based solely on the concept of price. Let’s look at the bigger picture. Stock or die Google has built a bit of a reputation for bringing good phones to the market to serve as a showcase of how Android “should be”. In a world of Android skins ranging from Touchwiz to EMUI, Google needs a showcase of Android as it is intended to be. Developers rely on a stock Android experience with fast updates to make sure their apps continue to function properly with updates as they’re released. There’s a reason Developer Previews are made available early – so when Android O comes out, the fit doesn’t hit the shan. So can developers really be expected to pick up hardware costing over $600 to develop their free face switcher app? That seems a bit much. On iOS, a developer can pick up an iPhone 6 for a couple of Benjamins. They can count on the fact that their app will run pretty much the same on it as it does on an iPhone 7. So what’s an Android Dev to do? Strong competition But more than that, and to be fair I’ve already made this argument in my other article so I’m not going to repeat every point here, but with so many great sub-$400 phones out there, why is Google suddenly upping its price game? The current crop of smartphones out there seems to be right in Google’s wheelhouse, but instead it’s swinging for the fences. That doesn’t make any sense And yet… Until you consider what Google’s ultimate goal might be here. Maybe Google isn’t competing against other midrange phones because it doesn’t want to compete against midrange phones. Maybe Google is focusing on developing a consumer product, rather than a developer product. If that’s the case, suddenly Google’s specs and price points make a heck of a lot more sense. Plus, let’s consider the fact that the Nexus line of phones hasn’t always been so low priced. Starting the with the Nexus 6 and moving forward to the 5X and the 6P, we haven’t really been seeing a lot of super low prices. The Nexus 5 may have been the last of that line. Anecdotally, when I look around, I see a lot more Nexus 5X and 6P phones around than I’ve ever seen previous Nexus phones. The consumer world has taken notice of Google’s offerings and started to buy them. It makes sense that Google would want to up its game in that arena. Going home Plus, the Pixel phone is Google’s first hardware showcase for Google Assistant, which is the direction Google wants to go. Sundar Pichai said he wants to create a personal Google for everyone in the world, and Google Assistant is a means to do so. With devices like the Google Home coming out to complement Google Assistant, Google’s initial offering to consumers has to be a consumer product – not a phone for techies and geeks, lest that the be extent of Google Assistant’s usefulness. Google Assistant is a mostly untested product, but Google seems to have a lot riding on it. To hamstring the service by offering it on a midrange phone when most people are running to Samsung and Apple, would make the service pretty much DOA. At least now with the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google can make a solid case to pick up its phone with Google Assistant, rather than the Note 7 which comes with a built in hand warmer. Oh no he didn’t. Oh yes he did. Sound off So what do you think? Is Google shooting itself in the foot with these lofty prices? Or is Google simply switching its focus from developers to consumers, and adjusting its strategy to match? Now, don’t be salty that the phone costs a lot – it’s easy to do. But focus on the big picture here, let me know what you think in the comments, and let’s see if we can figure this out. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 9, 2016 at 11:22AM Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows and Office cash cows once made it the top dog of the tech world. But that heyday, which lasted through most of the 1990s and early 2000s, ended when it missed the market shift toward mobile devices. That's why analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively rise just 2% and 4% this year. Image source: Microsoft. But under CEO Satya Nadella, who succeeded Steve Ballmer in early 2014, Microsoft made sweeping changes to counter its biggest headwinds -- sluggish PC sales, OS fragmentation, a poor mobile presence, and weakness in its cloud ecosystems. Let's discuss Microsoft's latest strategies to overcome each of these challenges. Weak PC sales and OS fragmentation In the past, Microsoft relied heavily on sales of Windows and Office licenses for PC users. However, sales of PCs have fallen year-over-year for seven consecutive quarters, according to Gartner, due to longer-lasting hardware and an increasing dependence on mobile devices. Meanwhile, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) popularized free operating systems. Google and Apple both take a cut of app store sales within their free operating systems -- which generates more stable long-term revenue than a one-time license fee. Since a new license was required for every Windows upgrade, many users simply stuck with older, "good enough" versions. That's why Windows 7 remains the most popular PC OS with a 48% share of the market, compared to a 23% share for Windows 10. That fragmentation means that Microsoft must keep supporting outdated operating systems, and that newer features (like Cortana) might only reach a fraction of its users. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft addressed these headwinds by making Windows 10 a free year-long upgrade for most users, and tethered PCs, mobile devices, and Xbox Ones to a universal app store. The Windows Store remains much smaller than Google Play and the App Store, but it's an encouraging step toward generating revenue from apps instead of paid OS licenses. To counter similar problems with Office licenses, Microsoft pivoted toward Office 365, which runs on a cloud-based subscription model. Earlier this year, Gartner reported that Office 365 was more popular than Google Apps among large enterprise customers. Weakness in mobile and cloud ecosystems If Microsoft had a viable mobile OS, the slowdown in PC sales wouldn't be as challenging. Unfortunately, Windows Phone controlled just 0.4% of the global smartphone market in the second quarter, according to IDC. Android and iOS respectively controlled 87.6% and 11.7% of the market. The lack of a mobile platform makes it hard for Microsoft to expand cloud-based features like Bing Search and Cortana. Without users feeding data to those services, the overall usefulness of its cloud platform Azure as an analytics tool declined. In response, Microsoft reduced the number of smartphones it would launch every year, and pivoted toward launching major apps like Office 365, OneDrive, Bing, and Cortana on iOS and Android. It even forged partnerships with numerous Android OEMs to pre-install those apps on their devices. Microsoft is also trying to blur the lines between mobile devices and PCs with new Surface 2-in-1 devices and Continuum, a Windows 10 feature which converts Windows 10 Mobile devices into full desktop PCs. By doing so, Microsoft is leveraging its strength in PCs (particularly among larger enterprise customers) to promote the idea of an "all in one" device to replace the smartphone, tablet, and PC. Continuum. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft is also gathering more data from its users than before with Windows 10. That practice was criticized by privacy advocates, but it's arguably necessary to get the OS, Cortana, Bing, Azure, and other Microsoft platforms onto the same cloud-based page. To do so, it recently merged the Microsoft Research and Information Platform Groups with the Bing, Cortana, robotics, and ambient computing teams to create the new AI and Research Group. That team will infuse Microsoft's apps with AI features (like Skype translate), develop new features with facial recognition and machine analytics, and expand the company's cloud infrastructure to "build the world's most powerful supercomputer with Azure." In other words, Microsoft wants to expand its cloud ecosystem to counter Google's, while helping Azure close the gap with Amazon's market-leading AWS (Amazon Web Services). But will these strategies pay off? Microsoft still has a long way to go before it can catch up to Google, Apple, and Amazon in the mobile and cloud platform markets. Nonetheless, Nadella's forward-thinking strategies are arguably superior to the complacent tactics that came before, and could gradually offset Microsoft's outdated dependence on PC sales and licensing fees.

Unlike the conservative (but cheap) Google device, this new headset does have full movement sensing, and it bridges the gap between smartphone-based VR headsets and dedicated home VR headsets (such as Rift). We predicted the rise of these “dedicated portable VR headsets” in our VR headset forecast. At Oculus’s developer conference this week, the firm sought to regain momentum after a number of recent setbacks, including unfortunate publicity around founder Palmer Luckey’s political funding, shock at the leaked price of the Touch controllers, and the HTC Vive allegedly being favoured by developers. In among the Touch demos, reduced PC-spec requirements, and new content announcements was an intriguing demo of a tetherless headset (known as “Santa Cruz”) not requiring a smartphone – in Ovum’s VR headset forecast, we dubbed such headsets “dedicated portable VR headsets” and predicted a rosy future for them. While no actual product was announced, it will be interesting to see how this headset stacks up against those based on Intel’s Alloy design, Sulon’s long-awaited headset, and the raft of devices inbound from Chinese manufacturers (all dedicated portable headsets). Done right, Oculus’s experience of movement and positional tracking for the Rift should put it in good standing to provide a better experience than those attempting their first device. The downside of this headset type remains cost vs. performance; it won’t be as powerful as a full Rift or Vive, but it will have to include expensive dedicated components normally provided by a smartphone in the cheap Daydream View headsets.

By Christian de Looper — October 5, 2016 1:00 PM Subscribe to this topic Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Google has finally unveiled the long-awaited and heavily rumored Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL smartphones, boasting some of the best specs in the business, as well as heavy Android integration, a top-notch camera, and more. In fact, these phones have the specs to match up against any flagship device out there. But how do the two new phones compare to each other? Are there any advantages to one over the other? We put the two new Google phones head to head to find out. Related: Pixel phones, Daydream, Home — oh my! Everything Google revealed at its October 4 event Performance Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Size 5.6 x 2.7 x 0.2-0.3-inches (143.8 x 69.5 x 7.3-8.5mm) 6.0 x 2.9 x 0.2-0.34-inches (154.7 x 75.7 x 7.3-8.5mm) Weight 143g (5.0 oz) 168g (5.93oz) Screen 5.0-inch AMOLED 5.5-inch AMOLED Resolution 1,080 x 1,920 pixels (441ppi) 1,440 x 2,560 pixels (534ppi) OS Android 7.1 Nougat Android 7.1 Nougat Storage 32/128GB 32/128GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 RAM 4GB 4GB Connectivity GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE Camera 12MP rear, 8MP front 12MP rear, 8MP front Video 2,160p at 30fps 2,160p at 30fps Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer Accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer Water resistant No No Battery 2,770mAh 3,450mAh Ports USB-C, headphone jack USB-C, headphone jack Marketplace Google Play Google Play Color offerings Very Silver, Quite Black, Really Blue Very Silver, Quite Black, Really Blue Availability Google Play, Verizon Google Play, Verizon Price Starts at $650 Starts at $770 DT review Coming soon Coming soon As it turns out, there’s really very little comparison to make. Both the Pixel and Pixel XL feature Qualcomm’s latest and great mobile processor, the Snapdragon 821, as well as 4GB of RAM and options for either 32GB or 128GB of storage. Those certainly aren’t bad specs at all. The Snapdragon 821 is around 10 percent faster than the already-fast Snapdragon 820, ensuring that all those apps you install over the next few years continue to run smoothly and without a hitch. When it comes to RAM, it’s potentially another story. There are indeed phones out there with a hefty 6GB of RAM, like the OnePlus 3, however, that doesn’t necessarily mean faster or better performance — just look at the iPhone. While it has traditionally had less RAM, because of how deeply software and hardware are integrated, the iPhone outperforms almost all others on the market. Both Google Pixel phones are shaping up to be very high performers, but they’re about as powerful as each other — there’s no winner here. Winner: Tie Design There’s also no winner in the design department. The phones feature an identical look, except the Pixel XL is a little larger. The overall look of the phone certainly isn’t bad at all. It features a relatively premium look, that’s slightly off compared to other flagship devices. That’s largely because of the fact that half of the back is made from a metal body, while the top half of the back is made from glass — that’s the half with the fingerprint sensor and the camera. The glass does make the phone look unique, but it also looks a little like plastic, slightly detracting from the perceived quality of the device. Related: Hands on: Google Pixel and Pixel XL On the bottom of the phone, you’ll find a USB-C port and two slots. Don’t mistake those for stereo speakers — it seems like one of them is a speaker and the other a microphone slot. It’s nice that they look the same though, as it contributes to the phone’s symmetry. On the left edge, you’ll find the SIM tray, and on the right, you’ll find both the power buttons and the volume rocker. On the back, as is expected, you’ll find the fingerprint sensor, as well as the camera, which is relatively small and located in the top left-hand corner of the back. In general, the phone looks nice, if not slightly odd. Still, there’s obviously no winner, since they’re identical. You can get both in silver, black, and blue. Winner: Tie Battery Finally, something we can actually compare. The battery capacity on the Pixel is 2,770mAh, while that of the Pixel XL sits at 3,450mAh. Still, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that the extra battery merely powers the larger display for the same amount of time. Google, however, rates the Pixel XL as having a much longer battery life — it says the device can last as long as 32 hours of talk time, compared to the standard Pixel’s 26 hours. That’s an extra 6 hours, which is no small figure. Both devices also feature quick charging, which gives them as much as 7 hours of use through only 15 minutes of charging. Unfortunately, neither offer wireless charging. With the much longer battery capacity, the Pixel XL is the clear winner. Winner: Google Pixel XL Display The battery isn’t the only thing that’s different between the two phones — the display also offers a point of difference. Both displays are AMOLED, however the display on the Pixel XL is a little larger — and boasts a higher resolution. While the display on the Google Pixel is 5-inches and has a resolution of 1,080 x 1,920 pixels, the Pixel XL takes things a step further by offering a 5.5-inch display with a resolution of 1,440 x 2,560 pixels. Even with the larger size, the Pixel XL’s display is sharper, boasting 534 pixels-per-inch compared to the Pixel’s 441ppi. There’s a clear winner here, and that’s the Google Pixel XL. Winner: Google Pixel XL Camera The camera is identical on the two phones, and according to Google, it’s a good one. The rear-facing camera is 12 megapixels with an aperture of f/2.0, and while that may not technically offer as great low-light photos as other cameras, Google says the camera is the best smartphone camera ever built. Obviously, that remains to be seen once reviews start coming out, but its a good sign nonetheless. Of course, those low-light shots are also aided by the relatively large 1.55µm pixel size, which is able to draw in more light than other cameras with smaller pixel sizes, so the camera’s performance in low-light situations remains to be seen. Related: Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7: Which 5-inch flagship is right for you? On the front of the device, you’ll find an 8-megapixel shooter, which is a far higher resolution than most front-facing cameras. That’s nice for the selfie-lovers out there, although it’s nice to have even for those that aren’t that into selfies. Even better — all those photos you take can be backed up for free to Google Photos in original quality. Winner: Tie Software Both of the phones will ship with Android 7.1 Nougat, which is Google’s latest version of Android. The operating system has all the great new features found in Android 7.1, as well as a few more. The most notable? Google Assistant integration. Google Assistant is Google’s latest and greatest digital assistant, aimed at creating a “conversation” between users and Google. Assistant isn’t just a great way to interact with Google services — it’s also a great way to integrate with third-party apps, as Google is allowing third-party integration through “Actions on Google.” Apart from Assistant, the new version of Android also brings features like Night Light, which changes the colors shown on the screen to show less blue light. Perhaps the coolest feature on the Pixel, however, is Daydream compatibility. Daydream turns your phone into a virtual reality device, and really takes things to the next level compared to systems like Google Cardboard. Thankfully, if you pre-order the Pixel, you’ll also get a Daydream View headset for free so you can try out Daydream without having to pay anything extra. Related: Where to buy everything Google announced at its October 4 event You’ll also get automatic software updates, which is awesome. No other Android phone will get new versions of Android or security patches faster than the Pixel phones. Winner: Tie Price and availability While the Pixel XL offers a better display and a higher battery life, those things obviously come at a price — the Pixel XL costs $120 more than the standard Google Pixel. Apart from pricing, there’s an availability issue — the Pixel and Pixel XL are currently only available at Verizon, or you can get them unlocked. We recommend you buy them unlocked from Google, no matter your carrier. That way, you won’t have to be stuck with a carrier for two years. The Pixel and Pixel XL can both be pre-ordered now, with shipping expected in 2-3 weeks. Here’s a quick rundown of pricing. Pixel 32GB Pixel 128GB Pixel XL 32GB Pixel XL 128GB Verizon $650, $27.08 per month for 24 months $750, $31.24 per month for 24 months $770, 32.08 per month for 24 months $870, $36.24 per month for 24 months Google Store $650, $27.04 per month for 24 months $750, $31.21 per month for 24 months $770, $32.04 per month for 24 months $870, $36.21 per month for 24 months Winner: Pixel Winner: Pixel XL Obviously, the Google Pixel XL is the “better” phone, but the better battery and display resolution don’t come free. If you’re really into the larger screen or want a longer battery life, then you’re going to have to shell out the extra cash — but if not, there’s good news: you can get a phone with nearly equally good specs at a cheaper price. Both the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are shaping up to be great phones. Stay tuned for full reviews, but in the meantime, you can check out our hands-ons with them.

App gets rebranded as the… Goodbye, Google Cast! App gets rebranded as the more inclusive Google Home By Christian de Looper — October 5, 2016 2:53 PM Subscribe to this topic Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Google Cast is getting a rebrand. While the Chromecast first introduced us to the idea of casting, the concept has evolved with devices like Chromecast Audio and the ability to cast things to home speakers and other devices. Now, Google is rebranding the Google Cast app to be more inclusive of everything the app can do. The new name? Google Home. The rebrand certainly makes sense, especially with the advent of the Google Home device, which was launched at Google’s event on Tuesday, and offers some of the same features as other Google Cast devices. Related: Vizio debuts new SmartCast line of Google Cast-enabled sound bars This wasn’t exactly a big surprise — the latest Chromecast firmware already started referring to the app as Google Home. Now, it’s likely that the app will get a new interface enabling it to control other aspects of the smart home, as well as the new Google Home smart speaker, which was announced at Google’s event on Tuesday. It’s important to note that the concept of “casting” isn’t going away. While the Google Cast app will be rebranded, you’ll still use the casting technology to beam information to a device like the Chromecast or a home speaker. For example, you might find that a TV will be “cast-compatible.” Given the name change, Google will hopefully continue to work toward making the app a real hub for the smart home, perhaps by  incorporating other devices that may not be cast-compatible, like smart light bulbs, and including home automation. In fact, it would be great to see a Google-built alternative to apps like Yonomi, which automate the smart home and smart home devices. If the Cast app hasn’t been renamed on your device yet, it probably will be in the next few weeks. Right now, there aren’t any real changes to how the app actually works.

Google and Facebook are destined to wage a decade-long war for the future Business Insider 10/9/2016 Matt Weinberger © Provided by Business Insider facebook mark zuckerberg oculus vr priscilla Back in April, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled his grand ten-year roadmap, showing the company's trajectory from now through 2026.  Popular Searches Amgen Inc AMGN ▼ 149.04 -2.53 -1.67% Ampliphi Biosciences Corp APHB ▼ 0.9801 -0.1199 -10.90% Banc of California Inc BANC ▲ 13.90 +0.05 +0.36% Here's that slide again, in case you missed it: © Provided by Business Insider facebook f8 roadmap It points the way to Facebook's ideal future: A world where everybody's connected to the internet, where we talk to artificially intelligent computers as if they were human, and — boldest of all —  where virtual reality goggles are as common as our smartphones, allowing us to connect with people across the world as intimately as if they were in the same room. Facebook moved the marker on this ambitious roadmap a little bit forward this week, with more details on how the social network will operate in its ideal virtual reality future. In a demo, Zuckerberg showed off "Social VR," using a combination of the Oculus Rift headset and a 360-degree camera to mash together virtual reality and the real world like never before. In Facebook's vision for the year 2026, the social network plays a key role in more, if not most, of the interactions you have with your fellow humans. It's a little creepy, given how much Facebook already permeates our personal lives, but it provides a fascinating glimpse of the radical changes coming to the technology we use.   That's not to say it will be easy for Facebook.  Just this week, Google held its own big event. And while that presentation was ostensibly to introduce new hardware, it also gave us a glimpse of how Google is thinking about its own future — and the ways in which Facebook's 10-year strategy overlap with Google's. Their core businesses couldn't be more different — Facebook's efforts to break into search haven't yielded much result; Google's attempts to become a social network are pretty much Silicon Valley punchlines at this point. Yet in many important ways, Facebook and Google are already going punch-for-punch in a fight that won't be over any time soon. Fighting from the sidelines The most visible part of their fight: Google's YouTube is the undisputed ruler for web video. But Facebook has been working hard at undermining YouTube's supremacy by attracting more media brands and advertisers to its video offerings. But the more interesting competition is in the futuristic and far-reaching technology being developed by each tech giant.  Just this past week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the company is using artificial intelligence to "build a personal Google for each and every user." Facebook is investing heavily in AI to personalize its news feed, too. © Provided by Business Insider Sundar Pichai Facebook's Oculus subsidiary may have sparked the sudden gold rush towards virtual reality, but Google isn't far behind with its Daydream View headset, also announced this week. With VR movies projected to be big business, Google doesn't want to let Facebook steal YouTube's lead in video advertising. Google's parent company Alphabet and Facebook are both making huge investments in connecting the world. Facebook is using self-piloting laser drones, and Google is using balloons, but they share a self-given mission of connecting underserved populations to the internet.  © Provided by Business Insider Project Loon On all counts, these are very future-looking businesses. Artificial intelligence is a very young field, and virtual reality is a long ways away from hitting the consumer mainstream. Even those efforts to connect the globe have regulatory hurdles to overcome in many countries. It's early enough that these are all sidelines to what each company is really good at. But with a long enough timespan — say, 10 years — there are going to be winners in each field, and there are going to be losers. And each side is stockpiling as much engineering talent as it can to make sure that they're the ones who walk away from this. Daydream believer Ultimately, what this all comes down to is growth amid great technological change. Google and Facebook, both born in the weird period between the bursting of the first dot-com bubble and Silicon Valley's current startup boom, successfully navigated the transition from the PC to the smartphone. The way Google managed that change was largely thanks to Android itself: A smartphone operating system that had Google search and services baked in at every possible level, while also available on a whole range of low- and high-end phones for every possible demographic. Now, Android is the most popular operating system in the world, and Google profits. © Provided by Business Insider Facebook F8 2016 Facebook was slow transitioning from the PC to the smartphone, but quickly caught up and now sees the majority of its users and ad revenue on mobile.  But with the smartphone boom now grinding to a halt, the established businesses of the past decade are due for a shakeup and the hunt is on for the next big thing. Whatever it turns out to be — virtual reality, AI-powered assistants, or the like — Google and Facebook are both vying to repeat the Android trick and become indispensable to the next phase of technology. This isn't a battle that will be won with one product release, one new website design, or one app. It's a war that will be fought in fits and spurts in the years to come. But for the winner comes control over the future.  NOW WATCH: Google’s new VR headset is ‘squishy and very comfortable’ — here’s what it’s like Go to MSN Home More in Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY The world's most valuable stamps Lovemoney 6 Social Security changes coming in 2017 U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More From Business Insider Signs you're a stellar employee Business Insider Brands are using the US election to lure Americans to Canada Business Insider La Niña has officially arrived Business Insider Sears' suppliers fear the company is going bankrupt Business Insider Business Insider View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Now it's here. But it's got an unfamiliar moniker. James Martin/CNET Why the Pixel phone isn't called the Google Phone 0 Share: Mobile by Richard Nieva October 5, 2016 2:17 PM PDT @richardjnieva Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech It's finally here: the Google Phone. Well, not quite. It's officially called "Pixel, Phone by Google," and the search giant unveiled it Tuesday during a much-hyped event in San Francisco. The Pixel, available with either a 5-inch or 5.5-inch display, is a grown up Google phone, meant to compete with the top brass of the smartphone world, including Samsung and Apple. It's a sharp strategic shift for Google, which has until now been content with selling phones through its Nexus program. For that, Google farmed out some of the hardware design to other manufacturers -- like LG, Asus and Huawei -- who put their brands on the phone alongside Nexus. For tech watchers, the Pixel ends years of speculation about when Google would actually build a premium phone. The rumors started the moment Google bought a tiny mobile software startup called Android in 2005, a move that eventually pit it against Apple's iOS software for the iPhone. It prompted Apple's Steve Jobs to declare he was willing to spend every bit of his company's cash on fighting a "thermonuclear" war to destroy Android. The phone has Google's signature G on the back.Photo by James Martin/CNET So when Apple announced its own foray into the smartphone market in 2007 with the iPhone, we knew something was missing, an archrival. Coke has Pepsi, the Lakers have the Celtics, Tupac had Biggie. The iPhone needed a worthy competitor, someone even more formidable than Samsung, the world's biggest maker of phones. That's why a Google phone has been a long time coming. "When we finally decided to do it, everyone was like, 'What took you bozos so long?'" Brian Rakowski, a Google vice president of product management, said in an interview Tuesday. More on Pixel Google Pixel offers cold comfort to silent partner Google Pixel cautiously rolls dice with Verizon exclusivity Google Pixel makes a bid for Android history But dreams of this hypothetical clash of the tech titans typically envisioned the iPhone (a name that Apple bought from Cisco, by the way) fighting against the Google Phone. Or maybe the Gphone, as Android co-founder Andy Rubin called it in 2007. Something you could picture in lights on a marquee or in headlines on review face-offs. Instead, we got iPhone versus...Pixel. It's not exactly epic, like Superman versus Batman (the superheros, not the movie). Google insists Pixel is the right name for its new phone. "For us, it's always represented the best of hardware and software designed and built by Google," Rick Osterloh, Google's hardware chief, said on stage Tuesday. That's because Pixel isn't a new name. There are already Pixel Chromebook laptops and tablets that Google designed in-house. Rick Osterloh, Google's hardware chief, introduced the new phone.Photo by James Martin/CNET Still, it's pretty much an unknown brand. And that may be the point, said Dean Crutchfield, a New York-based brand consultant. For most people, Google means search. The Google name doesn't have the "panache" to carry a high-end phone. "The reason the phone isn't called Google is the brand doesn't stretch that far," he said. "If you stretch a brand too far, it snaps." Plus, Google thinks people will come to know it as "the Google phone" anyway, despite its proper name, a company spokeswoman said. She points out that it says "Phone by Google" on the box and the phone itself has a big G on the back. "Phone by Google" is also printed in teeny tiny, nearly illegible letters on the bottom of the back of the phone. "People know who built this phone," Rakowski continued. "It's quite clear. We're not being shy about it." A 'most-loved' brand Maybe you're thinking it's unimportant to dissect a name, that it's just semantics. Shakespeare wrote, "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet." But remember, Romeo and Juliet died because of their names. "When we finally decided to do it, everyone was like, 'What took you bozos so long?'" Brian Rakowski, Google vice president of product management Google knows better than anyone that branding and marketing matter. Just look at the ill-fated Google Glass, which failed because, among other things, the company couldn't get the story right as to why you'd spend $1,500 on awkward eyewear. If Google wants to go up against a heavyweight like the iPhone with this new phone -- and by all accounts, it does, given the Pixel's starting price of $650 and Google's exclusive deal with Verizon as the wireless provider -- then the company needs to nail everything, including the marketing. And the name. There are probably several reasons why the company wanted to call it something besides the Google Phone. Maybe Google didn't want to scare its hardware partners, which are still deeply important when it comes to Android, by jumping into the deep end with a full-on, branded phone. Or, if the phone is a flop, it would be tough to give it a second try with another Google phone if the company has already played that name card. Google made its own premium phone to showcase its software and services.Photo by James Martin/CNET Still, the Google name is a world-class asset. It's the most valuable brand in the world, according to the BrandZ Top 100 list, a study by the branding and advertising agency Kantar Millward Brown. Who's No. 2? Apple. And when it comes to the world's most-loved brands, Google is No. 4, according to the YouGov BrandIndex. Apple is close behind at No. 6. Interestingly enough, the study also lists the iPhone as its own brand. It's No. 8. Maybe Google hopes Pixel will join the list. The ranking suggests people tend to think good things when they hear Google. What do people think when they hear Pixel? Maybe that Adam Sandler movie that got a 16 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and 27 on Metacritic. But if Google didn't choose Pixel because Pixel could help its brand power, it could be the other way around, said Jan Dawson, CEO of Jackdaw Research. "If Google does a phone named Pixel, and it's successful, then it makes Pixel successful," he said. Or maybe there's something more subliminal at work here. A pixel, literally, is a kind of unit of measurement for images on a screen. On phones, pixels are the building blocks of software as manifested on a display. And software has always been at the heart of Google. So even though you're holding a shiny rectangle in your hand with Google's signature G on the back, Google wants to remind you that it's in the business of software. Pixels, not atoms. And in fact, that's how Google executives, standing under a digital banner that declared "Made by Google," explained it on Tuesday when they discussed why it's time for Google to make its own hardware: Software and data are bigger parts of people's lives than ever. Said Osterloh: "The rise of volume and complexity of all the information makes it so that this is the right time to be focused on hardware and software."

After decades of false promises, last week marked a moment when virtual reality began to set in. A new headset from Google, big investments by Facebook-owned Oculus and this week’s release of Sony’s much-anticipated headset in stores worldwide are boosting the VR industry just as the holiday shopping season arrives. “The progress we have seen across all the technology companies — Samsung, Google, HTC, Sony, Facebook — is mind boggling,” said Jeremy Bailenson, founding director of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, in an email. “I have seen more technological progress in the past two years than in the previous 15 combined in the VR space,” he said. “This holiday season I will be getting ‘VR’ on wish lists from relatives. That in and of itself is amazing.” Although it’s too soon to tell how far the momentum will drive revenue, virtual reality companies hope consumers get hooked by the kind of eye-popping experiences expressed by these Twitter members: Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP Google’s Cardboard viewer makes VR affordable for smartphone users. Google’s Cardboard viewer makes VR affordable for smartphone users. “Last night, I experienced VR for the first time ... and now I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s incredible,” tweeted Stephanie Zuppo. “I spent 15 minutes in VR for my first time today. Amazing, and half as nauseating as expected. Game changer #lateadopter,” tweeted Tyler Finck. “It’s hard to not think that everybody would have that excitement after they try it,” said Chad Dezern, studio director at Insomniac Games, which is releasing an Oculus video game called “The Unspoken.” “Of course, we don’t know, but we’re all hopeful at this point,” Dezern said. Work on virtual reality technology, which envelops a viewer in a visual and audio experience that comes close to replicating a real-world experience, has been a decades-long journey, and it’s far from over. Juniper Research projects there will be a $50 billion worldwide market for VR hardware in 2021. Retailers, hotel managers and even the U.S. Navy, which allowed San Franciscans to virtually experience aiding special forces under enemy fire last week in a Fleet Week special, are exploring how to use the technology for marketing. With its significant hardware and software requirements, VR proved too costly and difficult to reach a wide consumer audience until 2012, when startup Oculus VR raised $2.5 million in a Kickstarter campaign to develop a somewhat affordable head-mounted viewer. Today, Oculus’ headset, called the Rift, costs $600. Just after Sony unveiled plans for its PlayStation VR viewer in 2014, Facebook bought Oculus for more than $2 billion. Following that, Google released a cheap Cardboard viewer that works with smartphones, Oculus teamed with Samsung to create the $99 Gear VR viewer, and smartphone maker HTC worked with software developer Valve to make the $800 HTC Vive headset. The Rift and Vive both went on sale this year, while Samsung released an updated version of the Gear VR, which went on sale in late 2015. Last week, Google announced the Daydream View, a $79 VR headset that operates on the tech giant’s own virtual reality platform and will work with some forthcoming Android phones. Then at Oculus Connect 3, the company’s annual developers conference, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Oculus is working on a mid-range viewer that would be a cut above the Gear VR, but below the Rift. He also pledged another $250 million to support development of VR games and other content. Oculus will ship hand controllers in December. Those controllers add to the realism of a VR game such as “The Unspoken,” which gives the illusion a wizard’s fireball-making hands are your own. Meanwhile, Sony’s $399 PlayStation VR headset goes on sale Thursday, with more than 30 games available now and 20 more by year’s end. Sony is hoping that many of the 40 million owners of PlayStation 4 game consoles, required to run the headset, will step up to VR. Gartner research director Brian Blau, who has closely followed the industry since 1988 as a college researcher, VR startup co-founder and analyst, has remained skeptical about the industry’s future because he’s witnessed many false starts. But Blau called last week “a seminal moment in virtual reality.” “Clearly, there’s a lot of excitement and a lot of interest,” he said. “It’s also clear there are challenges. But it’s going to be hard to look back at this week and say anything other than it was a significant transitionary week. This is the first time when people can go to the store or go online, buy VR, get it home and experience it.” Blau’s onetime business partner, Tony Parisi, now co-founder of San Francisco VR mapping startup FormVR, said he’s been waiting 21 years for this moment and believes “there’s too much momentum now.” If headsets like the PlayStation VR “have a less than stellar showing, it might be of concern, but there are just so many people investing in this, coming from so many industries,” Parisi said. “It’s not just tech pushing it.” More by Benny Evangelista Oculus, Zuckerberg announce $250 million VR investment Warriors showcase VR with Andre Iguodala bobblehead New Sacramento Kings’ arena shows off latest in sports tech The future of robots: singing lullabies, testing motorcycles Sean White, senior vice president of emerging technologies for Firefox browser creator Mozilla, said his first VR project came in 1993, when the hardware and software cost millions and was only available to a few people. Now, White is working on Mozilla’s open-source project to make virtual reality projects easily shareable using a Web browser. “A decade ago, VR was something from a science fiction movie and nobody even heard about augmented reality,” he said. “People today all around the world have at least heard of them and many have experienced them. My hope is many more will.” In his Oculus Connect 3 keynote speech, Zuckerberg gave a nod to all of his competitors for advancing virtual reality. “This is happening at a little faster rate than any of us had really expected,” he said. “We’re here to make virtual reality the next major computing platform.” Stanford’s Bailenson wasn’t ready to go that far. “In terms of redefining all computing, I think we should take one step at a time,” he said. “What we know now is that VR — at consumer prices — provides a powerful and compelling experience. For a guy who has been studying this for decades, that is enough for me.” Benny Evangelista is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Duo is replacing Hangouts in Google's batch of preinstalled apps Instead of swapping Hangouts for Allo, Google is apparently more interested in pushing out a better video call experience than a messaging alternative. Derek Walter on 08 October, 2016 05:06 0 - - - - print email Allo may be the future of Google’s messaging efforts, but it’s Duo that will replace Hangouts as one of the preinstalled options on future Android phones. An email about the change recently went out to partners that install Google Mobile Services on their phones. This is distinct from the Android Open Source Project, as enabling these services means agreeing to a license with Google that your phone will include this distinct bundle of apps. Basically, all devices with the Google Play Store are “Google Mobile Services” licensees, while other devices that have their own app stores don’t use the Google Mobile Services agreement. We rarely see those products here in the U.S., but Amazon’s Fire tablets are the most popular example. According to the message details, Google is dropping Hangouts from the list of apps that must be bundled on upcoming phones. Today, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016. It sounds like the earlier indication that Hangouts would pivot to an enterprise function is coming to be. The curious change is that it’s Duo, not Allo, that’s become the replacement. Google must see video calling as the more pivotal market right now, a function that has often been lackluster for Hangouts. Pushing out Duo puts a FaceTime competitor to everyone who buys a future Android phones, enabling them to easily video chat with friends or family members across Android and iOS. Why this matters: Duo is clearly the cool kid now when it comes to Google’s messaging efforts. I’d expect Allo to get similar bundling treatment at some point, especially since the company faces stiff competition from several messaging apps that are already hugely popular. Until then, it’s up to you to grab it from the Play Store. Brand Post Top 10 Things to Love about Surface Pro 4 More from Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located.

As we previously discussed, Tesla’s Autopilot miles are not really equivalent to Google’s self-driving miles, but it still gives us a good indication of the speed at which each company is deploying their semi-autonomous and autonomous programs. Now Google is about to speed up its effort by deploying a lot more vehicles through its partnership with Fiat-Chrysler to build a fleet of self-driving Pacifica, Chrysler’s new plug-in hybrid minivan. The first few prototypes were spotted in Mountain View over the weekend. Google is currently equipping a fleet of 100 Pacifica minivans with a new suite of sensors to test its self-driving system. The 100 prototypes will represent a significant addition to Google’s fleet which currently consists of only 24 Lexus Rx450h SUVs and 34 prototypes of its own design spread out in 4 cities: Mountain View, Kirkland, Phoenix, and Austin. The first 6 minivans arrived at one of Google’s facilities in Mountain View and the company already equipped two of them with sensor suites and installed mounting systems on others. With these new prototypes, Google is clearly trying to make its system more “commercialization-friendly”. The roof-mounted sensor suite is much smaller than the one on the Lexus Rx450h SUVs and the lidar sensor doesn’t stick out as much as on the small Google prototype car. In pictures by Mario Herger, CEO of Enterprise Garage (reprinted on 9to5Google with permission), you can actually see sensors embedded inside the front fenders which are particularly interesting: The new roof-mounted sensor suite is visibly a lot closer to the roof and features what appears to be radar antennas, lidar sensors and cameras. The Pacifica is offered with a plug-in hybrid option equipped with a 16 kWh battery pack which allows for an all-electric range of 30 miles, according to the automaker. When announcing the partnership, Google confirmed that the hybrid option was of interest to the company because of its “robust electrical architecture”. As Google deploys the new vehicles, the company is expected to rack up a lot more miles and get closer to finally commercializing its self-driving system – something it has been criticized for by former employees for not being in a hurry to do.

It’s with great regret that we forgot to credit them in the original as the source of the story. By now it should come as no surprise that Julian Assange isn’t a fan of Hillary Clinton. It doesn’t seem that he likes Google much, either. A new era of tech events has begun We’re back in New York this November for the 4th edition of our growth-focused technology event. Join us Assange, the notorious founder of Wikileaks, detailed plans to unleash a fresh batch of leaked documents  each week until the November 7 presidential election. The first of these leaks was due yesterday, but instead of documents intended to derail the Clinton campaign, we got a plug of Assange’s book and an echo of previous statements that the leaks would come once a week between now and the election. The documents are said to expose Clinton, the military, the oil industry, and Google. Seriously. Google. Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google and its current chairman seems to be the lynchpin in Assange’s new master plan. In an excerpt from his 2014 book ‘When Google Met Wikileaks,’ Assange accuses Schmidt of having ties to the State Department when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and working closely with her campaign. During this time, he reported, Google started to work more closely with the federal government. A passage from the book reads: Nobody wants to acknowledge that Google has grown big and bad. But it has. Schmidt’s tenure as CEO saw Google integrate with the shadiest of U.S. power structures as it expanded into a geographically invasive megacorporation. Assange’s tenure at the head of Wikileaks saw the company implicated in cable and email leaks that revealed company brass heading operations in Iran and Afghanistan. The latter saw executives attempting to move Afghani telecoms onto US military bases and the former uncovered meetings with Iranian leaders, according to Recode. These meetings were purportedly to assist US government interests. These leaks never seemed to affect Google, as the company continued to grow bigger and more powerful in the years to follow. Seemingly forgotten, the anti-Google feelings have since reemerged. Maybe it’s not unfounded. Schmidt does back a startup that provides a great deal of data for the Clinton campaign and Schmidt himself chairs a newly minted innovation board at the Pentagon. Compelling circumstantial evidence, but neither offers overwhelming evidence to support Assange’s claim. For now, we’ll just have to wait and see what Assange has up his sleeve. Correction: The original article incorrectly stated that Alphabet backed a startup that provides data for the Clinton campaign. It’s actually backed by Schmidt himself.  Here’s why Wikileaks’ Julian Assange wants to take down Google on Recode Read next: Samsung to purchase 'Viv' the AI assistant built by the creators of Siri GoogleTech Share on Facebook (796) Share on Twitter (435) Bryan Clark is a reporter from San Diego, CA.

With ID theft on the rise, South Africans have been warned to be more vigilant about how they share personal information online as criminals have become sophisticated in their phishing strategies. Following countless warnings about such cybercrime, it has become clear that our government could be (indirectly) helping the criminals with personal information through their communication tools such as the “Gazette”. To communicate with its citizens and actively encourage public participation, the Government publishes the Government Gazette, which usually includes detailed personal information ranging from physical addresses to identity numbers. Anyone who has interacted with a government department for business purposes, attended a conference, applied for an RDP house, or even applied for a title deed is compromised as their information has been published through the Gazette. This information can be retrieved through a simple Google search – a personal information breach of the highest form. The South African Fraud Prevention Association has stated that criminals use stolen ID documents, often changing the photograph to open fraudulent bank accounts, get credit and buy high-value items. This form of crime has increased by more than 200 percent in the last six years. The government has rightly identified this as a risk for its citizens and national security and tabled the PoPI Act in Parliament for the sole purpose of ensuring all South African institutions conduct themselves in a responsible way when collecting, processing, storing and sharing another entity's personal information by holding them accountable. The PoPI legislation considers personal information to be “precious goods” and therefore aims to restore certain rights of protection and the ability to exercise control over: When and how information is shared through consent. The type and extent of information shared. Transparency and accountability on how data will be used (limited to the purpose) and notification if/when the data is compromised. Providing access to personal information as well as the right to have data removed and/or destroyed should the owner so wish. Who has access to your information… There must be adequate measures and controls in place to track access and prevent unauthorised people, even within the same company, from accessing your information. How and where information is stored (there must be adequate measures and controls in place to safeguard information to protect it from theft, or being compromised). The integrity and continued accuracy of information (your information must be captured correctly and once collected, the institution is responsible to maintain it). PoPI info sourced: https://www.workpool.co/featured/popi/ So what does this have to do with me? Let me give you some classic examples where this can play an important part in you becoming a crime statistic. Stalker – by simply searching your name on Google, they can find information that you would not share with strangers, including your current residential address. Such information may be used to further traumatise you or even lead to devastating end results where you or your loved one is kidnapped for ransom and such events could even lead to fatalities. If you live in an urbanised area, the stalker can have a clear and undisturbed view through Google Street views and they can familiarise themselves with your place before they launch an attack. Targeted car hijacking – this can be easily achieved by using your ID to register on websites that check traffic fines online. These websites need basic information that can be faked and once you have loaded everything you can view traffic infringements that have your car make and clear picture. Remember, that since our government put your ID and current residential address out there criminals now know exactly where you live. They may pay you a visit, learn about your moves and finally make their move. Filtering their targets is easy. ID numbers show your age and names give them a sense of who they are targeting. For example, if you are a 42-year-old Johan Smith there's a good chance you drive the most-wanted car. Social engineering – in computer-related crimes or cybercrime. Social engineering is a technique used by hackers and non-hackers to get access to confidential information. With social engineering, attackers use manipulation and deceit. This time, they won't even have to call you; they can call your service provider and take over your accounts. In general, service providers ask for basic personal information to verify that they are speaking to the rightful owner of the account. Normally, they would ask for the ID number, current or previous residential address and e-mail address. This information is easy to get online. People share too much information on social networks and with a simple search “by names as per the Gazette” your social network profile may be popping up in a Google search. Since we have a dilemma of corrupt Home Affairs officials, anything is possible. They may reprint your ID from their homes’ operation centre using personal information that we publish on Gazettes and this can lead to problems. Ever received a call where the caller is asking for more information and banking details? Well just imagine if they read your ID number and residential address to you, the chances of trusting them would get higher because it is common to trust people who know a lot about you. I would like to give more examples, but I hope these few put you in the bigger picture. Here's a funny one from my own experience. Some time ago I was "persuading" a girl. We got along nicely, but she refused to reveal her age, as is usual with girls. I decide to search her name on Google. Surprisingly, her ID number and current residential address popped up in the search results! One day I sent her her ID number and residential address in the middle of our conversation and she freaked out. Well, she blocked me on WhatsApp and after some few hours she came back to life, asking me how did I know all her personal information. I even forgot my come-back trick, but in her mind I was the sickest stalker, even capable of murder. As adults we got over it. However, I've learnt a lesson and I hope she did too – never hide your age if you are a South African (just kidding). Crime investigation and prevention organisations can share more tricks used by criminals with your personal identification information to commit crime. Disclosure of personal information through the Gazette can lead to: house hijackings, deceased estate fraud, blackmail, kidnappings, human trafficking, registering cars that are used to commit crime in your name, and so on. What is an ID number, in actuality? The first six numbers are the birth date of the person in YYMMDD format, so my ID number starts with 820101. The next four are a gender, 5000 and above is male and below 5000 is female. So my ID number would have a number of 5000 or greater. The next number is the country ID, 0 is South Africa and 1 is not. My ID number will have 0 here. The second last number used to be a racial identifier but now means nothing. The last number is a check bit. Which verifies the rest of the number. So the complete ID number structure is: 820101(5000-9999)0XX Now let’s see how easy it is to get some ID numbers using the internet search engine Google. There are many ways to get results, but the simple one is to search by the last seven numbers of your ID number, ie “XXXX XXX” and adding the keyword Gazette. So the search string would be: Gazette “XXXX XXX” However, to date there is no sense of urgency from the government on the following, as the president has not announced the commencement of the PoPI Act, nor have details of the Information Regulator surfaced. It was anticipated that the PoPI commencement date would be towards the end of 2016, but no later than May 24, 2017. It is also speculated that perhaps the sophistication of such an act may be baffling and needs additional expertise to assist with implementation. Equally so, we call upon our government to exercise some urgency in this matter, as there may be some unintended consequences which include security breaches that range in severity – from terrorism to credit fraud. Citizens are the rightful owners of their personal security information, government is urged to amend the law and review the gazetting communications tools to restore integrity and respect to personal information. South Africa can no longer afford to be naive about the cybersecurity crimes that are a global phenomena; at the very least this threatens the core rights of citizens as protected by our constitution. • Mlangeni is an IT Systems Manager for a Johannesburg-based Information Technology, Security and Business Processes company   Most Viewed Property Business Directory Pictures Art work as therapy for young offenders November 1 2016 Crowded Pollsmoor conditions 'shocking' November 1 2016 More Multimedia Video Video: Bafana versus Nigeria September 12 2014 More Multimedia You are here: IOL / CapeTimes / 'I know where you live, stole your ID number' We like to make your life easier RSS feeds Subscribe to one of our feeds and receive instant news.

Almost every move by Apple, Google or Facebook is seen through the lens of offence or defence, either against each other or towards a nimbler startup trying to turn them into yesterday’s news. But as well as competing directly, these clashes between titans have manifested themselves collaterally into a series of ideological arguments. Take the battle between privacy and progress: Apple, for example, has taken a strict line on using customers’ information, while others are more relaxed, partly because their use of data has allowed them to make great strides in areas such as artificial intelligence. Another one of these religious splits has been in the idea of “open” against “closed” systems. The first is the idea that technology should be infinitely tweakable and free of bias. It is the libertarian foundation of the world wide web: democratic rather than dictatorial. Closed means that the technology is less flexible, that decisions are taken by those who know better, rather than letting the user run amok. It is authoritarian, if largely benevolent. Google Pixel: hands on review Play! 00:36 Those that worship at the altar of open include Wikipedia and Mozilla, which develops the Firefox web browser. At the other end of the spectrum are Nintendo, which has tightly controlled both its video game software and hardware, and Facebook, which rigorously controls how its users experience the social network. But it is the two biggest tech companies that best represent this divide. In the open corner is Google, which was born on and is dependent on the web, and dreams of indexing the entire world’s information for everyone. On the closed side is Apple, which is obsessively devoted to simplicity and as a result shields its users from having too many choices. Google’s Android mobile software, which runs on thousands of smartphones, is free and massively customisable. iOS, Apple’s operating system, runs on one mobile - the iPhone - and uniform across devices. One is open, one is closed, and that is how it has been since both existed. Until last week, at least. For on Wednesday, Google took a leap into the unknown by unveiling its first phone. The Google Pixel is intended to be a direct competitor to the iPhone (as the frequency of Google’s potshots at Apple during its presentation showed). At its heart is the Google Assistant, an artificial intelligence designed to respond to millions of voice queries and demonstrate the power of the company’s smarts. google biggest failures It is a rare foray into hardware for Google, which has traditionally left the job of making Android phones to other manufacturers such as Samsung, LG and HTC. This has served it fairly well, with Android accounting for four in five phones sold globally, so why do it, especially in 2016, as growth in smartphone sales peters out and innovation seemingly dries up? Partially, at least, the answer lies in frustration at the state of the equipment manufacturers that Android relies on. HTC is in dire financial straits, and others such as Sony are losing market share. Samsung also appeared to be in trouble a year ago, and although has enjoyed a rebound in sales recently, Google had made the decision to sell its own handsets by then (now that the Korean group has been thrown into turmoil by defective handsets, the decision looks tremendously prescient). The fastest growing phone makers are in China, where Android has no Google services due to the company’s blackout of the country. Google has also been frustrated at the endless tampering with Android by manufacturers, who have often promoted their own apps and relegating Google’s. It is partly why the company requires that its search engine and web browser be installed on any Android phone that wants to use the Google Play app store, a directive that has landed it in hot water with EU competition regulators. The history of Google Play! 02:31 The new Google Assistant software that features in the Pixel is a crucial element of the company’s future: computing is moving away from the web searches that make the majority of the company’s money and towards artificial intelligence that can talk and answer questions, so naturally Google is desperate to control this new channel. So ask yourself: if you were Google, and needed Assistant to be a success at this crucial juncture, would you leave it to unreliable third parties or take things into your own hands? Suddenly, being a little less open and (whisper it quietly), a little bit more like Apple, starts to look attractive. Control both the hardware and the software, and you can be sure that customers are getting what you intend them to. Google’s ambitions go beyond the phone: the internet giant is also set to release the Google Home, a voice-controlled smart speaker that also puts the company’s AI at its heart. The two products will work together as well as with the Chromecast, its internet TV device. Gradually, it is building an “ecosystem” of products, seamlessly tied together with its software: another strategy that Apple’s iPhone, iPad and Mac have used to great effect. While it will protest that it has not abandoned its open ideals, Google has taken a big leaf out of the Apple playbook.

These are the first smartphones made by Google inside and out, hence the company’s emphasis on the “Made by Google” branding. To drive that point home, the company is going to open a Made by Google pop-up store in New York later this month. Google’s biggest rivals – Apple and Microsoft – have massive permanent retail stores in New York City. Google hasn’t challenged them with a big retail space of its own but that might be a possibility down the road. Since this is going to be a pop-up store, it’s quite likely that this will be a temporary affair. It’s unclear right now for how many days this pop-up store will be operational and which products will be sold directly to customers. Google did unveil several new products alongside Pixel, including but not limited to a smart Wi-Fi router, a smart Home speaker, and a VR headset. The Made by Google pop-up store will be located at 96 Spring St in New York, 10012. The company’s website mentions that it’s “coming October 20.” Filed in Gadgets. Read more about pixel and pixel xl.

I couldn’t decide whether to write “Scary Google” or “Scary Good.” I’m certainly having both reactions after watching the Google press event on Tuesday that introduced their newest products. Let’s start by musing about the fact that Google, while lobbying the FCC hard to get set-top boxes disengaged from the cable operator for whom they are a necessity, is at the same time moving its own products “in house,” and deciding that they should build them themselves, a la Apple. The explanation of why: well they think they can do it better, they can control the quality better, and they can integrate the services better. Now all you have to do is listen to Brian Roberts give the same explanation why and how the Xfinity X1 set-top box has been such a success to understand, from a business or consumer benefit point of view, the FCC is just flat out going in the wrong direction! But I digress. The new Google phone, the Pixel, looks like a winner. The most important part is that it integrates the new Google Assistant, which is like Siri, or Cortona, or Alexa but with an added twist; it has all the computing power of Google and a decade of developing artificial intelligence behind it. To me the ability to integrate actions and execute on them is the key to making things simple, and simplicity is the key to keeping all but the few of us techno-geeks, happy. The Google Assistant is also, more importantly from our business point of view, baked into the new Google Home speaker device. As I have already written, this looks a bit like Amazon’s Alexa on steroids. I’ve already ordered one, and will let you know how it works when it arrives in November (it’s cheaper than the Amazon Echo) but the thing that fascinates me most is its ability to integrate with Google’s Chromecast devices (there’s a new one of those coming as well, 4K, HDR). The demonstration during the press rollout is worth watching. The Home device links to the Chromecast device and allows you to do things like ask for a particular program in a participating vendor (like Netflix’s) catalog and the with just a voice command the television starts showing you the program you asked for. Now that, in itself, is a real trick, but I foresee this as just the beginning. Google didn’t need the FCC to write all sorts of new rules to allow it to disaggregate product. That’s going to happen no matter what just by the inherent power that is being built into these devices and put in homes. Imagine not needing a remote control at all!  That’s where they are trying to go, and they will accumulate all the data on what you watch and what you are looking for through the voice controlled Google Home device. While there will be “turf wars” for a while (no Amazon Prime Chromecasting, for instance) I doubt that will last, particularly for cable folks. If you want to give your customers a premier experience, you are going to have to get on board, and I would say sooner rather than later. That’s why Google both scares me, and I am somewhat in awe of what they are doing. They appear to be darn good at it, and if these new devices work… well, it sort of suggests my title is correct the way it is; remember the film “The Blob?

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 9, 2016 at 11:22AM Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows and Office cash cows once made it the top dog of the tech world. But that heyday, which lasted through most of the 1990s and early 2000s, ended when it missed the market shift toward mobile devices. That's why analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively rise just 2% and 4% this year. Image source: Microsoft. But under CEO Satya Nadella, who succeeded Steve Ballmer in early 2014, Microsoft made sweeping changes to counter its biggest headwinds -- sluggish PC sales, OS fragmentation, a poor mobile presence, and weakness in its cloud ecosystems. Let's discuss Microsoft's latest strategies to overcome each of these challenges. Weak PC sales and OS fragmentation In the past, Microsoft relied heavily on sales of Windows and Office licenses for PC users. However, sales of PCs have fallen year-over-year for seven consecutive quarters, according to Gartner, due to longer-lasting hardware and an increasing dependence on mobile devices. Meanwhile, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) popularized free operating systems. Google and Apple both take a cut of app store sales within their free operating systems -- which generates more stable long-term revenue than a one-time license fee. Since a new license was required for every Windows upgrade, many users simply stuck with older, "good enough" versions. That's why Windows 7 remains the most popular PC OS with a 48% share of the market, compared to a 23% share for Windows 10. That fragmentation means that Microsoft must keep supporting outdated operating systems, and that newer features (like Cortana) might only reach a fraction of its users. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft addressed these headwinds by making Windows 10 a free year-long upgrade for most users, and tethered PCs, mobile devices, and Xbox Ones to a universal app store. The Windows Store remains much smaller than Google Play and the App Store, but it's an encouraging step toward generating revenue from apps instead of paid OS licenses. To counter similar problems with Office licenses, Microsoft pivoted toward Office 365, which runs on a cloud-based subscription model. Earlier this year, Gartner reported that Office 365 was more popular than Google Apps among large enterprise customers. Weakness in mobile and cloud ecosystems If Microsoft had a viable mobile OS, the slowdown in PC sales wouldn't be as challenging. Unfortunately, Windows Phone controlled just 0.4% of the global smartphone market in the second quarter, according to IDC. Android and iOS respectively controlled 87.6% and 11.7% of the market. The lack of a mobile platform makes it hard for Microsoft to expand cloud-based features like Bing Search and Cortana. Without users feeding data to those services, the overall usefulness of its cloud platform Azure as an analytics tool declined. In response, Microsoft reduced the number of smartphones it would launch every year, and pivoted toward launching major apps like Office 365, OneDrive, Bing, and Cortana on iOS and Android. It even forged partnerships with numerous Android OEMs to pre-install those apps on their devices. Microsoft is also trying to blur the lines between mobile devices and PCs with new Surface 2-in-1 devices and Continuum, a Windows 10 feature which converts Windows 10 Mobile devices into full desktop PCs. By doing so, Microsoft is leveraging its strength in PCs (particularly among larger enterprise customers) to promote the idea of an "all in one" device to replace the smartphone, tablet, and PC. Continuum. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft is also gathering more data from its users than before with Windows 10. That practice was criticized by privacy advocates, but it's arguably necessary to get the OS, Cortana, Bing, Azure, and other Microsoft platforms onto the same cloud-based page. To do so, it recently merged the Microsoft Research and Information Platform Groups with the Bing, Cortana, robotics, and ambient computing teams to create the new AI and Research Group. That team will infuse Microsoft's apps with AI features (like Skype translate), develop new features with facial recognition and machine analytics, and expand the company's cloud infrastructure to "build the world's most powerful supercomputer with Azure." In other words, Microsoft wants to expand its cloud ecosystem to counter Google's, while helping Azure close the gap with Amazon's market-leading AWS (Amazon Web Services). But will these strategies pay off? Microsoft still has a long way to go before it can catch up to Google, Apple, and Amazon in the mobile and cloud platform markets. Nonetheless, Nadella's forward-thinking strategies are arguably superior to the complacent tactics that came before, and could gradually offset Microsoft's outdated dependence on PC sales and licensing fees.

Yes, the search giant will go forward with the Pixel line but it's not the same. Here's the thing - a Nexus is an Android phone, a Pixel is a Google phone. Android is the dominating OS, developed by Google itself, phone manufacturers and even part-time volunteers. And yes, it's closely associated and often tied to Google services. But it doesn't have to be - you can use WhatsApp or Telegram instead of Allo, Bing or DuckDuckGo instead of Search, F-Droid or Amazon's Store instead of Play Store, HERE or OsmAnd instead of Google Maps and so on. There are many alternatives - both commercial and open source - that both users and phone manufacturers could choose between. For example, before Google Maps used offline storage, Samsung put HERE Maps on its phones and let you download maps to the whole world for free. Android could be anything you want it to be, the Pixels can only be Google phones. Google wants you to use its services, same as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. This works great for Apple, okay for Amazon and not at all for Microsoft. Could Google succeed in being a premium company? Because the hacker-friendly attitude wasn't even the best part of the Nexus line - the Nexus 4 was a flagship for very little money (it was $200 at one point!). The Nexus 5, which had features even the Pixels lack, launched at $350 and got several price cuts later. True, the Nexus 6 went premium at $650, but it was a 6" phone with stereo speakers, OIS, wireless charging and some water resistance at the same price as the small Pixel. Will you miss the affordable flagship Nexus? Or the high-end Nexus with reliable software upgrades and great potential for customization? Or is a Google phone what you really wanted? The Nexus line is dead, will you miss it?

James Martin/CNET Google Pixel offers cold comfort to silent partner 0 Share: Mobile by Roger Cheng October 5, 2016 9:15 AM PDT @RogerWCheng Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech The Google Pixel phone was quietly built by HTC.Photo by James Martin/CNET HTC needed a break. It got just that when Google chose the veteran phone manufacturer to produce its newest flagship phones, the Pixel and Pixel XL. The partnership is a testament to strong relationship between Google and HTC, which was also tapped to build the original Android phone, the G1, as well as the first Nexus phone, the Nexus One. That courtesy, however, did not extend to the actual Pixel unveiling. Google never uttered its longtime partner's name during the roughly 90-minute presentation Tuesday. That's the kind of semi-win, semi-loss situation that has come to define HTC. The company has a buzz-worthy product in its Vive virtual-reality headset, but its core phone business has struggled. It builds beautifully designed products, but they're often ignored. As a result, the HTC name sits on the periphery of consumer awareness. You might have recognized it once and even coveted one of its phones at one point, but it's a faded memory. So will the Pixel partnership get folks looking at HTC again? Probably not. HTC was just happy to have a part in one of the highest-profile phones of the year. "We're proud that when Google needed an industry-leading partner for the Pixel, HTC was the clear answer," said HTC spokesman Jeff Gordon. Google, meanwhile, emphasized the role it played in developing the Pixel. "There is no HTC branding because this is a Google phone that brings together premium hardware by multiple partners to serve a best in class software experience for users," said a company spokesman. More from Google's event Google Pixel phones, Daydream View and Chromecast Ultra: Everything Google just announced Google's Pixel, Pixel XL are superphones set to take on iPhone 7 Pixel hardware event is really about software See all of our Google coverage The deal to be a silent partner hearkens back to HTC's early days as a contract manufacturer, when it built phones for companies like Hewlett-Packard and Palm, which would slap on their own logos. "HTC started out as an original device manufacturer, so this is partly the company returning to its roots," said Avi Greengart, who covers consumer products for Consumer Analysis. Not content to let others take the credit, HTC launched its own brand in 2009 with a global marketing campaign. By 2012, it was the fourth-largest smartphone maker in the world, according to IDC. Today, it's been shunted into the "other" category, too small to warrant individual mention. As such, industry observers see the deal as a slight positive only because Google is throwing some manufacturing business at HTC. It's just the latest product the company has built with better-known partners. It developed the Vive headset in cooperation with video game software maker Valve, and it has built a family of connected health-tracking devices for clothing maker Under Armour. Few lasting benefits It's unlikely you're going to wake up today and realize you want an HTC phone. At least with Google's previous strategy of building Nexus phones, partners like HTC or LG could share in the buzz that comes from a phone with the latest version of Android. Google would talk up its partners during the product unveiling. By moving to the Pixel brand, the search titan is sending a message to consumers and partners alike that this is the first true Google phone. HTC will get minimal recognition, if any. The HTC 10 did not resonate with consumers. Photo by CNET "It's way too inside baseball -- most consumers have never heard of HTC, and even fewer will know that Pixel is made by HTC," Greengart said. HTC's own flagship One series has floundered, including this year's HTC 10. Meanwhile, the company's revenue dropped amid continued losses in the second quarter. While the extra business will help HTC's bottom line, it isn't sustainable, according to IDC analyst Ramon Llamas. Google has traditionally hopped from one partner to another and could do the same with the next Pixel phone. Llamas took it a step further, questioning whether the Nexus program offered enough tangible benefits to any of its partners. While Nexus phones drew a lot of buzz from the hardcore Android crowd, mainstream consumers have gravitated towards Android phones from the likes of Samsung and LG. The situation is likely even worse now with the Pixel. "I don't see anyone getting much of a halo effect from being the manufacturer of Google's devices," he said. That's little comfort to one of Google's oldest partners.

You can also get Amazon's assistant Alexa in a smaller package that you can plug into your own sound system -- called the Amazon Echo Dot for $50. Before we tested the Home, I expected it to win as an entertainer and a personal assistant, and I expected Alexa to win as a smart home controller. Let's see if that holds true.

Echo has an ever-growing list of 900+ skills and counting Entertainment The Amazon Echo and the Google Home are both always listening due to their built-in microphones that can hear voice input from a moderate distance. The Echo wakes up to the command "Alexa" or you can change the wake word to "Echo." The Home listens for either "Okay Google" or "Hey Google." Both do a fine job of hearing you even across a large room and over moderate background noise. If you turn the volume all the way up on your music, both will understandably have trouble picking your voice out of the racket. Giving Google Home an ear exam Can Google Home hear you over background music? I pit it against Amazon Echo and turn up the volume to find out. by Andrew Gebhart 1:29 Close Drag As speakers, both function well enough for listening to music. Though neither lived up to the standards of CNET's audiophiles. Check out Ty Pendlebury's detailed breakdown of how the Home does vs the Echo as far as sound quality. In short, he recommends that if you're looking strictly for a Bluetooth speaker -- keeping looking. On the plus side, both offer ways of connecting to your existing sound system. The mini version of the Echo -- the Amazon Echo Dot -- plugs into your speakers. With the Home, you can control any Google Cast enabled speaker or any speaker connected to a Chromecast Audio streamer. Bonus points for the Home: you can also control your TV if you have a Chromecast video streamer. Currently, you can only use the Home's controls on Youtube, and you have to pull up specific videos by name or a group of videos like "trending" or "popular." Supposedly, the Home will work with Netflix and Google Images soon, so then it'll be more useful. Right now, it's a cool idea that's not that helpful in reality. Home's built-in speaker plays music well enough for me, but the sound quality didn't satisfy our audiophiles.Photo by Tyler Lizenby/CNET Alexa does have some TV integration as well if you have a Fire TV, but you need to press a button on a specific Fire TV remote, so the always listening the Echo can't help you with your TV yet through first party support. That said, it can go above and beyond what Home can do right now if you have a Logitech Harmony setup, including turning your TV on and off and changing the channel. The Home's integration with Chromecast can't do any of that, but a Chromecast streamer is $35, and a Logitech setup costs hundreds of dollars. Plus, with the Home, you can group multiple speakers and play one song simultaneously in multiple rooms of your house. Both the Home and Alexa play games, tell jokes, and respond wittily to movie lines like "I am your father." Alexa's been around for longer, so the Amazon assistant has many more fun extras than Google Home. Alexa can lead you on a choose-your-own-adventure-style Batman game. Alexa's Jeopardy game is also much better than Home's simplistic and over-the-top trivia. Still, I'm giving this category to the Home because extras aside, the Home's ability to group your speakers and cheaply control your TV makes it wonderfully useful as a whole home entertainer, even if that TV integration isn't all that useful at the moment. Verdict: Google Home wins entertainment Personal Assistant Google Home learns more about you through a variety of Google services -- Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Maps, so I expected it to easily beat Alexa in this category. Not only can the Home tell you about the appointments on your calendar, it can tell you about traffic on your way to work in the morning. Plus, the Home uses Google Assistant to respond to voice commands conversationally. Debuted on the company's new Pixel phones, Google made a big show of the assistant's ability to learn from your questions when the company first showed off Google Home back in May. 18 Here's everything the Google Home can do In other words, you can ask Google Home "Who plays Luke Skywalker?" Thanks to the Google Assistant, the Home will give you an answer. Then, you can follow that question with "What other movies is he in?" The Home will infer the "he" you're referring to is the actor Mark Hamill and still provide an answer. The Home doesn't let you change anything on your calendar yet. It also doesn't integrate with Gmail or Google docs. It won't tell you directions or send directions to your phone. And you can make a shopping list that'll show up in Google Keep, but you can't make any other type of list yet or even set reminders. The Home's integration with Google services didn't actually prove all that helpful in my testing, at least not yet. As for the conversational awareness, it's a neat trick, but the Home only understands limited context for now, and surprisingly, Alexa kept up with the Home on this front. We asked Alexa to tell us the weather. Then, we asked, "How about Friday?" and Alexa understood and responded without needing to hear the word "weather" again. Conversations with Google Home A quick look at Home's conversational capabilities vs the Echo and Alexa. by Andrew Gebhart 1:06 Close Drag The Home understands a little more context, but not much more. Alexa also lets you set reminders and make to do lists. And the clincher -- Alexa has immense third party support and more than 3,000 skills, which are essentially apps for your Echo. Thanks to those skills, and the fact that Alexa keeps up pretty well with Google Home in contextual awareness, it wins the upset victory in this category. Though, once the Home gets a few updates and a few more integrations with other Google services, this category could easily shift to the Home in the future. Verdict: Amazon Echo wins as a personal assistant Smart home controller Speaking of those 3,000 skills, with Alexa's two year head start in building a catalog of compatible smart home devices, and given that Google Home launched with just four -- SmartThings, Nest, Philips Hue, and IFTTT -- I didn't think the Home would be able to keep up with the Amazon Echo in this important category. 15 Everything that will work with Google Home An always-listening device makes it much easier for a family to control the smart home. We found that out first hand in the CNET Smart Home, and it's a big part of why Alexa is a central part of our living lab for testing connected gadgets. We did that before the Home existed, though, and the Home puts up an admirable fight for smart home supremacy. For one, Home responds more flexibly to commands than Alexa. Both the Home and Alexa pull device names from their respective first party apps -- so the Philips Hue app for Philips bulbs. With Alexa, you can create named groups for your devices. With the Home, you can give them nicknames and group them into rooms. For a bulb called "desk lamp" in the Philips app, Alexa will only respond if you tell it to turn on the "desk lamp." You can create a group for all lights or office lights, then command Alexa to turn off the office lights and it'll work. Without those groups though, Alexa won't respond to any other names for the lamp, including "desk light." With Google Home, I nicknamed the desk lamp "Lampy," and assigned it to the office. I could then control it by commanding Google to turn on the "desk lamp," "lampy," "desk light," "office light," or "lights." Google doesn't get any extra credit for the "office light" command since assigning the lamp to the room is similar to adding it to a group for Alexa, but I appreciated the Home automatically grouping it with the rest of my lights and helping me out with the difference between "light" and "lamp." Google Home fit into our smart home nicely. The changeable bases helped us find the perfect look.Photo by Tyler Lizenby/CNET Google's integrations with IFTTT and Philips Hue are also better than Alexa's. With the Home, you can control the colors of your Philips bulbs. You can't do that with Alexa right now. With IFTTT -- the online rule maker that stands for "If This Then That" -- the Home lets you craft fully customizable commands including multiple options for how you might want to say the command. You have to use the word "trigger" to activate a customizable command with Alexa. For example, with the Home, I was able to create a rule that allowed me to say "I'm leaving," "I'm out," or "Switch Ecobee to away mode." Home would respond to each of these and switch modes for my Ecobee3 thermostat. You can create the same rule with Alexa, but you'd have to say something like "Alexa, trigger Ecobee to away mode." The Home's flexible phrasing could eventually make it better for the smart home than Alexa, as the other members of your family don't have to memorize as many exact commands to control your devices. For now, Alexa's sheer number of skills keeps it on top of this contest, but Google Home makes the battle much closer than I thought it would be. Verdict: Amazon Echo wins as a smart home controller Final count For now, the Amazon Echo beats the Google Home 2-1 and wins the battle in this exciting new category of devices. Undoubtedly, although this first battle is won, the competition is far from over. The Home will integrate with more smart home platforms, more Google services, and get better and better at understanding context as a conversational assistant. Just don't expect Alexa to sit idly by as Google Home improves. For consumers, the competition can only be a good thing. Hopefully, the Home pushes Alexa to be more conversational and Alexa pushes the Home to aggressively pursue third party support. With Apple reportedly also developing a similar device, one thing's for sure: the game is on.

It supports more than 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. Noto is a massive undertaking, but one deemed necessary by Google. It's been working on the project over the past five years in collaboration with Monotype in hopes of eradicating so-called "tofu"—the blank boxes you see when a PC or website can't display a particular text—from the web. Noto, or No more tofu, is Google's answer and it's available now to download. "The Noto project started as a necessity for Google’s Android and ChromeOS operating systems. When we began, we did not realize the enormity of the challenge. It required design and technical testing in hundreds of languages, and expertise from specialists in specific scripts," Google explains in a blog post. "In Arabic, for example, each character has four glyphs (i.e., shapes a character can take) that change depending on the text that comes after it. In Indic languages, glyphs may be reordered or even split into two depending on the surrounding text." Solving the challenge meant partnering with various experts in type and font design. Monotype played the biggest role, though Google also collaborated with Adobe and had a network of volunteer reviewers. As far as Monotype is concerned, Noto is one of the expansive typography projects ever undertaken. "We are passionately dedicated to type and helping to advance the use and adoption of type across many cultures, languages and geographies. We are thrilled to have played such an important role in what has become one of the most significant type projects of all time," said Scott Landers, president and CEO of Monotype. "The combination of Monotype’s type expertise and Google’s innovation has proven to be a productive relationship and we look forward to continued collaboration that helps advance the use of type to new places." Noto fonts are available in eight weights. A whopping 110,000 characters comprise the entire set, and in an effort to keep consistent with Unicode, Google will update Noto as new characters are introduced to it. That includes the recent emoji additions. You can download all the Noto fonts here.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise Google Removes AdSense Ad Limit Policy: Reasons Behind the Change Digital Advertising  News August 24, 2016 Digital Advertising News Matt SouthernAugust 24, 2016 SEJ STAFF 829SHARES 4.8KREADS 829SHARES 4.8KREADS SEJ STAFFMatt Southern 829SHARES 4.8KREADS Google recently refreshed its AdSense ad limit policy, removing the restriction it once had on the amount of ads publishers can place on one page. Old Policy vs. New Policy Using the WayBack Machine, you can see that the policy once read as follows: “Currently, on each page AdSense publishers may place: – Up to three AdSense for content units – Up to three link units – Up to two search boxes Publishers may not place more than one “large” ad unit per page. We define a “large” ad unit as any unit similar in size to our 300×600 format. For example, this would include our 300×1050 and 970×250 formats, our 750×200 and 580×400 regional formats, and any other custom sized ad with comparable dimensions.” Now, you can see in Google’s current ad placement policies that the ‘ad limit per page’ section has been removed. It has been replaced with a section titled ‘valuable inventory’, which cautions site owners not to let the amount of ads on a page exceed the amount of actual content. Doing so may result in Google limiting or disabling ads served on the page until appropriate changes are made. I spoke with a Google representative this afternoon who confirmed the ad limit has been removed. Reasons Behind the Removal of Google’s AdSense Ad Limit Google’s previous ad limit policy was in effect for many years — in fact, the company has not updated it since the rise of mobile. Improving Web Content The primary reason behind this change is to create a better balance between quality content and advertising. Rather than looking at this change as a cap that has been removed, it should be looked at as a way to improve the overall quality of content on the web. One of the ways many publishers have been getting around the ad limit is to break content down into multiple pages using slideshows. Removing the limit on the amount of ads that can be placed on one page will hopefully lead to less slideshow-based content, and more high quality content. Encouraging Publishers to Test New Ad Units To coincide with the rise of mobile, Google introduced new mobile-friendly ad units. However,  publishers are hesitant to test the new ad units because they don’t want to give up any ad units that are currently in place. If publishers remove one of the ad units they’re currently using it could potentially lead to a loss in revenue. Realizing this, Google made the decision to rethink the ad limit policy in hopes that more publishers will begin using the new mobile-friendly ads. Keeping Advertisers Happy Companies that are paying to advertise via mobile-friendly ad units are not receiving a maximum return on investment if publishers are not utilizing the ads. Publishers are a critical component of advertising; if publishers don’t display the ads then companies will be less likely to pay for advertising. Google sees this change as more of a partnership with its publishers, allowing them to further monetize their content while keeping advertisers happy at the same time. Will Publishers Go Overboard With Ads? Now that there is no defined limit on the amount of ads that can be placed on a single page, is there a concern that publishers may start to abuse their advertising privileges? It’s still in a publisher’s best interest not to go overboard with ads, because it would degrade the user experience. If visitors are inundated with too many ads it could lead to them abandoning the web page, which would in turn affect a publisher’s ability to monetize. Although there is no longer an exact limit on the amount of ads that can be used on a page, there still has to be a suitable balance between ads and original content. Using an excessive amount of ads can still lead to a violation of Google’s ad implementation policies, which will result in Google either limiting or disabling a publisher’s ads.

 Here's what Wall Street is saying after Google's big hardware event Avery Hartmans Oct. 5, 2016, 10:52 AM 7,538 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai Reuters/Stephen Lam Wall Street was impressed by Tuesday's big Google event, which unveiled new hardware such as the Pixel phone and the Google Home device, and launched the company's new artificial intelligence Assistant on several new devices. The company's stock has remained stable since then — it's up slightly, about 0.46% as of 10 a.m. Wednesday — but analysts say the new products are a good sign for Google, even though it appears to be following in the footsteps of other, more accomplished hardware companies such as Apple and Amazon. Here's what Wall Street analysts had to say: Macquarie Macquarie remains bullish on Google, affirming its "outperform" rating and setting a price target of $975. It describes Google's new products as "me too" — meaning it's showing up to the game a bit late, after Apple has mastered the smartphone and Amazon has dominated the AI device market with Alexa and the Echo. While Macquarie thinks Google's voice recognition capabilities could be what sets the Assistant and Google Home apart from the competition, it's taking a conservative view on the new products: "GOOG's past attempts at hardware (Nexus, Chromebooks, Glass, Nest, etc...) have not amounted to much and given their track record, we are not going to give them the benefit of the doubt on any hardware efforts until we see otherwise. The bottom line is the VR and AI capabilities shown are interesting but we don't see much hardware here that's particularly innovative versus what's currently in the market. We think this is particularly disappointing given GOOG's focus on R&D, virtually unlimited resources and unique capabilities." All the new products unveiled at Google's October 4 event. Skye Gould/Business Insider Jefferies According to Jefferies, Google just introduced "some of its most interesting hardware devices yet." Jefferies' price target is on the higher end — $1,000 — and it's maintaining a "buy" rating. Perhaps most interestingly, Jefferies is taking a very bullish stance on Google Home. Analysts estimated the market for virtual assistants could reach $2.1 billion by 2017, and Jefferies says Google Home has the potential to add $500 million in revenue for Google by then. Baird Equity Research Baird set one of the more conservative price targets, at $900, and rates Google's stock at "outperform." But Baird is betting most on machine learning and AI as the key to Google's success down the line. Here's what Baird's analysts wrote: "As AI/Machine Learning emerge as the next 'computing wave,' Google's virtual assistant sits at the core of both Pixel and Home, and showcase the focus at the intersection of hardware and software. We continue to believe that Google's ML/AI capabilities are a key competitive differentiator, often overlooked by investors."

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsAmazon’s Plans to Beat Google in Its own Turf (AMZN, GOOG) Amazon’s Plans to Beat Google in Its own Turf (AMZN, GOOG) Not satisfied being the dominating force in the e-commerce industry, Amazon is now challenging Google in its own turf. October 9, 2016 WSP Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) exponential growth has been giving rivals sleepless nights but the e-commerce titan is not done dominating one industry after another. Next on the company’s hit list? Google. In a feature by The Wall Street Journal, Amazon has been slowly making a presence in the digital advertising business and though the move is in its infancy, the online retailer is using its 63 million strong Prime members as leverage to win over advertisers. According to news source, Amazon’s ad business is pretty basic, focusing more on driving online sales using sponsored ads anywhere online or through Amazon’s online store but it won’t be long before the e-commerce powerhouse will use its culled data to attract more marketers. For one thing, Amazon can make any partner brands look good to customers, scoring targeted sales. The Seattle-based company could also provide more exposure to its marketers’ products to boost sales. Market research firm eMarketer has predicted that in 2017, Amazon’s ad business will grow to an impressive 9.4%, generating about 1 billion in online revenue in the US alone. But with Amazon’s North American division’s 28% growth in the second quarter and a harder push for sponsored listings on its website and app, there’s the real possibility that Amazon’s ad campaign will exceed the market’s expectation. Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of the digital ad agency “Deep Focus” said Amazon culled so much data that it’s anyone’s guess how it will be used and for how long since the company implements strict rules on how its data is used outside of its shopping platform. Now the question is, will Amazon’s entry in the ad segment pose a threat to Google’s lead position? That will depend really on how hard Amazon wants to push in its ad rivalry against Google. That said, the e-commerce firm has yet to lay out a plan in terms of expanding its own digital marketing campaign. Additionally, there’s no way to say if Amazon will be in it for long-term since the company has a lot on its plate. Google-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains unfazed over Amazon’s entry into an industry the search giant  has dominated for years. The Alphabet Inc.-owned conglomerate is betting big on its own shopping platform, an e-commerce channel that will feature sponsored products with images linked within Google’s own search results and shopping site. These ads are the same ones that eBay, Wal-Mart, Target and other online retailers use, with the exemption of Amazon. This means there’s plenty of opportunity for Google to cement its leading position in the industry. Curiously, Amazon is keeping its new business under wraps and it’s hard to guess the company’s level of commitment to the initiative. Although the online retailer remains a minor player in the ad marketing segment, Amazon may give Google – along with the industry’s number 2. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) – a real competition as long as it plays its cards right. AMZN GOOGL Previous article Next article Related Articles Business How Does Amazon (AMZN) Get Such a High Valuation?

(Eric Risberg/Associated Press) By Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman, Bloomberg Published: October 9, 2016, 6:00 AM A   A Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a year-long odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc. unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company’s retail efforts. What’s more, it’s inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc., the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies’ in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google’s digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. “We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome,” UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the U.S., via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It’s working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google’s online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn’t enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. “Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships,” he said. Many of Google’s past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google’s target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, Calif. headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google’s sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn’t want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product’s complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling program through physical and online stores. Google’s new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. A ‘Journey’ Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a “journey,” gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone’s full life cycle after a few generations. On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. “We’re in it for the long run,” he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavor of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can re-absorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company’s sales aspirations. “In markets where we do business, we’re definitely going to want meaningful share,” he said. “But it’s highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume.” Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple’s devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. “The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system,” he said.

Tech heavyweights race for artificial intelligence edge Technology Sunday 9 October 2016 - 12:29pm File: Major technology firms are racing to infuse smartphones and other internet-linked devices with software smarts that help them think like people. Photo: Flickr.com/Jhaymesisviphotography SAN FRANCISCO - Major technology firms are racing to infuse smartphones and other internet-linked devices with software smarts that help them think like people. The effort is seen as an evolution in computing that allows users to interact with machines in natural conversation style, telling devices to tend to tasks such as ordering goods, checking traffic, making restaurant reservations or searching for information. The artificial intelligence (AI) component in these programs aims to create a world in which everyone can have a virtual aide that gets to know them better with each interaction. Here are some of the offerings available: Google Google is making a high-profile push into AI, with the internet titan's chief referring to it as a force for change as powerful as smartphones. Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets - aiming to outdo Apple's Siri - enabling users to organise and use information on the devices and in the cloud - to check emails, stay up to date on calendar appointments, news or ask for traffic and weather data. Google also offers AI through its Allo messaging application which can be installed on smartphones, and its Google Home hub, a standalone device similar to Amazon's Echo which responds to voice commands to manage tasks and fetch information where people live. Samsung The South Korean electronics giant moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri. Samsung says the acquisition announced this month is part of its effort to provide AI-based voice assistance services its customers can use across all Samsung devices and products, from smartphones to televisions to washing machines. Samsung is world's leading maker of smartphones powered by Google's free Android software, but also has its own Tizen mobile operating system, so how it may field its own virtual assistant technology remains to be seen. READ: iPhone 7 coming 14 October Amazon Amazon in 2014 unveiled its Echo home assistant, a voice-activated speaker, powered by its "Alexa" artificial intelligence program. Users can ask for news or information updates, as well as ordering goods from the online retail giant. Echo also serves as a connected-home hub which can control compatible appliances, lightbulbs and other devices. Since introducing Echo, Amazon has launched a smaller version called "Dot" and integrated Alexa into its Fire TV devices. Microsoft Microsoft's personal assistant uses the name Cortana and is available on Windows devices and its Xbox console and as an application on Apple iOS and Android devices. Unveiled in 2014, Cortana - a name based on a character in its blockbuster game "Halo" - responds to conversationally spoken requests or commands, using insights gleaned from calendars, contact lists, online searches and other smartphone sources to respond in a manner akin to a real-life aide. Facebook Facebook, heavily investing in artificial intelligence, is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename "M." The social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to create a real-life version of "Jarvis," the assistant in the assistant in the Marvel Comics series "Iron Man." For now, Facebook is enabling AI-powered "bots" on its Messenger mobile application that allows users to get answers to questions and engage in text exchanges as though chatting with the social network itself. Apple Apple was the first to offer its personal assistant, introducing Siri for the iPhone in 2011, and has been working to improve it over the years. Recently, Siri was upgraded to interact with non-Apple applications, so users can book a ride with Lyft or make payments using Square Cash. Apple has also introduced a Home application that can connect with smart appliances and other devices, and is reportedly working on a standalone speaker similar to Amazon Echo and Google Home. IBM Technology stalwart IBM made headlines nearly 20 years ago with "Deep Blue" software that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov at his own game, and more recently with "Watson" artificial intelligence that triumphed over top human players in a Jeopardy television game show. IBM has put Watson to work making business systems and services smarter with data and customers.

The Mountain View company's upcoming physical location is expected to feature a bunch of new hardware that it has in the pipeline, including the Google Pixel line of mobile devices. The pop-up will open its doors on Oct. 20, Thursday, which is the same day the Google Pixel and Pixel XL will be available on retailers' shelves. Moreover, with the Made by Google branding, the pop-up will go beyond just the mobile device. Bear in mind that aside from the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google also introduced a handful of other products during an event held Tuesday, Oct. 4. The list includes the Daydream View virtual reality headset, the Google Home smart speaker that has a lot of similarities with Amazon Echo, the Chromecast Ultra, which supports 4K HDR streaming, and the Google Wifi, which can form a mesh of networks using multiple routers. But it's not just the latest products. Their predecessors will also be featured in the pop-up. For instance, the Chromecast and Chromecast Audio. It is unknown whether other Google devices will find their way to the pop-up's shelves, as Google is yet to hint at other devices aside from the mentioned ones. However, the Made by Google pop-up should not be expected to be a purchase point for the mentioned devices or any device from Google for that matter. Rather, the pop-up will open its doors to give consumers the "experience" and have them try out the company's product offerings. Aside from the Spring Street location, Google has not specified any other venues. But granted that this one becomes successful, it may lead the Mountain View company to open Google experience centers in other key locations within the country. Having such physical locations to host product demos and provide users the chance to try out its latest wares can play out well for Google and its future product releases. More than any of Google's other recently introduced products, consumers are likely to line up for the Google Pixel smartphone and Pixel XL phablet. Aside from the awesome ad, both devices will come out of the box with Android 7.1 Nougat on board. They'll also sport the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC, which Qualcomm claims will deliver 10 percent more performance over the Snapdragon 820. This should be plenty when coupled with 4 GB of RAM on the two devices. And yes, they both come with fast charging and 3.5mm headphone jack.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN FRANCISCO • There’s a quirky twist on tourism emerging amid the Silicon Valley whirlwind of innovation that has tethered everyone to their smartphones. Those omnipresent devices are being used to track down technological touchstones scattered around the San Francisco Bay area so selfies can be taken, videos can be recorded and the experience can be celebrated in a Facebook post, Snapchat or tweet. Here’s a tourist’s guide to nerd nirvana for those more interested in seeing the suburban home where The Woz built the first Apple computer alongside Steve Jobs than the spooky prison in the Bay where the Birdman of Alcatraz once served time alongside Machine Gun Kelly. Growing up in a garage Silicon Valley startups have a history of humble beginnings, dating to 1939 when Hewlett-Packard Co. was founded in a Palo Alto, Calif., garage. It still stands at 367 Addison Avenue, considered by many to be the birthplace of Silicon Valley. HP now owns the place. Jobs was one of many entrepreneurs influenced by the HP legacy as a teenager, eventually inspiring him and his engineering friend, Steve “The Woz” Wozniak, to begin working on Apple’s first computer in the home of Jobs’ parents. That ranch-style house at 2066 Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, is now owned by Jobs’ sister, Patricia. After they started Google in 1998, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin built what would become the world’s dominant search engine in a garage and room they rented from Susan Wojcicki, whom they later hired (she now runs YouTube for them). The Menlo Park, Calif., house, at 232 Santa Margarita Avenue, is now owned by Google. Shortly after starting Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004, Mark Zuckerberg and a few friends moved to Silicon Valley for what they thought would be just one summer. Zuckerberg never returned to Harvard, and the world hasn’t been quite the same since then. The Palo Alto, Calif., house where Zuckerberg did a lot of computer coding and threw some wild parties, if you believe the movies, is located at 819 La Jennifer Way. The place is still rented out by young entrepreneurs hoping some of Zuckerberg’s magic will rub off on them. Today’s technology temples The headquarters of Apple, Google and Facebook have turned into must-see shrines to products that have become part of culture’s lifeblood. None of the companies offers public tours, but that doesn’t mean you can’t steal glimpses at these factories of innovation. Search starts here Google is the most accessible of the three headquarters. The hub of its Mountain View, Calif., campus is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, with other Google offices sprawling almost all the way down to the nearby NASA Ames Research Center, where Page and Brin keep personal jets in a hangar. Walk down Charleston Road and you are bound to see one of the company’s employees (also known as “Googlers”) cruising on yellow, green, blue and red bikes placed outside all the offices to get to meetings more quickly. While strolling around, make sure to swing into the office at 1981 Landings Drive, where you can take a selfie with Android statues memorializing different versions of the operating system that powers most of the world’s smartphones. Each statue represents a dessert because Google has nicknamed each version after something sweet. The menu includes “Cupcake,” “Donut,” “Eclair,” “Froyo,” “Gingerbread,” Honeycomb,” “Ice Cream Sandwich,” “Jelly Bean,” “KitKat,” “Lollipop” and “Marshmallow.” The latest serving of Android, called “Nougat,” has just started rolling out. Finally, in the Google store on the main campus, you can buy company-branded merchandise, including shirts, hats, mugs, pens and even notebooks (the kind with paper). A place everyone likes The giant thumbs-up sign replicating Facebook’s symbol for liking a post has become one of the most photographed spots in Silicon Valley since the social networking company moved its headquarters from Palo Alto to 1 Hacker Way in nearby Menlo Park five years ago. Unless you happen to be in a plane or have a camera-equipped drone, you won’t be able to see what’s on top of another Facebook building across the street (an underground tunnel connects the offices). That building, designed by famed architect Frank Gehry, features a 9-acre park atop the roof. One more thing Apple, founded in 1976, has had a fiercely loyal following for decades, so its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters has long drawn tourists looking to get a picture of its famous logo and the 1 Infinite Loop sign denoting its address. There is, of course, an Apple store at the headquarters, where people can buy company-branded merchandise not sold in most of its other stores. But you can’t get help fixing your iPhone, iPad or Mac here. You’ll have to go to another store for an appointment at the Genius Bar that serves as Apple’s customer-help desk. The current headquarters will be overshadowed next year when Apple plans to open a nearby 2.8 million-square-foot, circular office that has been likened to a huge spaceship sitting on a 176-acre site. Known as “Campus 2,” the new building is designed to accommodate about 12,000 workers. Before Jobs died in 2011, he stipulated that the campus should be surrounded by about 7,000 trees. What about the house on TV? The HBO comedy “Silicon Valley” has won many accolades over three seasons, so fans may want to see the house that serves as headquarters for the fictional startup, Pied Piper. The location has been given as 5230 Newell Road in Palo Alto on the series, but that address doesn’t exist. The house is actually is in southern California, at 5230 Penfield Avenue in Woodland Hills. So put it on the sightseeing list for your next visit to Hollywood.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Android 7.1 Nougat Changelog – Here’s What You Can Expect from It By Uzair Ghani Posted 1 month ago 17Shares Share Tweet Submit Here’s the full Android 7.1 Nougat changelog outlining Pixel, Pixel XL-exclusive features and what non-Pixel users can expect from it. The Complete Android 7.1 Nougat Changelog Is Here, but Don’t Expect Too Much If You’re a Non-Pixel User The Google Pixel and Pixel XL handsets will run Nougat out of the box. But it’s not off the shelf version of the software that’s available publicly, it’s version 7.1 in fact, as revealed during Google’s October 4 keynote. It’s tailor-made with new devices in mind and come packed with a load of exclusive features as well. Luckily though, the entire Android 7.1 Nougat update itself isn’t going to be exclusive to just the latest Pixel handsets. It will eventually roll out to other devices too, including the Nexus lineup. But, certain features of the software will stay exclusive to Pixel handsets, and there’s no telling whether or not these additions will make it onto other devices. So, if you do get the update, what can you expect from it? We have stumbled upon the complete Android 7.1 changelog, courtesy of AndroidPolice, that highlights Pixel-exclusvie features as well as those that will aimed towards users with non-Pixel phones. Pixel product-specific Pixel Launcher – swipe up for all apps, new Search Box, date/weather header on home Google Assistant Unlimited original quality photo/video backup to Google Photos Smart Storage – when storage is full, automatically removes old backed up photos/videos Phone/Chat support (new support tab in settings), screen-share functionality Quick switch adapter for wired setup from Android or iPhone Pixel Camera: Electronic Image Stabilization (“video stabilization”) 2.0 Pro Features White Balance Presets Exposure Compensation AE/AF Locking Viewfinder grid modes HW-accelerated (on Qualcomm Hexagon coprocessor) HDR+ image processing Smartburst Sensor Hub processor with tightly integrated sensors (accel, gyro, mag) + connectivity (Wi-Fi, Cell, GPS) Cosmetic Solid navbar icons with home affordance for Assistant SysUI accent color theming Wallpaper picker with new wallpapers and sounds New setup look and feel Dynamic calendar date icon Android Nougat 7.1 Advertisement Night Light Touch/display performance improvements Moves (Fingerprint swipe down gesture – opt-in) Seamless A/B system updates Daydream VR mode Developer features: App shortcuts / shortcut manager APIs Circular app icons support Keyboard image insertion Fingerprint sensor gesture to open/close notification shade Manual storage manager Intent for apps Improved VR thread scheduling Enhanced wallpaper metadata Multi-endpoint call support Support for various MNO requirements PCDMA voice privacy property Source type support for Visual Voicemail Carrier config options for managing video telephony Manual storage manager – identifies apps and files and apps using storage As you can see from the changelog, non-Pixel devices can expect the new Night Light feature to grace their devices that works more or less like iOS’ Night Shift mode. Furthermore, users can except touch-screen and display related improvements as well with things topped off Daydream VR mode. Rest of the feature additions are focused mainly towards developers and they look exciting nonetheless. Wrap Up It’s highly likely Android 7.1 Nougat will start rolling out for devices by the end of this year. It also makes sense to keep the software exclusive for Pixel and Pixel XL devices in the weeks to come. After all, there has to be differentiation between Nexus devices and Pixel, right? Once Android 7.1 is available for download, we will inform our readers about it, so stay tuned to our coverage.

On Friday, reports surfaced Disney and Google had bowed out of the discussions. Now, according to a Bloomberg weekend report, the remaining pursuers are also gone: Twitter once saw interest from Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Salesforce.com Inc. and Walt Disney Co., all of which consulted with banks on whether to acquire the social-media company. Now all of those suitors are unlikely to make a bid, according to people familiar with the matter. On Friday, Twitter had planned to have a board meeting with outside advisers on a sale but canceled, one of the people said. There’s always a chance that another potential bidder will step up into the mix, but so many interested parties dropping out of the race in so short a time isn’t a good sign. If it’s unable to find a suitor, the company’s fate will instead likely rest in its ability to attract new users by offering live video and other features: If a buyer doesn’t appear, Twitter will to try to appeal to more users through a new strategy that emphasizes live video. The company has been entering partnerships for sports, politics and entertainment content — such as the National Football League’s Thursday night games — that it can stream alongside tweets related to the video. It may give people without Twitter accounts a new way to use the service, while allowing the company to share revenue on the video ads. Twitter’s user growth has ground to a halt in recent years, as its limited features have made the service attractive only to its core audience. Twitter shares closed at $19.85 on Friday, down $0.02 (-0.10%). Year-to-date, TWTR has fallen 14.22%, and is now more than 52% off its IPO day closing price of $41.65.

Mona Lalwani , @monalalwani 10.05.16 in Home Comments 1437 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Image credit: Google Home is the latest embodiment of a virtual assistant. The voice-activated speaker can help you make a dinner reservation, remind you to catch your flight, fire up your favorite playlist and even translate words for you on the fly. While the voice interface is expected to make quotidian tasks easier, it also gives the company unprecedented access to human patterns and preferences that are crucial to the next phase of artificial intelligence. Comparing an AI agent to a personal assistant, as most companies have been doing of late, makes for a powerful metaphor. It is one that is indicative of the human capabilities that most major technology companies want their disembodied helpers to adopt. Over the last couple of years, with improvements in speech-recognition technology, Siri, Cortana and Google Now have slowly learned to move beyond the basics of weather updates to take on more complex responsibilities like managing your calendar or answering your queries. But products that invade our personal spaces -- like Amazon's Echo and Google Home -- point to a larger shift in human-device interaction that is currently underway. Onstage demos of Google Home, which has the company's Assistant built into it, suggest a conversational capability that requires an advanced understanding of human intent and context. The device relies almost entirely on the company's speech-recognition technology that has been in the making for almost a decade, since the early days of GOOG 411. But over the years, the basic telephone-based directory search has grown into the much more complex Google Now. Amazon's Echo ecosystem relies on virtual assistant Alexa to respond to voice commands. The drastic jump in the Android assistant's capabilities has come from neural net training and deep learning techniques that have allowed scientists to boost speech-recognition technology to a point where it is now starting to learn the nuances of human behavior through the medium of voice. Using the voice to communicate with an outside entity makes for an intimate and innately human experience. "Speech is the most dominant way that humanity has been communicating with each other," David Nahamoo, speech CTO at IBM Research, said over the phone. "When we communicate with the outside, we speak. But from outside to inside, we absorb information a lot better visually. It's because of our heritage and the evolution that we have gone through. From the standpoint of efficiency, speech is quickest way to get a point across." "Voice changes the way people interact with their systems." - Françoise Beaufays, Google Devices like Echo and Google Home, for instance, are built on speech recognition that can help you stay heads-up and hands-free while you multitask around the house. So instead of spending time swiping and typing, you can tell the personal assistant what you need or what you're looking for. It's that kind of ease and productivity that companies dangle in front of the users to have them adopt chatbots and personal assistants in their daily communications, but talking to devices also opens the door to a new kind of relationship. "I think voice changes the way people interact with their systems," says Françoise Beaufays, a research scientist who works on speech recognition at Google. "For a long time when people were typing in their browsers for information, they would write something cryptic like 'Eiffel Tower height,' for example." The string of seemingly random words would instantly pull up search results on google.com with pictures, details and dimensions of the iconic French structure. But when speech recognition started to take shape with smartphone assistants, Beaufays says there was a clear change in communication. "As people started feeling comfortable with speech, instead of being cryptic they started saying: 'Hey, what is the height of the Eiffel Tower?' or 'How tall is the Eiffel Tower?'," she says. "We saw that switch in the way people were addressing their devices in speech first and typing next. Using your voice is bringing in more discursive type of interaction, and even though you know very well it's a machine you behave a little more human with it." A still from the movie Her (2013), directed by Spike Jonze. While a verbal exchange with a virtual assistant can make it easier to get things done, it also makes it easier for the companies to gain invaluable insight into the human world that's filled with vocal clues to feelings and preferences. "We're going from computing to understanding," says James Barrat, author of Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era. "It's not just us chatting. These machines are listening to what we like and don't like, how we speak and what we speak about. It's greater access to how we think." In the world of AI, data is the currency that will set one company apart from the other. Through voice searches, millions of vocal samples become available to the companies that are fine-tuning personal assistants. The stream of information is fed back into the system to improve the accuracy of the algorithms, but it also gives the companies access to the complexities of human intent. In effect, using the voice to communicate with an AI helper only makes it smarter. A lot can be gleaned from the vocal communication. Words and intonations start to give away user patterns, preferences and even emotions over time. That kind of insight into the mindset of the user is critical to the next wave of personalized AI that is already taking shape at companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook. Smart, talking AIs at home will fire up the ecosystem of the Internet of Things, taking it from novelty machines to necessities. With companies aspiring to make their assistants omnipresent and their machines more interconnectable, they need capable speech recognition to get the job done. "There's a parallel thrust," says Vlad Sejnoha, CTO at Nuance Communications, one of the leaders in voice-recognition technologies. "You'll interact with your smart fridge or printer in a more natural way but also see a portable personal assistant that lives in a cloud and follows you around to help you navigate a complex world." Google Home, much like Amazon's Echo, already comes with partnerships that are useful around the house. You can use the speaker to control your Chromecast, Nest and Philips Hue lights. In addition to navigating the immediate physical world, an omnipresent assistant could potentially become a gateway to unfamiliar settings or foreign languages too. In the spot aired during the Google event this week, the company demonstrated that Home has the ability to tap Google Translate to respond with accurate translations from English to Spanish. But whether the machine can comprehend foreign accents and translate the reverse, remains to be seen. "These machines are listening to what we like and don't like, how we speak and what we speak about. It's greater access to how we think." - James Barrat Failing to comprehend different accents has been one of the biggest downfalls of most digital assistants on smartphones today. Scientists building these systems often talk about the lack of data as one of the biggest obstacles to understanding new accents and languages. The copious amounts of information required to make that possible calls for massive investments from the companies. Taking the technology straight to people's homes opens up a steady stream of data that can be used for tests back in the research labs. A lot of the building blocks are starting to fall into place for devices like Google Home to become efficient personal assistants. And even though, there's a need to be more vigilant of the ways human-device interactions are starting to shift; most voice interface developers believe it's a necessary change that will extend human capabilities. "Having an AI that is your agent and helps you exist in the world better, gets you better information and services is hugely exciting," says Sejnoha.

Tech giants race for edge in artificial intelligence AFP 09/10/2016 Glenn Chapman © Provided by AFP Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets -- aiming to outdo Apple's Siri Major technology firms are racing to infuse smartphones and other internet-linked devices with software smarts that help them think like people. The effort is seen as an evolution in computing that allows users to interact with machines in natural conversation style, telling devices to tend to tasks such as ordering goods, checking traffic, making restaurant reservations or searching for information. The artificial intelligence (AI) component in these programs aims to make create a world in which everyone can have a virtual aide that gets to know them better with each interaction. Here are some of the offerings available: Google Google is making a high-profile push into AI, with the internet titan's chief referring to it as a force for change as powerful as powerful as smartphones. Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets -- aiming to outdo Apple's Siri -- enabling users to organize and use information on the devices and in the cloud -- to check emails, stay up to date on calendar appointments, news or ask for traffic and weather data. Google also offers AI through its Allo messaging application which can be installed on smartphones, and its Google Home hub, a standalone device similar to Amazon's Echo which responds to voice commands to manage tasks and fetch information where people live. Samsung © Provided by AFP Samsung moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri The South Korean electronics giant moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri. Samsung says the acquisition announced this month is part of its effort o provide AI-based voice assistance services its customers can use across all Samsung devices and products, from smartphones to televisions to washing machines. Samsung is world's leading maker of smartphones powered by Google's free Android software, but also has its own Tizen mobile operating system, so how it may field its own virtual assistant technology remains to be seen. Amazon Amazon in 2014 unveiled its Echo home assistant, a voice-activated speaker, powered by its "Alexa" artificial intelligence program. Users can ask for news or information updates, as well as ordering goods from the online retail giant. Echo also serves as a connected-home hub which can control compatible appliances, lightbulbs and other devices. Since introducing Echo, Amazon has launched a smaller version called "Dot" and integrated Alexa into its Fire TV devices. Microsoft Microsoft's personal assistant uses the name Cortana and is available on Windows devices and its Xbox console and as an application on Apple iOS and Android devices. Unveiled in 2014, Cortana -- a name based on a character in its blockbuster game "Halo" -- responds to conversationally spoken requests or commands, using insights gleaned from calendars, contact lists, online searches and other smartphone sources to respond in a manner akin to a real-life aide. Facebook © Provided by AFP Facebook is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename "M" Facebook, heavily investing in artificial intelligence, is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename "M." The social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to create a real-life version of "Jarvis," the assistant in the assistant in the Marvel Comics series "Iron Man." For now, Facebook is enabling AI-powered "bots" on its Messenger mobile application that allows users to get answers to questions and engage in text exchanges as though chatting with the social network itself. Apple Apple was the first to offer its personal assistant, introducing Siri for the iPhone in 2011, and has been working to improve it over the years. Recently, Siri was upgraded to interact with non-Apple applications, so users can book a ride with Lyft or make payments using Square Cash. Apple has also introduced a Home application that can connect with smart appliances and other devices, and is reportedly working on a standalone speaker similar to Amazon Echo and Google Home. IBM Technology stalwart IBM made headlines nearly 20 years ago with "Deep Blue" software that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov at his own game, and more recently with "Watson" artificial intelligence that triumphed over top human players in a Jeopardy television game show. IBM has put Watson to work making business systems and services smarter with data and customers. Thousands of people are expected to attend a World of Watson conference later this month in Las Vegas.

Skip to content Turkey Blocks Mapping Internet Freedom in Real Time Menu Organization Methodology Press Contact Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive cloud services blocked in Turkey following leaks Posted on October 8, 2016October 16, 2016 by Editorial 5kSHARES ShareTweet Turkey has blocked access to Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive and partially restricted Google Drive cloud file sharing services popular on mobile phones as well as in education, business, legal and press industries, following the leak by hacktivist group Redhack of a set of private emails allegedly belonging to Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak, son-in-law of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. At the time of writing, Saturday 8 October, both Google Drive and Dropbox services were issuing SSL errors, indicating intercepted traffic at the national or ISP level. Microsoft OneDrive was also subsequently blocked off throughout Turkey: Microsoft @Onedrive now blocked in #Turkey, joining @GoogleDrive and @Dropbox in nationwide cloud storage shutdownhttps://t.co/xObmf8D00j pic.twitter.com/Kmc8761iH9 — Turkey Blocks (@TurkeyBlocks) October 8, 2016 The BTK authority subsequently released an official block notice for Google Drive, although no such notice was posted for Dropbox: After technical analysis and legal consideration based on the Law Nr. 5651, ADMINISTRATION MEASURE has been taken for this website (drive.google.com) according to Decision Nr.490.05.01.2016.-156393 dated 08/10/2016 implemented by Information and Communication Technologies Authority.BTK / ICTA Affected ISPs include TTNet, UyduNet and Turkcell. Foreign visitors in Turkey using roaming mobile data are still able to access the services because their data is tunnelled to the country of origin. Knock-on effects expected Dropbox Inc, a privately held company whose board of directors includes former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, has not yet commented on the block. Google Drive is a Google service that also integrates with other platforms – the loss of access may therefore have a knock-on impact on third-party products. Another site, the GitHub Open Source developer portal, relied on by many technology systems and startups, was blocked the following morning: Confirmed: Major Open Source infrastructure site @Github blocked in #Turkey 12:14PM to suppress #Redhack mail leakhttps://t.co/xObmf8D00j pic.twitter.com/geb5t0tH6X — Turkey Blocks (@TurkeyBlocks) October 9, 2016 The blocks are expected to heavily impact Google users and Dropbox Inc. customers who use the respective mobile applications, which runs on Android, iPhone as well as desktop computers, to archive their photos, share business documents and sign contracts.

Limited transparency Turkey had not issued a formal restriction order on the site as of evening Saturday 8 October 2016: While Dropbox is entirely blocked, Google Drive is still accessible to existing users – possibly because Google shares its business cloud hosting infrastructure and servers between Drive and it’s primary services including search. Official government blocking measure for Microsoft OneDrive TurkeyBlocks is working to collect forensic data captures of the incident. Most, but not all service providers were affected at the time of writing – the services appear to still accessible to a small number of users in the country not using the main providers. 5kSHARES ShareTweet Tweets by TurkeyBlocks Search for: Recent Posts Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and WhatsApp shutdown in Turkey New internet shutdown in Turkey’s Southeast: 8% of country now offline amidst Diyarbakir unrest Internet shutdown in Turkey’s Southeast following mayor’s detention Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive cloud services blocked in Turkey following leaks Internet shutdown in Turkey’s Southeast Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 Categories Incident Report Keep Updated Copyright © 2016 Turkey Blocks
Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Chrome 55 memory improvements By Martin Brinkmann on October 9, 2016 in Google Chrome - Last Update:October 9, 2016 13 The web browser Google Chrome 55 will use less memory thanks to improvements made to the browser's JavaScript engine. Memory use may be one of the deciding factors when it comes to selecting a browser. While it may not play a big role on systems with plenty of RAM, say 4 Gigabyte or more, it is still a hot topic on systems with less. Google Chrome is known for its memory hunger. If you open ten sites in Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge, you will likely notice that Chrome requires the most memory. You may check and control memory use in Chrome in various ways, for instance by installing extensions like Tab Limiter. Chrome 55 memory improvements Google announced recently that Chrome 55 will ship with memory improvements that reduce the browser's memory hunger. The first part of the announcement details how Google tracked and measured the improvements. While interesting from a technical point of view, the first couple of paragraphs offer little information on the improvements. The sites that Google benchmarked memory usage on includes several important properties including Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Imgur, Flipboard and the New York Times. Google highlights two main areas of improvement in the second half of the post: JavaScript Heap Size Reduction, and Zone Memory Reduction. The first improves memory usage on low-memory devices through the introduction of a memory reduction mode that fine-tunes garbage collection heuristics to lower memory usage of the JavaScript garbage collected heap. Google noticed an average heap size reduction of 50% when it ran benchmark tests on Chrome 53 and 55. The second memory related improvement that went into Chrome 55 benefits the browser on all devices. One of the main improvements in regards to Zone Memory comes "from reducing memory consumption during background parsing" according to Google. Background parsing allows the JavaScript engine of Chrome to parse JavaScript scripts while the page is loaded. Google noticed that the parser would keep zones alive longer than necessary. The company's engineers changed the duration which resulted in "reduced average and peak memory usage" in Chrome. Improvements are noticeable on all sites Google used to benchmark the improvements. Closing Words The reductions look impressive on first glance, but it remains to be seen if users will notice similar memory use improvements when their version of Chrome is updated to version 55. Users who don't want to wait can download the Dev or  Canary version of Chrome which are already at version 55 and 56 respectively to see if they notice improvements when using the browser. Google plans to release Chrome 55 to the release channel in December 2016.       Summary Article Name Chrome 55 memory improvements Description The web browser Google Chrome 55 will use less memory thanks to improvements made to the browser's JavaScript engine.

Opera introduced it on their Dev version, and it DOES NOT work, Opera Dev's memory footprint just keeps ballooning, reaching 2.5 - 3 Gb in 1 session !! In my view HSR is just marketing hype. Reply bwat47 October 10, 2016 at 5:15 pm # that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with heap size reduction, could just be a bug in the dev version or something Reply flyli5411 October 9, 2016 at 1:22 pm # Been using SlimJet browser now for few months ,Basically half memory compared to Firefox and Chrome ,Also just a really nice browser with lots of customizations etc. Reply Anonymous October 9, 2016 at 2:06 pm # Would be also nice to see memory consumption comparison between Chrome 55, Opera and Firefox 50 (when it's going to be released once in November). Reply Kubrick. October 9, 2016 at 2:08 pm # my experience with chrome on linux in terms of memory usage has always been encouraging.Naturally if more tabs are opened then memory usage will increase and this is by chrome design.For goodness sake if you have 4-8gb ram then why worry about memory usage,it is what memory is for, Reply Parker Lewis October 9, 2016 at 4:07 pm # I've heard this argument expressed so many times. Some people have little memory, some people have to run huge programs concurrently. If programmers were all as liberal with RAM as users who believe in this kind of arguments, it's not 8Gb that we would need to have a fast computer with apps that don't crash. (The consequence of a lack of RAM is not just an unusably slow computer, it's crashes too.) This can be (somewhat) illustrated by some low RAM Android phones. Android is pretty liberal with RAM because it "believes" in its ability to keep it fully in use and manage it without speed loss or app crashes. But if your phone has less than 1GB you will have to close apps manually if you want your phone to stay snappy. Apps will then be slower to start, but will work better and crash less. So yes, IMO an unnecessarily RAM hungry app is simply badly designed. Reply PBo October 9, 2016 at 11:12 pm # I agree. Switching between several projects and activities, I can easily have several dozens tabs and browser windows open simultaneously. I use different desktops to accomodate different activities. I often see 7 or 8 GB virtual memory used only by browsers and had to buy another 8GB of RAM just for that. This is eventually partially swapped. However, RAM is not the only issue. The permanent usage of 1 to 8% CPU by each browser can add up to more than 20% CPU being used for nothing by minimized windows for long as the computer is not asleep, so 12 hours a day. The global javascript switch doesn't prevent it any more in Firefox and firefox-based browsers after version 27 or 28. Why ? I have now been stuck for years at version 27. It's not extensions because it's the same all extensions disabled. In chrome and derived browsers, I have found no working global javascript switching extension. When will a browser integrate this option that scripts be stopped in background or minimized windows, please ???? I don't pay for electricity, CPUs and laptop batteries to have them spoilt this way. Rudolf Hunk October 9, 2016 at 10:56 pm # I upgraded to version 55 and my Chrome now uses more memory than ever? :P Reply Taomyn October 10, 2016 at 9:55 am # How about Google fixes their damned cached file system as well? I have some heavily used machines and their Windows profiles include Chrome folders nearly 10GB in size and nearly a million files. This is just crazy as the only way to clear it is to completely clear the file system and thus losing valuable site information. It also makes regular virus/malware scans ten times longer than they need to be. Reply Ben October 10, 2016 at 12:56 pm # They should allow the "one process" flag that is in chromium instead of disabling it. Reply Anonymous October 13, 2016 at 3:17 am # Do you have this info for Firefox as an comparison?

Google Posts Official Samples Taken with Pixel’s “Best Smartphone Camera Ever” GO The images were captured with the 12.3MP camera on Pixel Oct 9, 2016 09:41 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google recently announced two smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, manufactured together with HTC. While rear camera capacity on the two smartphones isn’t the highest on the market, Google promised that the devices come with the best smartphone camera on the market. To back up its claims, the company mentioned that Pixel cameras received the highest score ever from DxOMark, an industry standard for cameras and lens image quality measurements and ratings. Pixel cameras scored 89 points, slightly higher than Apple’s iPhone 7. To show off the camera’s capabilities, Google posted several images taken by Isaac Reynolds, Google’s camera product executive. The collection of images with the “#NoFilter needed” tagline are available for download on Google Photos. They show the Pixel camera’s capacity to perform under multiple lighting conditions. Pixel phones come with a 12.3MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture The images don’t seem to have been uploaded from a Pixel unit, as they lack EXIF data. Still, considering the clarity that each image offers, the pictures clearly don’t need any filters. The rear camera on the Pixel smartphones comes with a 12.3MP capacity, f/2.0 aperture, and the ability to record 4k videos at 30fps or 1080p videos at 120fps. The DxOMark study showed that the smartphone provides accurate exposure with good contrast and white balance. However, it may have some inconsistencies when it comes to repeated autofocus. Other cons to the rear camera concern video recording, which could result in motion blur on walking scenes in low-light conditions. As for the other features on the phones, Pixel comes with a 5.0-inch FHD AMOLED display and a 2,770mAh battery. It also has 4GB of RAM and runs a quad-core Snapdragon 821 processor. Front camera capacity reaches 8MP with f/2.4 aperture and fixed focus. The Pixel XL, on the other hand, is slightly larger, with a 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED display, and battery capacity is also higher at 3,450mAh. The smartphones will be officially released on October 20, but they’re already available for pre-order on Verizon, Google Store and Best Buy.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (5 Images) #Google#Pixel#Pixel XL#Camera samples#DxOMark subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Pixel camera samples (5 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Verizon to Handle System Updates on Pixel Phones, While Google Security Updates Google Pixel Battery Life Is 40% Higher than Nexus Smartphones Google Pixel Phones Come with Fewer Pre-Installed Verizon Apps Google Pixel and Pixel XL Phones Will Work on Republic Wireless Network 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android Ubuntu Touch OTA-14 Slightly Delayed, New Task Manager Gets Fuzzy Background 5 photos    Camera sample from Pixel phones New Android APKs Navbar Apps APK: Updated November 13th, 17:48 GMT MiXplorer APK: Updated November 13th, 17:46 GMT Periscope APK: Updated November 13th, 17:43 GMT XDA Labs APK: Updated November 13th, 17:38 GMT Game Tools APK: Updated November 13th, 17:35 GMT SoundHound APK: Updated November 13th, 17:33 GMT Microsoft Classroom APK: Updated November 13th, 17:17 GMT Reader comments Load old comments   LG G5 Starts Receiving Android 7.0 Nougat Update more on: LG G5 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

October 4 AAPL: 113.00 0.48 Google unveils Pixel & Pixel XL w/ Siri-like Assistant, claims ‘best ever’ mobile camera rated above iPhone 7 Jordan Kahn - 1 month ago @JordanKahn Google View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Today at its press event to unveil its new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, a rebranding of its Nexus-line of devices, Google also took the wraps off new features coming to its Assistant and Home platforms and more. The company highlighted claims that its new smartphones have the best camera of any mobile device yet, including comparing it to the new iPhone 7 camera. The new Pixel phones are an evolution of Google’s previous Nexus line of Android phones with the company having more control over the manufacturing and branding of the device than in previous years, but they are still partnering with HTC behind the scenes. The Pixel phones are the first to come with Google’s new Assistant platform that it first unveiled earlier this year during its Google I/O event. The company also highlighted the fact that it built the phone to be ready for mobile virtual reality with its Daydream platform, and it’s offering users of the device unlimited full quality photo and video storage in the cloud. As for its claims of “the best smartphone camera”, Google pointed out a DXOMark rating of 89 for the Pixel’s 12.3 megapixel rear camera, which it says makes the Pixel’s camera the best ever in a smartphone. Google highlighted that claim while comparing it to the iPhone 7 (pictured below), but it didn’t include the iPhone 7 Plus…: That might be because DXOMark has only released results for the iPhone 7 so far. If Google’s claim of the best smartphone camera ever is only based on its DXOMark rating, it could soon have some competition from the iPhone 7 Plus’ rating.

October 4 AAPL: 113.00 0.48 Comment: Google just couldn’t leave Apple out of its iPhone competitor keynote Zac Hall - 1 month ago @apollozac iPhone Google View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Google’s keynote today was knocked by some observers for having a similar style to Apple keynotes: a funny video to start things off, an intro from the CEO to set the stage, and product leaders announcing new products that they work on. I don’t really buy into that as a critique. Apple usually does an impressive keynote; they use a format that other companies should copy. Something else that stood out is Google’s habit of using subtle references to Apple critiques to pitch its products. That’s just not very Apple. There was a reference to ‘bumping phones’ a few years ago when Apple introduced AirDrop, but Apple tastefully avoided any combustion jokes when it introduced the iPhone 7 last month. Google, on the other hand, just couldn’t leave Apple out of its keynote. Google’s Apple dings weren’t just limited to the easy headphone jack reference either. Three things I picked up at the start: Google said customers want “more than 1,000 songs in your pocket” now; that’s a reference to Steve Jobs’ iPod introduction Google said “our products just work” which sounds like a play on Jobs’ “it just works” line about Apple products Google described its Pixel smartphone as having “no unsightly camera bump” which iPhones do have (and a lot of Android phones too) The ‘1,000 songs in your pocket’ line seemed to be in the context of technology changing, but it didn’t come across as especially necessary considering the availability of streaming music services from a variety of companies not named Google. Describing products that “just work” is surely meant to be a slight against Apple services, and the camera bump line is odd considering how unattractive so many Android camera bumps are. Speaking of the camera, Google’s new Pixel phone touts a DxOMark score of 89, which it says is the highest ever for any smartphone. For context, the iPhone 7 recently scored an 86 and the rating for the dual-camera system on the iPhone 7 Plus is “coming soon.” Clearly Google and DxOMark coordinated the test and slide as it was included before the phone’s official announcement and included in the keynote, but it seems highly possible that the iPhone 7 Plus could also score an 89 if not higher. It’s unclear if DxOMark will wait for iOS 10.1 which includes the DSLR-like depth effect feature too. DxOMark seems to be ignoring the iPhone completely when describing the quality of the Pixel camera: “Overall, the Pixel did extremely well in capturing our natural test images, typically performing as well or better than other current flagship models. However, on our greenery test scene below, it didn’t perform as well as some of the other flagship phones, as it lost details in the shadows.” It used the HTC 10 and Samsung Galaxy S7 (both rated 88) for reference, but Pixel seems targeted in part at iPhone switchers with its premium price. Google even touts how easy it is to switch from iPhone. Then there’s the cheesy color names to discuss. We expected these but it’s even more cringeworthy to see on stage: Quite Black, Really Blue, and Very Silver. Contrast that with Apple’s iPhone 7 color lineup: Jet Black, Black, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold. You can joke that Jet Black and Black is silly, but Quite, Really, and Very come across as self-parodying or self-deprecating, not serious. What’s wrong with black, silver, and blue? Speaking of not serious, I can’t help but think that Android phone makers are going to regret mocking the iPhone 7’s lack of a headphone jack in a few short years. For starters, iPhone wasn’t the first smartphone to drop the headphone jack, it was merely the first to popularize it on smartphones. Motorola beat Apple to the punch in 2016. It also seems plausible that most if not all smartphones could drop the headphone jack in a few years. USB-C audio is positioned to do what Lightning is doing on iOS, and wireless Bluetooth audio is cross-platform. But Google is using ‘3.5mm headphone jack’ as a feature on a spec sheet now. This wasn’t even worth a mention before the iPhone 7, right? Headphone jack is the new “runs Flash!” — Zac Hall (@apollozac) October 4, 2016 It reminds me of the situation with Adobe Flash several years ago. iOS never adopted Flash support due to performance, battery life, and security; Android touted Flash support (with the aforementioned issues) on mobile as a feature in ads and Flash still died. Listing the headphone jack on a spec sheet and advertising it as ‘surprisingly not new’ will look just as dated in a matter of years. (So will pitching your new phone as being so new it doesn’t have a version number. I’m waiting for the Pixel 2.) You could nitpick at the Pixel design too: it has the antenna lines that Apple just hid, the front has the chin of an iPhone 5 with the Touch ID-style fingerprint scanner moved to the back, and there’s no premium curved display like Samsung phones despite its premium price. It’s also not immediately evident that Google Assistant is superior to Siri. I use Siri a lot and noticed that most if not all of the demos for Google Assistant would work just as well using Siri since 2011. Sending a message, booking dinner with OpenTable, playing a song. Google’s contextual awareness of what’s on-screen is different but not new to Pixel. One thing Google does get right is unlimited photo and video storage in the cloud when you buy its Pixel phone. By comparison, iPhones come with 5GB of free iCloud storage with paid accounts for up to 2TB available. I really wonder what stops Apple from using unlimited photo and video storage as a reason for customers to buy its iPhones. Surely there’s not a significant amount of revenue from iCloud storage upgrades from photo sync alone. Google couldn’t pitch this feature either without reminding us of Apple. Google Photos ads are especially fond of the iOS ‘storage is full’ dialog box. It costs $2.99 a month to access my iCloud Photo Library on my 256GB iPhone 7 and I’m inching closer to needing the $9.99 a month 1TB tier. I’ll give Google that one.

By Dave Snelling / Published 10th October 2016 APPLE/GOOGLE RIVALS: Google has just announced its new Pixel smartphone Google is pretty confident that its new Pixel phone is going to be a big hit. With a AMOLED HD screen, decent camera, fast processor and premium design it's certainly got plenty going for it. Google is also including an easy way for iPhone owners to transfer their digital life from iOS to Android and is hoping Apple fans will jump ship. The Pixel is available for pre-order now with prices starting from a hefty £599 but before you make the switch here's seven things the Pixel can't do over its Apple rival. HERE'S 7 THINGS THE iPHONE CAN DO THAT THE PIXEL CAN'T Google major announcement in pictures - all the gadgets coming from Google Wednesday, 5th October 2016 GOOGLE has announced a host of new products including its new Pixel smartphone. 1 / 8 GOOGLE Google Pixel phone 1. TAKE IN THE BATH Google's Pixel can survive the odd splash of rain but dropping it down the loo could cause you a tech headache. Apple recently made their iPhone 7 and 7 Plus water resistant and it can now cope with a thorough soaking. In fact, Apple says users shouldn't have any issues with a 30-minute dip with their iPhone. .................................. 2. CAMERA ZOOM Google made a big song and dance about the Pixel's new camera including boasting that it's scored the highest marks ever from the famous DXO image tests. Daily Star Online hasn't tested this new camera yet but we do know one thing it doesn't have that the iPhone does. The new iPhone 7 Plus includes a dual lens which allows users to zoom when taking pictures. And we're not talking a pixel-busting digital zoom as the iPhone 7 Plus features a 2X optical zoom. This dual lens is also capable of taking pictures with depth of field making your smartphone snaps look like they've been taken on a pro camera. GOOGLE ON DISPLAY: Google's Pixel doesn't feature a Force Touch display DAILY STAR ONLINE Apple iPhone waterproof test 3. iOS 10 Android is getting much more user friendly and the Pixel features Google's very latest version of its Nougat software. However, Apple's iOS is still the easiest operating system to navigate and if you've got a Mac or an iPad you'll find it hard to switch to Android. Apps and games such as Nintendo's Super Mario Run often launch on iOS first, which is another reason to stick firmly with the iPhone. .................................. 4. FORCE TOUCH Apple introduced its Force Touch display last year and it's still one of the only smartphones on the market with this technology. Force Touch allows you to apply pressure to the screen to get quick access to features within apps and the iPhone's settings. Although the Pixel includes a super-sharp AMOLED display it doesn't feature any pressure sensitive tricks. APPLE GOOGLE/APPLE FEATURES: The iPhone will go head-to-head with Google's new Pixel 5. HUGE STORAGE Google is offering unlimited free cloud storage for anyone buying its Pixel but, unlike some of its Android rivals, it hasn't included expandable storage on the actual device. Although Apple doesn't have anyway of increasing memory, it has launched an iPhone with a whopping 256GB of storage which is double that of Google's biggest Pixel. .................................. 6. STEREO SPEAKERS It may not have a headphone port but the iPhone does has an incredible pair of stereo speakers. GETTY FANS: The iPhone brand is now nine years old and has a faithful army of loyal followers 7. iPHONE FACTOR Google has priced its Pixel in direct competition with Apple's iPhone and this could be its biggest hurdle. The iPhone is now nine years old and has a faithful army of loyal fans. With A-list celebs often caught using Apple's smartphone it's also still seen as the must-have device to own. Google is taking a big risk by pricing their Pixel so high and convincing fans to switch could be a tall order.

And, in a clear sign it wants to lure users, Google showed off a new feature to move content such as photos, contacts and settings from an iPhone.   They are even including a lead in the box to connect a Pixel to an iPhone.   Crucially, Google and EE, the network selling the devices, plan a multimillion-pound marketing campaign that will see the Pixel splashed across adverts on TV, in print and on billboards. An insider said: “By Christmas everyone will have heard of these phones.”   Not only do the Pixel phones look like the iPhone 7, they have similar features — detailed screens, top-of-the-range cameras and powerful processors.   They don’t, however, have the dual-lens camera of the bigger 7 Plus. Pixel handsets also feature Google Assistant, a new voice­activated virtual personal assistant that promises to answer questions and help organise users’ days for them.   Google reckons it is smarter than Apple’s similar Siri service.   When demonstrated on stage, the feature let Pixel offer details on a restaurant mentioned in a text message conversation — offering contact details, photos and directions.   Google drew laughs when it announced the Pixel devices have a headphone jack.   They also come with unlimited “cloud” storage, a service where you can back-up your photos, videos, contacts and emails on Google’s computers.   It is similar to Apple’s iCloud but that has a charge once you max out your free allowance. Many say they don’t swap phones because of the hassle of moving settings between rival devices, which is a key issue when switching between iPhones and devices running Android.   To help make that easier, Google has come up with the new software and thrown in a cable adapter.   The Pixel, with a 5in screen, and Pixel XL, which has a 5.5in one, are out on October 20 and can be pre-ordered from EE.   On two-year contracts, the Pixel is free on a £50.99 a month deal and the XL on £55.99. They come with unlimited minutes, texts and 10GB of data.   The phone can also be bought sim-free from £599 with 32GB of storage up to £819 with 128GB from Google or from Carphone Warehouse, which will also offer the phone on contracts with other networks.   Google has been involved in handsets before, under the Nexus name, but these are the first the company has fully designed.   And they are first to come under the “Phone by Google” branding.   The Nexus devices were produced with manufacturers including LG and Huawei and were not sold or marketed widely.

Companies like Samsung, LG, HTC and others didn't care - they were pushing their own proprietary features onto Android. And to be fair, Google adopted many of those innovations into the core OS. Still, the search giant wanted more control and it got it. The Pixel and Pixel XL bring the full Android experience. Google Allo and Duo handle messaging, Assistant helps with everyday tasks, Daydream gets into the emerging VR market, Google Photos stores your captures, Google Assistant collaborates with the Google Home hub to answer your questions and control your smart home. They have high-end hardware with sharp AMOLED screens, Snapdragon 821 chipsets, advanced 12MP cameras and HTC-built metal bodies. Clearly, Google positioned the Pixels as premium devices, as premium as Apple's iPhone. But can they actually compete? A OnePlus 3, ZTE Axon 7, Xiaomi Mi 5 and many others offer most of the same hardware at half the price. Android flagships add perks like wireless charging, OIS, water resistance and so on - not vital, but if you're going to pay $650+ you shouldn't accept compromises. Not to mention things like a microSD slot or a removable battery. So, which is it? Will the Pixels make Google more like Apple? Or will it go the way of Lumia?

   Main Contact us hitechchronicle.com Navigation Business Culture Technology Science Sport Worldwide Medicine National Technology Chromecast Ultra is still value for money despite the twofold price increase Oct 09 2016 After weeks of rumors and leaks about its specs and appearance, Google's new Chromecast Ultra has finally gotten its reveal, and right on the date suggested. Google Home is set to arrive in stores in November and is now up for pre-orders at $129 via the Google Store, Walmart, Target, and Best Buy. At a press event today, Google introduced a higher-end Chromecast video streaming device, adding 4K and HDR support to the offering. A Wi-Fi router will pretty much do the job decently, but keep in mind that Chromecast Ultra boasts 4K video streaming, a much heavier stream than Full HD. The new Chromecast Ultra generation of devices will be able to stream 4k content - which is the latest available resolution on the market - from media services such as Netflix, Vudu, and Youtube. That makes it a really important device in the bigger picture of Google's aspirations. The new Chromecast is 1.8 times faster than the 1080P model, it includes better WiFi connectivity and there is an ethernet port in the power adapter if you need a wired connection to stream your 4K content. Interestingly, Google Chromecast Ultra is nearly twice as fast at streaming content compared to the company's first generation Chromecast. Unlike Google, however, the company's newest devices only support the HDR10 format, and the same goes for Nvidia's Shield TV, Microsoft new Xbox One S, Sony's upcoming PlayStation 4 Pro and the recent PS4 firmware update. The leading name in this segment of 4K-capable products is Google's very own Chromecast. Google has announced that Google Play Movies will stream 4K content from November. Users can still mirror content to their TV from their Android smartphone or from their laptop's Chrome browser. This new device allows premium media streaming if you're willing to pay a little extra. Every since the Chromecast was released, it's been hailed as a good device because of its pricing and its features. Chance are that if you use a 4K tv, then your internet connection would also be top-speed. Instead of casting a Spotify playlist from the app on your iPhone (which drains your phone's battery) you can instead say "OK Google, play Beyoncé on my Chromecast", and let Google's Assistant do the rest.

Public domain image. Not knowing the local language can be hell — but Google’s new translation software might prove to be the bilingual travel partner you’re always wanted. A recently released paper notes that Google’s Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT) reduces translation errors by an average of 60% compared to the familiar phrase-based approach. The framework is based on unsupervised deep learning technology. Deep learning simulates the way our brains form connections and process information inside a computer. Virtual neurons are mapped out by a program, and the connections between them receive a numerical value, a “weight”. The weight determines how each of these virtual neurons treats data imputed to it — low-weight neurons recognize the basic features of data, which they feed to the heavier neurons for further processing, and so on. The end goal is to create a software that can learn to recognize patterns in data and respond to each one accordingly. Programmers train these frameworks by feeding them data, such as digitized images or sound waves. They rely on big sets of training data and powerful computers to work effectively, which are becoming increasingly available. Deep learning has proven its worth in image and speech recognition in the past, and adapting it to translation seems like the logical next step. And it works like a charm Advertisement GNMT draws on 16 processors to transform words into a value called “vector.” This represents how closely it relates to other words in its training database — 2.5 billion sentence pairs for English and French, and 500 million for English and Chinese. “Leaf” is more related to “tree” than to “car”, for example, and the name “George Washington” is more related to “Roosevelt” than to “Himalaya”, for example. Using the vectors of the input words, the system chooses a list of possible translations, ranked based on their probability of occurrence. Cross-checking helps improve overall accuracy. The increased accuracy in translation happened because Google let their neural network do without much of the previous supervision from programmers. They fed the initial data, but let the computer take over from there, training itself. This approach is called unsupervised learning, and has proven to be more efficient than previous supervised learning techniques, where humans held a large measure of control on the learning process. In a series of tests pitting the system against human translators, it came close to matching their fluency for some languages. Bilingually fluent people rated the system between 64 and 87 percent better than the previous one. While some things still slip through GNMT’s fingers, such as slang or colloquialisms, those are some solid results. Google is already using the new system for Chinese to English translation, and plans to completely replace it’s current translation software with GNMT.   Like us on Facebook Independent science reporting, always spot on.

The US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany and India are all ahead of us in the queue. Google says it plans to sell the phones in more countries, but offers no further details. There’s also no news about when the creepy Google Home speaker will come here. The marketing says the phones are made by Google. That’s not true. HTC makes them. The company struggles to sell phones under its own name, so the contract will be a relief. Priced like an Apple Google is betting its brand carries as much weight with customers as Apple or Samsung. It asks Apple and Samsung-like prices. In the US, the cheapest Pixel costs US$650. That’s the same as the cheapest Apple iPhone 7. Samsung prices are similar. Google propaganda says it “obsessed over every detail, from the industry design to the user experience” of the Pixels. The words sound like something Steve Jobs might have said. Guru The phones include a 12.3 mega-pixel camera. Google says its “photography gurus” spent a year optimising the camera. There’s also a quick-charge battery that can deliver 7 hours of use on a charge of 15 minutes. That’s useful if you forget to charge overnight and need to get to work in a hurry. Google’s latest foray into branded hardware follows earlier failures. Google Glass was a flop. The brief dalliance with Motorola was unhappy. Google bought Nest but failed to capitalise on it. On the other hand, the earlier Google-branded Nexus phones are among the best Androids. Not really about hardware Most of the attention on the Pixel phone announcement centres on yet another Google move into hardware. The company sees integrating phone hardware and software, in the way Apple does with the iPhone, gives it an edge over other phone makers. This integration is an idea Google had been quick to dismiss in the past. It may not have escaped your attention that those other phone makers are supposed to be Google’s partners. They are the companies who make Android phones. Tension in the Android camp To suggest this could be a source of tension between Google and the companies making Android phones is putting it mildly. Relationships between Google and phone makers, especially Samsung, have never been entirely cordial. But this is a stab in the back. When Microsoft first moved into hardware with the Surface Pro tablets it went to great lengths not to tread on its partner’s toes. It made soothing noises about its strategy. Officially the Surface was only there to show them the way. Even today Microsoft chooses not to compete head-on with the big PC maker’s main product lines. How to win friends and influence them In contrast Google seems content to trample on partners. One fear is that it wants to displace its Android partners in their relationships with mobile carriers. In Australia Google formed an exclusive relationship with Telstra - that’s moving right in on Samsung’s turf. At the same time it seems to be undermining the Android value chain. As you’d expect from Google, the Pixel phones are more about software than hardware. Google Assistant, an artificial intelligence-based digital assistant, is preloaded on Pixel phones. Siri competition On one level Google Assistant is a direct competitor with Apple’s Siri. The phone software is, in effect, a client to back-end services provided by Google. It is a way of tieing the hardware more closely to the search giant. Google Assistant also cuts rival phone makers out of an important part of the value chain. It links straight back to Google’s data centres. It leaves little room for other Android phone makers to enter the services market. If phone makers lie awake at night worrying about Pixel, privacy advocates and, perhaps the rest of us, will lose sleep over Google’s surveillance. Data mining The new Pixel phones are one part of a strategy to help Google collect more data and more intimate data than ever before. At the same announcement the company took the wraps off Google Home. It is a home speaker with a built-in microphone. Home includes a voice-activated version of Google Assistant and can link to internet-of-things devices in your home. Google Home is always listening. It is the ultimate surveillance devices prettied up as a domestic appliance. It would require a near impossible feat of willpower not to feed it with a constant steam of the most personal and intimate data. When George Orwell wrote 1984 he never dreamed that Big Brother could get citizens to buy the listening devices spying on them. The idea of then earning billions by using it to learn their preferences and selling them more things was beyond belief. The clever-sounding artificial intelligence Google talks of isn’t there to help you. It’s not to make life better, to ease your burdens. It exists to mine your most intimate data then sell it to retailers who can turn it into gold. If that doesn’t worry you, nothing will.

A horse to a carpenter is an implement of work. A horse to a gymnast is an implement on which to perform certain exercises. One of the limitations of information on the Web is that it is organized differently at each site on the Web. As a newly granted Google patent notes, there is no official catalog of information available on the internet, and each site has its own organizational system. Search engines exist to index information, but they have issues, as described in this new patent that make finding information challenging. Limitations on Conventional Keyword-Based Search Engines The patent granted to Google, in September of 2016, discusses a way to organize information on the Web in a manner which can help to better organize and index that information, using context vectors to better understand how words are being used. The patent describes limitations of search engines that are based upon indexing content using keywords, such as: A search engine working with Conventional keyword searching will return all instances of the keyword being searched for, regardless of how that word is used on a site. This can be a lot of results Conventional search engines may only return only the home page of a site that contains the keyword. Finding where the keyword is used on the site could be difficult Often a conventional search engine will return a list of URLs in response to a keyword search that may be difficult to modify or search further in a meaningful manner. Information obtained through a search can become dated quickly. Such information may need to be checked up upon The patent tells us about those limitations and also points out some of the limitations of directories that could also be used to help find information. It then goes on to provide a possible solution to this problem, with a “data extraction tool” capable of providing many of the benefits of both search engines and directories, without the drawbacks that this patent points out. Is this The Google Search Engine with RankBrain Inside? A search engine based on a data extraction tool like the one described in the patent would be an improvement over most search engines. Is this Google’s search engine with RankBrain applied to it? It’s possible that it is, though it doesn’t use the word RankBrain The Bloomberg introduction to RankBrain, Google Turning Its Lucrative Web Search Over to AI Machines provides information about the algorithm used in RankBrain, and it tells us: RankBrain uses artificial intelligence to embed vast amounts of written language into mathematical entities — called vectors — that the computer can understand. This new patent refers to what it calls Context Vectors to index content about words found on the Web. To put it clearly, the patent tells us: In view of the foregoing, in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, a method and apparatus are disclosed in one embodiment of the present invention for determining contexts of information analyzed. Contexts may be determined for words, expressions, and other combinations of words in bodies of knowledge such as encyclopedias. Analysis of use provides a division of the universe of communication or information into domains and selects words or expressions unique to those domains of subject matter as an aid in classifying information. A vocabulary list is created with a macro-context (context vector) for each, dependent upon the number of occurrences of unique terms from a domain, over each of the domains. This system may be used to find information or classify information by subsequent inputs of text, in calculation of macro-contexts, with ultimate determination of lists of micro-contests including terms closely aligned with the subject matter. When a search submits a query to a search engine, we are told that the search engine may try to give it contexts based upon “other queries from the same user, the query associated with other information or query results from the same use, or other inputs related to that user to give it more context. The patent is: User-context-based search engine Inventors: David C. Taylor Application Date: 09/04/2012 Grant Number: 09449105 Grant Date: 09/20/2016 Abstract: A method and apparatus for determining contexts of information analyzed. Contexts may be determined for words, expressions, and other combinations of words in bodies of knowledge such as encyclopedias. Analysis of use provides a division of the universe of communication or information into domains and selects words or expressions unique to those domains of subject matter as an aid in classifying information. A vocabulary list is created with a macro-context (context vector) for each, dependent upon the number of occurrences of unique terms from a domain, over each of the domains. This system may be used to find information or classify information by subsequent inputs of text, in calculation of macro-contexts, with ultimate determination of lists of micro-contests including terms closely aligned with the subject matter. When RankBrain was first announced, I found a patent that was co-invented by one of the members of the team that was working on it, that described how Google might provide substitutions for some query terms, based upon an understanding of the context of those terms and the other words used in a query. I wrote about that patent in the post, Investigating Google RankBrain and Query Term Substitutions. I think reading the patent that post is about, and the one that this post is about can be helpful in understanding some of the ideas behind a process such as RankBrain. This patent does provide a lot of insights in explaining the importance of context and how helpful that can be to a system that may be attempting to extract data from a source and index that data in a way which makes it easier to locate. I liked this passage in particular: Interestingly, some words in the English language, and other languages pertain to many different areas of subject matter. Thus, one may think of the universe of communication as containing numerous domains of subject matter. For example, the various domains in FIG. 2 refer to centers of meaning or subject matter areas. These domains are represented as somewhat indistinct clouds, in that they may accumulate a vocabulary of communication elements about them that pertain to them or that relate to them. Nevertheless, some of those same communication elements may also have application elsewhere. For example, a horse to a rancher is an animal. A horse to a carpenter is an implement of work. A horse to a gymnast is an implement on which to perform certain exercises. Thus, the communication element that we call “horse” belongs to, or pertains to, multiple domains. A search engine that can identify the domains or contexts that a word might fit within may be able to better index such words; as described in this patent: In an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention, a search engine process is developed that provides a deterministic method for establishing context for the communication elements submitted in a query. Thus, it is possible for a search engine now to determine to which domain or domains a communication element is “attracted.” Since few things are absolute, domains may actually overlap or be very close such that they man share certain communication elements. That is, communication elements do not “belong” to any domain, they are attracted to or have an affinity for various domains, and may have differing degrees of affinity for differing domains. One may think of this affinity as perhaps a goodness of fit or a best alignment or quality alignment with the subject matter of a particular domain. Contextually Rewarding Search Results The patent tells us that a search engine that works well is one that provides a searcher with information in response to a query that is “comparatively close related”. Information that is exactly what has been sought. Then information that is close to what has been sought and is still useful. Then it tells us that what would be “contextually unrewarding” would be information that shares the word in a completely different and useless context related to the query Words might be related to a wide range of particular fields or subject matter domains. The patent describes how these might be used: Typically, a domain list of about 40 to 50 terms have been found to be effective. Some domain lists have been operated successfully in an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention with as few as 10 terms. Some domain lists may contain a few hundreds of individual terms. For example, some domains may justify about 300 terms. Although the method is deterministic, rather than statistical, it is helpful to have about 40 to 50 terms in the domain list in order to improve the efficiency of the calculations and determinations of the method. The domain lists have utility in quickly identifying the particular domain to which their members pertain. This results from the lack of commonality of the terms and the lack of ambiguity as to domains to which they may have utility. By the same token, a list as small as the domain lists are necessarily limited when considering the overall vocabulary of communication elements available in any language. Thus, the terms in domain lists do not necessarily arise with the frequency that is most useful for rapid searching. That is, a word that is unique to a particular subject matter domain, but infrequently used, may not arise in very many queries submitted to a search engine. A process for creating a vocabulary list of a substantial universe or a substantial portion of a universe of communication elements may be performed by identifying a body or corpus of information organized by topical entries. Thereafter, the text of each of those entries identified may be subjected to a counting process in which occurrences of terms from the domain list occur within each of the topical entries. Ultimately, a calculation of a macro context may be made for each of the topical entries. This calculation is based on the domain lists, and the domains represented thereby. This is where this patent enters into the world of the Semantic Web. The places where different subject matter domains may be identified for different words could be in knowledge bases or online encyclopedias. Such collections of what is referred to as public knowledge might be called a “corpus”. This kind of corpus of information could be used to create a context vector used to index different meanings of words. When a different meaning is found, it might then be counted from that information corpus The patent tells us that terms found in such a place could be “individual words, terms, expressions, phrases, and so forth.” The patent attempts to put this into context for us with this statement: One may think of a topical entry as a vocabulary term. That is, every topical entry is a vocabulary word, expression, place, person, etc. that will be added to the overall vocabulary. That is, for example, the universe may be divided into about 100 to 120 domains for convenient navigation. Likewise, the domain lists may themselves contain from about 10 to about 300 select terms each. By contrast, the topical entries that may be included in the build of a vocabulary list may include the number of terms one would find in a dictionary such as 300 to 800,000. Less may be used, and conceivably more. Nevertheless, unabridged dictionaries and encyclopedias typically have on this order of numbers of entries. Contexts as Vectors When RankBrain first came out, there was a post published that looked at some information that might make it a little more understandable; it included some information about Geoffrey Hinton’s Thought Vectors, and there’s more about those in this post from Jennifer Slegg: RankBrain: Everything We Know About Google’s AI Algorithm. There is a Google Open Source Blog post on Word Vectors which is closely related, titled Learning the meaning behind words, written by Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, and Quoc Le. Ilya Sutskever was a student of Geoffry Hinton. Tomas Mikolov worked on a number of papers about word vectors while with the Google Brain team, including Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space. The patent spends a fair amount of time describing what it considers context vectors to be; the different domains which a word might fall into, and number of occurrences or weights for those words within those domains. It’s worth drilling down into the patent and reading about how terms can be considered context vectors that a search engine might label them as. When a searcher enters a query into a search engine to be searched, the query may be classified within contexts, to help in selecting information in response to that query. Using a Browser Helper Object The patent describes how it might identify different domains that might be associated with specific terms. It tells us that this might be done: By compiling a list of domain-specific questions, it is possible to (1) specify differences between very similar domains with great precision, and (2) create a rapid way to prototype a domain that does not require many hours of an expert’s time, and can be expanded by relatively inexperienced people. The patent also describes the use of a BHO (Browser Helper Object) in this manner: Another slightly more complex implementation is something like a Browser Helper Object (BHO) that runs on the user’s machine and watches/categorizes all surfing activity. With this system, even non-participating sites can contribute to the picture of the user, and any clicking the user does to ad sites served by certified clicks will pick up a much more comprehensive picture. The patent provides more details on how this contextual vector based system might work, and how data might be extracted from web pages. It is highly recommended reading if you want to get a better sense of how a context-based system might be used to index the web and to make specific information on the Web easier to improve upon most conventional keyword-based search engines.

Butler says: 10/05/2016 at 3:35 am The article is very interesting. They are starting to think more effectively about the process of understanding. Note; however, that they do not (and cannot) define context precisely. I am able to do this. It will be in my next post on Constants, Variances, and Identities. Note also how Google is also trying to set the precedent for patenting knowledge. This route will lead further to its own demise. This is wrong ethically, morally, and legally as well.﻿ Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 7:44 am Hi Carey, Thank you. It’s interesting seeing what Google is trying to do with the processes they’ve come up with to drive search. Trying to account for contexts seems to make sense. We’ll see where Google tries to take this next. Adam says: 10/05/2016 at 8:57 am Great stuff Bill! Shows how far we have come from keyword stuffing as an effective method of ranking a page to this new level of sophistication! I am not sure which one I prefer? 😉 Derek says: 10/05/2016 at 10:20 am Thanks Bill, as always, for your vigilance and thorough patent analysis. I thought the BHO component and its role in disambiguation was one of the most interesting parts of the patent. It reflects how critical browser and email market share are to Google’s core search business, especially since that user data is proprietary and unavailable to competing search engines. It also justifies Google’s continued investment in other freeware like Sheets and Docs—anything that yields a logged-in user improves Google’s chances of returning a better result than Bing or DuckDuckGo. Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 11:18 am Hi Adam, If you write about a topic, and provide enough facts and details so that a search engine can get a good sense of what your page is about (because it understands the context of your page) , I think that is an improvement over keyword stuffing or string matching of query terms with document terms. It’s good seeing Google making these kind of steps. Also good seeing that they are learning context from places such as knowledgebases, which makes indexing the web more about knowledge graphs. Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 11:23 am Hi Derek, Thank you! The Browser Helper Object was interesting and definitely tied into presenting this approach as a data extraction tool approach. Learning from the context of a searcher’s query may be improved by understanding the search history, prior searches, and web page visits of searchers. A searcher’s use of things like Google+ can also provide helpful information about searchers to put the context of a search into better perspective as well. Robert says: 10/05/2016 at 11:51 pm The Browser Helper Object seems to be the logical continuation from using other factors such as search history or even click through rates. This would seem to be a kind of reverse engineering where Google would be able to now get a better idea of what you’re not doing? As in elements that aren’t drawing your interaction and as such determine that they aren’t a good match. An example of: sometimes knowing what doesn’t work is in itself knowledge of something. Bill Slawski says: 10/06/2016 at 8:39 am Hi Robert, I think the BHO described in the patent would give Google a better idea of what you are doing, rather than what you aren’t doing. Riya Sharma says: 10/26/2016 at 11:25 pm Interesting…. Good to know that Google is not just keep sitting at its legacy Thanks for sharing such a informative article…. fernanda says: 11/02/2016 at 11:51 am It´s Nice. Great stuff Bill! Shows how far we have come from keyword stuffing as an effective method of ranking a page to this new level of sophistication! Bill Slawski says: 11/03/2016 at 8:31 am Thanks, Fernanda. It does make searches smarter by better understanding the meanings of words based upon their context. Bill Slawski says: 11/03/2016 at 8:33 am Thank you Riya, I was happy when I found this patent and read through it, because it does describe an interesting approach from Google.

With the launch of the two devices, Google has given a break to its ‘Nexus’ lineup and has streamlined the naming scheme for all the devices. Although made by HTC, these smartphone are also the first ones to come without any OEM branding. Both feature aluminium and glass frames and come in Black, Silver and Blue (limited the US) colour variants. The Google Pixel starts at $649 for 32GB in-built storage, the Pixel XL costs $769 for 32GB and $869 for 128GB version. Also, both run Android 7.1 Nougat OS out of the box. Both smartphones will sport the company’s own ‘Google Assistant’ which is already present in the Allo messaging app. Users can touch and hold the home button to activate the Google Assistant. The duo also features the new Pixel launcher. Both will also include Google Duo video messaging app. The company says that the Pixel and the Pixel XL will also have their own set of Live Cases. The Pixel smartphones can be pre-ordered via Google’s website and will hit the shelves starting October 20 as per the company. The devices will be available in US, UK, Australia, Canada and Germany this month and will arrive in India in October 13. The more powerful of the two, Google Pixel XL, features a 5.5-inch QHD (1440×2560 pixels) resolution Amoled display with Gorilla Glass 4 and comes with the integrated Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensor on the back. The smartphone is powered by the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 with 4GB RAM and comes in three storage variants: 32GB and 128GB; external storage support option is also there.

MARKETING 5 Foolproof Ways to Improve Your SEO Driving traffic to your website is not as complicated as you think - but you need to have a strategy. By Molly Reynolds Molly Reynolds has a strong passion for helping creative innovators fine-tune their skills for selling their product and themselves. For more of her work, please visit The Unicorn in the Room. @Molly_Reynolds1 The Unicorn in the Room@Molly_Reynolds1 WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Fifteen years ago, most small business owners would never attempt an SEO strategy by themselves. It all seemed so complicated - plus there wasn't as much great information out there and not as many tools that helped the new guys improve their ranking. In fact, if you'll recall, these were the days before Adwords was invented and you'd have Google reps visiting your office asking you which keywords you needed to buy. You couldn't access your analytics in real time - you'd have to wait a month until the reps came back and told you how you did! Times have changed (thankfully) and entrepreneurs can take SEO matters into their own hands just by keeping up to date on algorithm changes, using the right tools, and being diligent. It's a common misconception that all you have to do to improve your SEO is post a lot of content and your traffic will increase. Not true, unfortunately. Remember, there is so much content on the internet and not all of it is created equal. If you're a do-it-yourself-SEOer, make sure you're doing these five things: 1. Get your site indexed It's quite possible that you're not ranking because your site has not been indexed with Google - so the bots don't even know your site exists! I learned this lesson the hard way when I was first starting out. If you don't know how to index your site, you can either go to Google's help page and follow the steps or go to a site like Upwork and pay a freelancer $25 to do it for you. 2. Take advantage of SEO plugins There are a lot of free or cheap resources available to help small businesses succeed in their online marketing and SEO is no exception. According to Tommy McDonald of SerpLogic, Wordpress is the best free do-it-yourself platform for building an SEO-friendly website. And if you find SEO plugins (such as Yoast SEO), they will help you stay on top of your site optimization. Platforms like this will help you understand what to do increase your SEO, but it's up to you to keep it up. So many people start off well and then their efforts drop off because they either forget or get lazy. To keep from falling into this trap, set a daily and weekly checklist for yourself. 3. Post good-looking, relevant content Look, posting a lot of content is great, but it has to actually matter. It's not enough to just get visitors to come to your site - you want them stay. AND come back! The way to do this is by posting thoughtful, relevant content that keeps them engaged with your site. Use videos, pictures, podcasts and make your content look visually appealing. The more enjoyable it is to read, the more likely your visitors will stick around. Neil Patel, author of Hustle, mentions that writing 3000+ word articles helps increase your long tail keyword count. This helps you get more links back to your content, which increases your search traffic. 4. Show authority As far as Google is concerned, this is the most important. You need to be getting links to your site from high traffic sites in order to prove your authority to the bots. There are a few ways to accomplish this. One option is subscribing to HARO (HelpaReporterOut.com) and responding to inquiries from journalists. If they use you as an expert source, they'll usually link to your website. Or, you could offer a testimonial on a high traffic website. You'd simply make a list of the products you use and reach out to those companies offering to give them a testimonial in exchange for them linking it to your website. 5. Fix broken links This one was news to me, but Chirag Kulkarni, co-founder of Taco, pointed out that broken links can actually get you penalized with Google. If you've been creating content long enough, chances are that you have some links on certain articles that no longer work. This means that articles about the same topics on other sites that don't have broken links are ranking higher than you. Remedy this by doing a monthly check of all your links to ensure everything's working properly. On a final note, don't get overwhelmed by SEO - instead, try seeing it as a game. It's actually kind of fun to go on your analytics page, see which days saw a spike in traffic, and figure out why. Constantly experiment with content and see what works - when you find what's working, amp it up! The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

Monday 14 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 06:40 / GMT - 03:10 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Sat Oct 08, 2016 1:49 How Google Home's 'Always on' Will Affect Privacy Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Google this week took the wraps off Google Home, its smart speaker and home entertainment hub, but questions remain about the impact the device will have on users' privacy. A direct rival to Amazon Echo, Google Home is the company's entry into the smart home market. Large shops will find many reasons for making the switch. Businesses of other sizes might have to do a Read Now Want Google Home to play your favorite song? Just say, "OK, Google" and ask for it to play the music. Want the device, which is equipped with its artificial-intelligence based Assistant, to play that funny cat video from YouTube on your TV? You get the picture. Google Home is always listening for the phrase, "OK, Google" so it can take its instructions. The issue that has some people concerned is the phrase "always listening." Since Google collects information about what users are searching for online, what phrases they're using in their email, what directions they want in Maps and where they are day to day, what more information could it be collecting about what users are doing in their own homes? Could the new data being collected be even more personal? "There are plenty of privacy issues with this type of always listening technology," said Dan Olds, an analyst with OrionX, a technology analyst firm. "It's obvious that any device that is always listening could also be always storing and always analyzing anything that is within earshot of the receiver." Olds added that Google Home could help Google amass a whole new range of information about people. "It could give Google a hell of a lot more personal data about users than they get now," he said. "That microphone will be a witness to every verbal interaction in the home. It will also know what you watch on TV, what you listen to, and, obviously, when there's no one home." Google, however, told Computerworld that user privacy was foremost in designers' minds when they developed the device. "All the devices that come with the Google Assistant are designed with privacy in mind," said a Google spokesperson in an email. "We only process speech after the hotword "OK Google" is detected. If the hotword is not heard, the audio snippet stays local on the device and is discarded." The spokesperson did not say how long the information stays stored locally. However, she did note that users can access the data that has been collected about them by going to their My Activity page and delete what they don't want collected about them. What will Google do with the data collects from its home device? According to the company spokesperson, the device will use its audio history to learn the sound of users' voices, how specific users pronounce words and phrases and further improve speech recognition. She did not say what would be done with the data collected from things like music preferences and search questions. "Google claims that the information is only captured when you are making a request, but with all of the security problems we've had with technology in this class, baby monitors in particular, you sure wouldn't want anything like this someplace where security was a big concern, like in a conference room or lab, for instance," said Rob Enderle, an analyst with The Enderle Group. "In most cases, the exposure is likely more on whether it can tell and report on whether you are home or not, but with the alleged Yahoo email scanning scandal, the level of concern is, and likely should remain, high." Of course, Google has noted that users can press a Mute button on the Home device so it isn't always listening, but that diminishes the usefulness of the device. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said users should always be on guard. "To be on the safe side, consumers should assume Home is always listening," he said. "Google also didn't specify whether or not information mined through Home would be used to build advertising profiles. Consumers who want a high degree of privacy should be worried and do the due diligence to read privacy agreements." For Olds, Home simply has a high creepy factor. "I think that people will be creeped out by these systems as they become more sophisticated," he said. "Imagine that you were having a casual conversation with friends about adding a hot tub to your back yard. The next day, as you go about your digital business, you might find your email inbox full of ads for hot tubs, and all of the banners on your internet searches festooned with even more ads for hot tub dealers. Is the convenience offered by these products worth the highly targeted advertising that will be the end result? We'll see." Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research, said he's sure that Google Home will collect more information about users than the company had before. He's just not all that worried about it. "The reason I live with Google's having so much of my information is that it makes the services more useful to me, and I'm sure enough that it won't be revealed to anyone or used for anything other than advertising and responsiveness," he said. "I'm not totally sure, but it's a gamble I'm willing to take." Enderle noted that society is reaching a time when everything people do likely will be captured by someone. "I don't think we are ready for that eventuality yet," he said. He also had a piece of advice for anyone worried about Google Home collecting too much data about them. "Don't buy it."         LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army in Battle with Terrorists in Southern Aleppo Before Winning Full Control over Region Iranian Shiites Begin Long Walk to Visit Imam Hossein's Shrine in Iraq's Karbala Syrian Army in Full Control of Dhahiyat al-Assad District in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus USA: Anti-Trump Protesters March in Portland for 5th Night in a Row Terrorists Experience Great Defeat in Southern Aleppo Millions March in 4th Day of Anti-Trump Protests Putting out the Candle of the Wicked: God Never Left Syria Iraqi Forces Deploy 3 KM From Eastern Bank of Tigris River Iraqi Army Enters Key District in Eastern Mosul Iraqi Volunteer Forces' Spokesman Announces Imminent Operations to Liberate Tal Afar Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus Portland Police Declare Curfew for Minors amid Anti-Trump Protests Battle for Mosul Day 27: Iraqi Forces Win Back Ancient City of Nimrud Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo TEHRAN (FNA)- After seizing control of Dhahiat al-Assad and Menyan in the weekend, the Syrian army and popular forces continued their advances against the terrorist groups in New Aleppo, Jamiat al-Mostaqbal, Menyan and al-Hamdaniyeh regions.

The effort is seen as an evolution in computing that allows users to interact with machines in natural conversation style, telling devices to tend to tasks such as ordering goods, checking traffic, making restaurant reservations or searching for information. The artificial intelligence (AI) component in these programs aims to make create a world in which everyone can have a virtual aide that gets to know them better with each interaction. Here are some of the offerings available: Google Google is making a high-profile push into AI, with the internet titan's chief referring to it as a force for change as powerful as powerful as smartphones. Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets -- aiming to outdo Apple's Siri -- enabling users to organize and use information on the devices and in the cloud -- to check emails, stay up to date on calendar appointments, news or ask for traffic and weather data. Google also offers AI through its Allo messaging application which can be installed on smartphones, and its Google Home hub, a standalone device similar to Amazon's Echo which responds to voice commands to manage tasks and fetch information where people live. Samsung The South Korean electronics giant moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri. Samsung says the acquisition announced this month is part of its effort o provide AI-based voice assistance services its customers can use across all Samsung devices and products, from smartphones to televisions to washing machines. Samsung is world's leading maker of smartphones powered by Google's free Android software, but also has its own Tizen mobile operating system, so how it may field its own virtual assistant technology remains to be seen. Amazon Amazon in 2014 unveiled its Echo home assistant, a voice-activated speaker, powered by its "Alexa" artificial intelligence program. Users can ask for news or information updates, as well as ordering goods from the online retail giant. Echo also serves as a connected-home hub which can control compatible appliances, lightbulbs and other devices. Since introducing Echo, Amazon has launched a smaller version called "Dot" and integrated Alexa into its Fire TV devices. Microsoft Microsoft's personal assistant uses the name Cortana and is available on Windows devices and its Xbox console and as an application on Apple iOS and Android devices. Unveiled in 2014, Cortana -- a name based on a character in its blockbuster game "Halo" -- responds to conversationally spoken requests or commands, using insights gleaned from calendars, contact lists, online searches and other smartphone sources to respond in a manner akin to a real-life aide. Facebook Facebook, heavily investing in artificial intelligence, is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename "M." The social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to create a real-life version of "Jarvis," the assistant in the assistant in the Marvel Comics series "Iron Man." For now, Facebook is enabling AI-powered "bots" on its Messenger mobile application that allows users to get answers to questions and engage in text exchanges as though chatting with the social network itself. Apple Apple was the first to offer its personal assistant, introducing Siri for the iPhone in 2011, and has been working to improve it over the years. Recently, Siri was upgraded to interact with non-Apple applications, so users can book a ride with Lyft or make payments using Square Cash. Apple has also introduced a Home application that can connect with smart appliances and other devices, and is reportedly working on a standalone speaker similar to Amazon Echo and Google Home. IBM Technology stalwart IBM made headlines nearly 20 years ago with "Deep Blue" software that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov at his own game, and more recently with "Watson" artificial intelligence that triumphed over top human players in a Jeopardy television game show. IBM has put Watson to work making business systems and services smarter with data and customers. Thousands of people are expected to attend a World of Watson conference later this month in Las Vegas.

Home News Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones Google is spending big money on Pixel marketing In an attempt to catapult its new Pixel smartphones, Google is splashing on big marketing campaigns By: Anthony Garreffa | Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones News | Posted: Oct 9, 2016 3:13 am Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Google really did make quite the impression when it announced its new Pixel smartphones, a first for the company in premium all-Google smartphones with some nice surprises like the near-perfect voice assistant in Google Assistant - oh, and Google claiming Pixel has the best smartphone camera ever.     Well, you're not going to push all of those points along with the fact that Pixel and Pixel XL ship with Android 7.1, with Google putting a massive load of optimizations and tweaks to the Android operating system. Because Google isn't a known manufacturer of hardware products, the company wants to make a splash. Rachel Pasqua from a New York-based advertising firm said: "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands".   Mario Queiroz, Vice President of Product Management for Google said that the company was about to start its major advertising power on Pixel, we didn't get an exact dollar amount. We were teased that Google would be buying ads during Thanksgiving football games, which we all know are very lucrative - thus, very expensive.   It's already working, as Pixel and Pixel XL are both sold out on the Google Store - days after their announcement.   Pixel pricing:   Pixel 32GB - $649 Pixel 128GB - $749 Pixel XL 32GB - $649 Pixel XL 128GB - $869 Recommended for You iPhone 7 could come out in a new - Jet White color Samsung Galaxy S8 will ship with an AI digital assistant...

The effort is seen as an evolution in computing that allows users to interact with machines in natural conversation style, telling devices to tend to tasks such as ordering goods, checking traffic, making restaurant reservations or searching for information. The artificial intelligence (AI) component in these programs aims to make create a world in which everyone can have a virtual aide that gets to know them better with each interaction. Here are some of the offerings available: Google Google is making a high-profile push into AI, with the internet titan's chief referring to it as a force for change as powerful as powerful as smartphones. Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets -- aiming to outdo Apple's Siri -- enabling users to organize and use information on the devices and in the cloud -- to check emails, stay up to date on calendar appointments, news or ask for traffic and weather data. Google also offers AI through its Allo messaging application which can be installed on smartphones, and its Google Home hub, a standalone device similar to Amazon's Echo which responds to voice commands to manage tasks and fetch information where people live. Samsung The South Korean electronics giant moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri. Samsung says the acquisition announced this month is part of its effort o provide AI-based voice assistance services its customers can use across all Samsung devices and products, from smartphones to televisions to washing machines. Samsung is world's leading maker of smartphones powered by Google's free Android software, but also has its own Tizen mobile operating system, so how it may field its own virtual assistant technology remains to be seen. Amazon Amazon in 2014 unveiled its Echo home assistant, a voice-activated speaker, powered by its "Alexa" artificial intelligence program. Users can ask for news or information updates, as well as ordering goods from the online retail giant. Echo also serves as a connected-home hub which can control compatible appliances, lightbulbs and other devices. Since introducing Echo, Amazon has launched a smaller version called "Dot" and integrated Alexa into its Fire TV devices. Microsoft Microsoft's personal assistant uses the name Cortana and is available on Windows devices and its Xbox console and as an application on Apple iOS and Android devices. Unveiled in 2014, Cortana -- a name based on a character in its blockbuster game "Halo" -- responds to conversationally spoken requests or commands, using insights gleaned from calendars, contact lists, online searches and other smartphone sources to respond in a manner akin to a real-life aide. Facebook Facebook, heavily investing in artificial intelligence, is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename "M." The social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to create a real-life version of "Jarvis," the assistant in the assistant in the Marvel Comics series "Iron Man." For now, Facebook is enabling AI-powered "bots" on its Messenger mobile application that allows users to get answers to questions and engage in text exchanges as though chatting with the social network itself. Apple Apple was the first to offer its personal assistant, introducing Siri for the iPhone in 2011, and has been working to improve it over the years. Recently, Siri was upgraded to interact with non-Apple applications, so users can book a ride with Lyft or make payments using Square Cash. Apple has also introduced a Home application that can connect with smart appliances and other devices, and is reportedly working on a standalone speaker similar to Amazon Echo and Google Home. IBM Technology stalwart IBM made headlines nearly 20 years ago with "Deep Blue" software that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov at his own game, and more recently with "Watson" artificial intelligence that triumphed over top human players in a Jeopardy television game show.

A judge ruled that other software engineers over age 40 who interviewed with the company but didn't get hired can step forward and join the lawsuit. The suit was brought by two job applicants, both over the age of 40, who interviewed but weren't offered jobs. Specifically, the judge has approved turning the suit into a "collective action" meaning that people who "interviewed in person with Google for a software engineer, site reliability engineer, or systems engineer position when they were 40 years old or older, and received notice on or after August 28, 2014, that they were refused employment, will have an opportunity to join in the collective action against Google," the ruling says.  While this isn't good news for Google, the ruling was strictly focused on whether the suit could be broadened to include more people. It doesn't meant that Google will ultimately lose the case. Google says it's fighting the suit. A spokesperson told us, "We believe the allegations here are without merit and we will continue to defend our position vigorously. We have strong policies against discrimination on any unlawful basis, including age." Interestingly, the judge is particularly not buying that "policies" defense from Google, writing in the ruling:  "Having such a policy does not necessarily shield a company from a discrimination suit, particularly in light of the evidence and allegations presented here ... today, most, if not all, companies are well versed in anti-discrimination and make great efforts to ensure their written policies comply with anti-discrimination law." In terms of allegations, one of the plaintiffs alleged that a Google recruiter told her she needed to puts the dates of her graduation on her resume so interviewers could determine her age. That same plaintiff argued that she had found seven others who say they had similar experiences at Google. She also presented evidence to the court that the median age of Google's workforce is 29 while the median age in the US for programmers is 42.8 years old. How old are Google employees? Google has about 61,000 employees and we asked Google if the company has publicly released statistics on its median age. Age is not included with the company's published diversity report, which discusses sex and race. Google didn't respond. View photos Google GreyglersMore (Father of the Internet and Google employee Vint Cerf is one example of the Google's "Greyglers" groupGoogle) However, we do know that Google has a diversity club on campus called "Greyglers" which is for Googler employees over 40. The company describes it as a group for "company elders" that helps the company with "promoting age diversity awareness." The company was sued way back in 2004 for age discrimination and, after winding through the appeals system, the case was ultimately settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Still, just allowing people who went on job interviews but didn't get a job to join a suit is a startling turn of events.  Some folks on Hacker News, a site where programmers discuss news items of interest to them, worry that instead of solving the tech industry's age discrimination problem, it will make it worse. One wrote:  "Fallout from this: Companies will go to great lengths to avoid contact with people who submit resumes that imply they are old. No phone screens, no responses. It's going to be wintertime for folks in their late 30s now."

Home News Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones Google's new Pixel smartphones already sold out Google sells out of its Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones after being announced just days ago By: Anthony Garreffa | Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones News | Posted: Oct 9, 2016 2:00 am Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Google has already sold out of its new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, with the larger 128GB models of both handsets selling out quickly, followed by the 32GB version.     The Google Store ran out of the 128GB models first, most likely because there's no 64GB option - so people like myself will jump to the larger version, as we have a lack of expandable storage. Google is selling its first premium smartphones in two sizes: 5-inch and 5.5-inch with the Pixel, and Pixel XL respectively.   Pixel pricing:   Pixel 32GB - $649 Pixel 128GB - $749 Pixel XL 32GB - $649 Pixel XL 128GB - $869   I've personally ordered the smaller Pixel smartphone, but in the larger storage model - and even then, 128GB is something I'll never use thanks to heavy reliance on the cloud. I use Google services everyday like Gmail, Chrome, Drive, Photos and more - so photo storage gets thrown up to the cloud when my phone store begins to get filled. Not only that, but I also stream a lot of music everyday while I work, and it's not like 20-30 albums takes up much space - the rest? I'll stream when I want it on-tap.   Did you order a Pixel? Which size did you go with? If not, will you buy one? Or are you a hater? Let us know in the comments below.

The update, which bumps the app to version 4.23.0 includes enhancements to reviews and location descriptions, as well as iOS 10 optimizations and widget support. First off, the update adds the ability to upload photos alongside any reviews you write for Maps. This will be very beneficial when it comes to researching for a place, as you should now see images associated Maps locations more often. Additionally, today’s update also adds more detailed descriptions of places. Google has always worked to provide detailed information about places, but with this update, you can see more detailed information about a location’s features, its atmosphere, and its amenities. Most notably for iOS 10 users, however, is a set of redesigned widgets for “Nearby Transit” and “Travel Times.” The former shows the nearest transit options that are available, while the latter shows the estimated drive time to your home and work locations. With iOS 10, Apple revamped how widgets are handled and displayed and Google Maps now takes advantage of those changes. The full changelog is below: Upload photos along with your reviews of places See descriptions of places including features, atmosphere, and amenities iOS 10 support, including redesigned widgets for “Nearby Transit” and “Travel Times” Bug fixes The latest version of Google Maps for iOS is available on the App Store for free.

A shoplifter was caught and then prosecuted for stealing £60 ($104) of washing-up goods after she was photographed fleeing a store on Google Street View. Tammy McIvor, from Middlesbrough, can be seen running from discount store Savers in the town with a member of staff chasing her. Images of the robbery were stumbled across by an IT worker who saw McIvor sprinting out of the North Yorkshire shop while looking through the town online on the app. She was pictured by the camera which had been taking shots in the street, exiting from the store with her stolen goods in a Sports Direct carrier bag. Store bosses were able to identify the 30-year-old from the Google Street View stills. Although, as per Google policy, her face was blurred they were able to identify her from her distinctive white top she was wearing. She wore the same outfit when she was arrested. 'I'm an ex-Teesside University student so I thought I would see my old stomping ground, and as soon as I spotted it I thought 'that seemed a bit strange,' said Peter Darby, an IT worker who came across the images. 'I moved further down the street and you could see a bloke pursuing her. By the end she was going full speed. Continued below.

'She was running around with the Sports Direct bag and it was obvious she was up to no good.' The images were filmed on June 19 in the town center at around 2.45pm. She pleaded guilty to theft at Teeside magistrates court last week and was given a year-long community order, which has a drug rehabilitation requirement. The court heard McIvor has a long history of offending and drug abuse including a stint in prison in 2013 for burgling two properties in one night. The women, who has been a heroin addict since 16, also took drugs in prison and used someone else's name to get out of trouble. After the case, a friend of McIvor, said: 'She's harmless but she gets into trouble for shoplifting quite a bit. 'A lot of the shops in Middlesbrough and Stockton already know her and look out for her, but she's never been caught like this before.

The search giant unveiled several products at its recent event in San Francisco, California, two of which are new smartphones — the Pixel and Pixel XL. Related: Pixel phones, Daydream, Home — oh my! Everything Google revealed at its Oct. 4 event Google has “no plans” to produce another smartphone from its Nexus line, and that’s because the Pixel line marks the first time the device is completely “made by Google.” The smartphones feature tight hardware and software integration. If you have a Nexus 6P, you may be considering an upgrade to the Pixel XL. Below is our breakdown and analysis of the two Google heavyweight phablets, which can help you decide if you should cough up the dough to join Google’s new Pixel lineup. Performance Nexus 6P Google Pixel XL Size 6.27 × 3.06 × 0.29 inches (159.3 x 77.8 x 7.3mm) 6.0 x 2.9 x 0.2-0.34 inches (154.7 x 75.7 x 7.3-8.5mm) Weight 178 grams (6.28 ounces) 168 grams (5.93 ounces) Screen 5.7-inch AMOLED 5.5-inch AMOLED Resolution 1,440 × 2,560 pixels (515 ppi) 1,440 x 2,560 pixels (534 ppi) OS Android 7.0 Nougat (will receive Android 7.1 Nougat) Android 7.1 Nougat Storage 32GB, 64GB, 128GB 32, 128GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 RAM 3GB 4GB Connectivity GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE Camera 12MP rear, 8MP front 12MP rear, 8MP front Video 4K 4K Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer Accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer Water resistant No No Battery 3,450mAh 3,450mAh Ports USB-C, headphone jack USB-C, headphone jack Marketplace Google Play Google Play Color offerings Silver, black, white, gold Very Silver, Quite Black, Really Blue Availability Google Store unlocked Google Store unlocked, Verizon Price Starts at $500 Starts at $770 DT review Nexus 6P review Coming soon Yearly upgrades often don’t produce great differences in terms of hardware performance, and that’s reflective in the internals of the Pixel XL. It shares almost the same specs as last year’s Nexus 6P, except for a few improvements. The Pixel XL is a little smaller than the Nexus 6P, thanks to its 5.5-inch display. This means it’s a little lighter as well. The Nexus 6P has 3GB of RAM, but the Pixel XL adds an extra gigabyte. Both devices have 32 and 128GB storage options, but there is no 64GB model for the Pixel XL. Related: Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Hands on with Google’s latest and Android 7.1 The Pixel XL features the latest processor from Qualcomm — the Snapdragon 821. In fact, it’s the first device in the U.S. to feature the processor, which is said to improve performance by 10 percent  over the Snapdragon 820. But the Nexus 6P is powered by the Snapdragon 810, an outdated processor by 2016’s standards. That’s not to say the Snapdragon 810 in the Nexus 6P doesn’t perform well. You won’t have any issues, but note that the Pixel XL features tight hardware and software integration. It’s unlike the Nexus line, where the software was designed by Google and the hardware was made by a third-party manufacturer. HTC is the manufacturer for the Pixel XL, with Google choosing the components to work with its operating system — similar to how Apple works with Foxconn to build the iPhone. You’re undoubtedly going to notice that Android performs better on the Pixel XL than on the Nexus 6P, thanks to these software and hardware integrations. Winner: Pixel XL Design, display, and durability Here’s the more subjective comparison. Personal preference applies to which smartphone looks the best, but we can say the Pixel XL felt a lot more comfortable to hold than the Nexus 6P. Its edges are more rounded and smooth. We like the “G” branding more than the large “Nexus” branding on the back of the device, and the half-glass back is certainly unique. The Nexus 6P offers stereo front-facing speakers, but the Pixel only has a speaker at the bottom edge. It also seems like the Nexus 6P may have slightly smaller bezels, but the difference is hardly noticeable. The 6P and the Pixel XL feature an AMOLED display with the same Quad HD resolution — 2,560 x 1,440 pixels. The 6P has a slightly larger display at 5.7 inches, as opposed to the 5.5-inch screen on the Pixel XL. You won’t notice much of a difference here, but we’ll have wait until we can review the Pixel XL for final judgment. Related: What smart home devices will work with Google Home when it debuts November 4? Both devices should have similar durability ratings thanks to the use of Gorilla Glass 4 — be aware  that there’s potentially more glass to crack on the back of the Pixel than on the 6P if you drop it. And they’re not water resistant, so don’t expect to take them swimming. In addition silver and black variants, the Nexus 6P comes in two more colors — gold and white. The Pixel has a black and silver option, but it also offers a unique “really blue” variant. It’s not often you see a blue phone, so a point goes to the Pixel. It’s a tough call, but we think the Pixel’s glass back looks better than the glass visor on the 6P. Winner: Pixel XL Battery Both smartphones have the exact same battery size, but Google claims the Pixel XL has longer battery life thanks to better control over hardware and software. The Nexus 6P has a standby time up to around 18 days, whereas the Pixel XL can go on standby for 23 days. Read More Internet use time for the Nexus 6P is around 10 hours on Wi-Fi, and 10 hours on LTE. For the Pixel XL, you can add 4 more hours on both Wi-Fi and LTE. Winner: Pixel XL Camera One highlight Google is pushing for the Pixel smartphones is the camera — it has received the highest score on DXOMark for a smartphone camera. The experience was built from the ground up, with a proprietary gyro-based stabilization software for video, improved HDR+ that processes incredibly fast, and one of the fastest capture times Google has clocked in its various tests. We tested the camera at the San Francisco event and it snapped pictures in succession at much faster speeds than the 6P. The Pixel also had a faster HDR+ processing speed. Google is also offering several Pro features in the camera, such as white balance presets, exposure compensation, automatic exposure and automatic focus locking, and viewfinder grid modes. Related: Google Pixel vs. Apple iPhone 7: Can new Google phone take down its enemy? Pixel owners also get free unlimited photo storage in Google Photos at full resolution. This is already an option in Google Photos, but storing at full resolution will eat up Google account storage space for non-Pixel owners. Both phones have the same megapixel count on both the front and rear cameras, but megapixels aren’t as much of a factor as software optimization. If anything, the unlimited, full resolution photo storage feature alone makes it a no-brainer to opt for the Pixel camera, rather than the Nexus 6P’s camera. Winner: Pixel XL Software The Pixel smartphones come equipped with the latest version of Android: 7.1 Nougat. The Nexus 6P is running Android 7.0 Nougat and will receive the beta version of 7.1 in November, when the Pixels launch. But that doesn’t mean the Nexus 6P is going to have the same software as the Pixel. There are several Pixel-exclusive features, notably Google Assistant. Press and hold the home button, and you’ll find Google Assistant come up, asking what you need help with. The Assistant can run search queries, order an Uber, and more. The feature may end up on Nexus phones as Google is “exploring” ways to implement it, but it’s unlikely it will come any time soon. Smart Storage, which automatically removes backed up photos from your device, and the Pixel Launcher are only on the Pixel. You also get 24/7 support built into the phone, complete with screen sharing in case you ever run into an issue. Related: What you need to know about Google’s Pixel software, and what’s in Android 7.1 Nougat Notably, there are a few features coming to other Android phones in 7.1: Night Light, a night mode; Launcher Shortcuts, similar to iOS’ 3D Touch; improved touch latency; fingerprint gestures that allow you to swipe down to bring down the notification drawer and more; Daydream VR support, and other seamless updates. You can read more about the differences between Android 7.1 Nougat in the Pixel and other Android devices here, but it’s always going to be a surefire win for the Pixel line. Winner: Pixel XL Pricing and availability Google is aiming for the big guns with its Pixel line — Samsung and Apple. Its devices are priced accordingly as well. The base 32GB Pixel XL costs $769 and the 128GB model costs $869. At the time of launch, the Nexus 6P was $500 for the 32GB model — markedly cheaper. Still, Google offers device financing from the Google Store, where you can pay off the phone in monthly payments over the course of 24 months. This was not available for the Nexus 6P, which is no longer for sale on the Google Store. You can pre-order the Pixel XL from the Google Store unlocked, and Verizon and Best Buy are selling the device as well.  The Nexus 6P is still available from third-party retailers like Amazon. Winner: Nexus 6P Overall winner: Pixel XL Sure, the Pixel XL’s price is quite a jump from the Nexus 6P, but strong software and hardware integration alone may be enough to warrant it. You’re getting the very best of Android, fast updates, 24/7 support, a much improved camera and internal specs, as well as unlimited, full resolution photo storage from Google Photos. You’re also getting a better battery life, though we’ll have to test Google’s claim once we get a review unit. Related: Friends? Not anymore. Google wants you to bow down and meet your master You should buy the Pixel XL if you’re deciding between the two, but if you’re thinking about upgrading, that’s a different question. You won’t see a huge increase in performance (except for the camera, maybe), but it depends if you want access to Assistant. You can still use Assistant via Google Allo, a messaging app, or by purchasing a Google Home. There is speculation that Google is looking to manufacture its own chips for its future products so that it won’t have to rely on HTC or other manufacturers. If that’s true, we may see even tighter software and hardware integration, and something truly special for Android in the next year or so. You can always hold out until then, but don’t expect the price to drop. Google’s aiming for the high-end market for sure, as Rick Osterloh, head of the hardware department at Google, says as in his interview with Recode.

It appears that Google is actively removing the feature — I’m currently no longer seeing it on my Galaxy S7 edge — from the latest versions of the Google app… Holding down a combination (it varies by manufacturer) of the home, volume, and power buttons on most Android phones will capture a screenshot, but if you weren’t aware, Now on Tap added the ability to capture screenshots as well at some point last year. Holding the home button for Now on Tap and jumping straight to a share sheet was — in experience — the best part of the feature. But now it’s gone for many, I’m sad to report. I had it on an older version of the Google app on my Galaxy S7 edge, and it disappeared after I updated. Frankly, I don’t use Now on Tap very often, and I’m pretty glad that Google wisely decided to put the Assistant in its place on the Pixel phones (yes, I’m aware that the Now on Tap features are still there). But for those of us that are annoyingly without Assistant for a while (*cough* Nexus 6P users * cough*), it’s pretty odd that Google would remove this functionality.

Google announced one of the biggest typography projects, Noto, on Thursday. The font family covers more than 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. By Zhai Yun Tan, Staff October 8, 2016 Save for later Saved About video ads Google launches Noto, a family of fonts that covers over 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. View Caption About video ads View Caption of When your computer doesn’t recognize a language, a blank box is displayed on the screen – commonly known as a tofu. Seeing a tofu constantly is frustrating for those who find that they cannot share texts in their original scripts. Ali Eteraz, a Pakistani-American writer, wrote in a Medium post in 2013 about how nastaliq, a script from Urdu, which is a language spoken in Pakistan and India, is not supported in digital devices, so Urdu speakers must resort to pasting images of words to share texts, using other scripts, or simply writing with Western letters. “Constantly uploading image files to communicate maybe romantic (or it can make you feel like a second class digital citizen), but it is not practical,” he wrote. Recommended: Five times Internet activism made a difference On Thursday, Google announced their solution for the problem: Noto, named literally for “no more tofu,” a font family that covers more than 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. The project, five years in the making, is one of the biggest typography projects in recent times. It will be open source and free for download. Five times Internet activism made a difference Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend “Our goal for Noto has been to create fonts for our devices, but we’re also very interested in keeping information alive,” Bob Jung, director of internationalization for Google said in a press release. “When it comes to some of these lesser used languages, or even the purely academic or dead languages, we think it’s really important to preserve them. Without the digital capability of Noto, it’s much more difficult to preserve that cultural resource.” Noto, a product of collaboration between Google and font company Monotype, aims to “enable global communications across borders, languages, cultures and time periods,” as stated in the press release. While some may be wary of Google’s motives – the project arguably plays right into the giant company’s ambitions for global expansion – the goal is fitting to a time when more people than ever are using the Internet. For global minorities to be welcomed to the Internet with a familiar language can be vital in encouraging accessibility. “I’m hugely excited about this because Noto is massive and it’s really an amazing public service,” Finn Bunton, assistant professor at New York University, tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview. “Companies have incentives for doing this, but this is a pretty amazing thing to be done by Google.” Professor Bunton says Noto is monumental because until now, text has been transmitted and displayed in screens only through limited codes, which means some fonts don't even offer accented characters. Since the 1990s, the Unicode Consortium, a nonprofit that sets standard code points for symbols, characters, and even emojis on the Internet, has worked to create unique identifiers for every glyph in written languages. “But that didn’t mean you would be able to translate that into something that you could rely on to look good, be readable and work appropriately across a huge variety of platforms,” Bunton explains. “This is what Noto has done which is so amazing.… They’ve made a consistent library where all the pieces are going to be visually harmonious and easy to read.” Figuring out the unique codes for different languages can be tough. As reported by NPR in 2014, Unicode ran into trouble when they  clumped Chinese, Japanese and Korean into one character set. “You’d get this mishmash of fonts,” Jung told WIRED in an interview. “That was always the complaint we got – fonts just don’t look good when you mix languages.” Monotype and Google worked with reviewers who are native readers of the language or experts in typography to refine the product, including a Buddhist monastery who critiqued the font and made adjustments for the Tibetan script. For some languages, this may be the first time the script has a digital presence, let alone a dedicated display font. "That in particular is something that many different language communities could not afford to do on their own,” Monotype linguistic typographer Kamal Mansour said in the press release. “Google has been the benefactor in funding this work, and in many cases, we’ve produced the first font ever to serve a particular language community. So to me, the aim is to serve that human community that would otherwise be deprived of the ability to have a digital heritage.” Next up Five times Internet activism made a difference How Saul Bass changed design Verbal energy: Going geeky over type fonts Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads Monitor's Best: Top 5 How Americans are handling post-election hate GOP-controlled Congress will still need Democrats Cover Story Why climate change divides us The president is commander in chief?

Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet's Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications, which has a US exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's October 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleve, a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it's OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

The creation of interactions will be done through the recently announced Actions on Google.  Google Assistant is an AI offering much like Amazon's Alexa. This makes Actions on Google the platform's version of Amazon's Skills.  Upon the opening of the Actions on Google program, developers will have access to Assistant's SDK. Developers will be able to create two types of requests: direct actions and conversational actions. Direct actions are suited for transactional requests such as home automation or requesting of media. Conversations on the other hand, are for tasks that require more of a back and forth interaction. Requesting an Uber, providing your destination and specifying which type of car you need would be an example. These interactions are powered by API.ai which Google acquired last month. Google Assistant is already featured in the Allo chat app and Google Home. With the opening of the platform developers will be able to integrate it into their own services and devices. Bots already built with API.ai will also be available to integrate into Assistant. It's worth noting however, that Assistant is currently only available for Pixel phones. A Google spokesperson confirmed this to TechCrunch stating, "Our goal is to make the Google Assistant widely available to users, and we’ll continue to launch new surfaces over the course of the next year." Google has already lined up a number of parnters for the Actions on Google launch. These include Spotify and CNN for media, Uber for ride sharing, OpenTable for restaurant reservations and more. Interested developers can sign up for news and updates. About the author: Wendell Santos is the editor at ProgrammableWeb.com. You can reach him at wendell@programmableweb.com.

Tesla is opening a 65,000 square foot store, its largest retail center to date. The facility will offer sales and service of Tesla's electric car line. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Photo : Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Interbrand just released this year's Top 100 global brands, and Apple, Google, and Coca-Cola take this year's Top 3 spots again.  Newbies who entered the Top 100 are Tesla and fashion empire Dior. This list is based on consumer influence and brand presence. Advertisement Apple and Google have consistently been the top two global brands for the past four years, and they are still growing. Both companies respectively have seen a 5% and 11% percent growth respectively in the past year. The brand consultancy agency has been curating this list for the past 17 years, and CEO Jez Frampton says that based on the topnotchers on the list, it can be told that "the best global brands are not just weathering change, but driving it, They understand their Anatomy of Growth is complex, unique and personal; they look inward and outward, expand into new markets, and create better experiences to grow their brands and businesses." Tesla is a welcome addition in the respected list of the Top 100 global brands. They have proven that it's possible to grow into a super company from scratch. Especially in the auto industry, that's pretty much an impossible feat. With Elon Musk's lead, Tesla is now one of the leading brands in its sector. There are qualifications for companies to take a coveted spot on the list. According to their official website, a company must be operating in three major continents and they must have a roadmap in emerging markets. Thirty percent of the revenue must come from other countries, and fifty percent of it shouldn't come from just one continent. The Interbrand way of determining who makes the list is ISO certified as well. The qualifications are pretty strict, which makes being part of the list an even bigger privilege. Will Apple and Google still reign supreme on next year's list? With many industries going up and down, it's anybody's guess who'll be the next game changers.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google will open NY pop-up store for Pixel phone & other hardware Adam Westlake - Oct 8, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Now that Google has announced a pair of new smartphones and other additional hardware, it’s opening a similarly branded “Made by Google” physical retail location. The company has revealed it will open a pop-up store on 96 Spring Street in Manhattan, New York on October 20th, offering customers the chance to check out the hardware announced earlier this week, including the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, the Google Home smart speaker, and the Google WiFi. The store listing was found on the new Made by Google website. Since it’s a ‘pop-up,’ it’s likely the location won’t be a permanent retail fixture, however there’s no details on how long it will remain open or if it will move to other cities. As the web and software giant is making a serious move into the hardware market, it makes sense for Google to have a physical retail presence. It’s a move that has been used to great success by Apple, which now has hundreds of permanent stores, and even more recently by Amazon, which has plans to open pop-ups in shopping malls to highlight its Echo and Kindle devices. This isn’t Google’s first experiment with retail stores, however. When the company was trying to launch its ill-fated Google Glass as the next big, trend-setting wearable device, it opened a handful of physical showrooms in cities like San Francisco, London, New York City, and Los Angeles.

According to recently released data, the top 5 of the destinations searched on Google is: Reykjavik - As Iceland is the ideal destination for adventure travel and Northern Lights spotting, trips to Reykjavik were preferred by women in their 20s and 30s. Havana - With the renewed diplomatic relationships between USA and Cuba this year and the first Florida-Havana commercial flight launched in August, people began to show their interest in the Caribbean island nation. According to Google report, men in their 30s and 40s were the ones searching for this destination. Toronto – Easy to access from eastern USA, Toronto was preferred by hockey fans and Americans living in Michigan. Canada's biggest city, Toronto is the capital of the province of Ontario located along Lake Ontario’s northwestern shore. Famous for its skyscrapers as well as for its wide green spaces, Toronto offers vibrant tourist attractions, appealing for the most selective of travelers. Mexico City - Mexico's capital is currently drawing enthusiastic travelers because of its powerful history, unique architecture and delicious cuisine. One of the largest cities in the world, Mexico City abounds in museums, archaeological sites and historical buildings. Food diversity can also be overwhelming. If willing to discover the true spirit of a Mexican fiesta, than this is the perfect place for you! Tokyo – Since the country has just raised its tourism goals for the next 4 years, the tech-friendly Tokyo will probably not be the only destination in Japan that will appeal to travelers. For now, Google's data indicated that people searching for this destination are predominantly men, aged between 24-35.

Tech giants are hungry for artificial intelligence. In a race to create the best AI solutions in an increasingly hot sector, U.S. tech behemoths like Alphabet's Google and iPhone maker Apple have been quietly snapping up dozens of artificial intelligence companies over the last five years, according to a recent report from analysis firm CB Insights. The firm's data sheds new light on a trend that's been evolving for years. Nearly 140 private companies working to advance AI technology have been acquired since 2011, including 40 buyouts just this year, CB noted. From Google's Assistant to Apple's Siri; Microsoft's Cortana to Facebook chatbots, tech companies appear to be locked in a fierce competition to create autonomous technology that can understand users' needs, and provide information quickly and reliably, CB Insights noted. In addition, companies like AOL, IBM and Yahoo were also among the acquirers, CB said. The report comes as Silicon Valley makes increasingly aggressive inroads into AI, and last week, Microsoft created an artificial intelligence unit of its own. It's a hot market that research firm Tractica estimates will balloon from $643.7 million in 2016 revenues to $38.8 billion by 2025. show chapters <p>Samsung buys AI firm to take on Apple and Google</p> <p>The purchase will help the tech firm compete with Siri and Alexa in the world of artificial intelligence.</p> Samsung buys AI firm to take on Apple and Google    Thursday, 6 Oct 2016 | 9:00 AM ET | 04:50 Google has been the most prominent global player, CB noted, with 11 low-key acquisitions in the category. Most recently, the tech giant picked up Api.ai, a platfom used to develop chatbots. Earlier this year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company objective was to give each individual user their own Google. And last week, Google unveiled a high-end smartphone, Pixel, and home device installed with its AI software. Google said it believes that the next opportunity is building hardware and software together for better AI. The strategic move pitted the company against Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Corporate giants following closely in purchasing AI companies include Intel and Apple. Apple, which is usually quite about its acquisitions and planning, acquired Turi and Tuplejump recently, according to CB Insights. Earlier this year, Apple acquired an start-up called Emotient which has developed technology that can detect emotions. Not to be outdone, Samsung snapped up startup Viv Labs, amid a growing controversy over reports that its premium Galaxy Note 7 battery was exploding.

Google’s new “Pixel” smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming introduction and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc.Direct competition Google’s introduction of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc’s Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a “very significant marketing campaign”. He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who spoke on anonymity. Verizon investment Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone’s October 20 introduction through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel.Creative ads But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple’s ads, he said noting the white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone.

You probably haven't heard a whole lot about the location-based photo service in the past few years, and that's because this is actually the second time that Google's tried to close down the platform, after ultimately relenting following a user petition in 2014. Now, this time the company really means it and no amount of protest is going to stop the service closing. That means you'll need to make sure your account is linked to your Google+ account if you the photos you've uploaded over the years copued across to a Google archive for downloading. "If you have linked your Panoramio profile with a Google account, all your Panoramio photos will be copied to the Google Album Archive at full resolution after Panoramio goes away. These copied photos will not use any of your Google storage quota. Your Panoramio photos that appear in Google Maps will continue to appear in Maps, unless you delete them later from the Maps Contributions panel," Google advises users. From Google's perspective, it makes a lot of sense as it has newer features attached to Google Maps that do a similar, if not the same, job. Specifically, the Local Guides option, which lets people upload photos, reviews and other information about a location. From the perspective of long-time users that spent years contributing to Panoramio, uploading images, levelling up their accounts and generally building a community, it feels more like a metaphorical kick in the teeth. While there's a substitute in the form of Local Guides, and Panoramio had a good run since its launch in 2005, it's unlikely that the platform's holdouts will make the jump to Google Maps due to a slightly different feature set and less of a community focus.

Pocket-lint Sections App Camera Car Drone Fitness Tracker Gadgets Games Headphone Laptop Parenting Phone Smart Home Smartwatch Speaker Tablet TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards Polar M600 review: Top-notch smartwatch and fitness tracker fusion Chris Hall8 October 2016Smartwatch Pocket-lint 4.5 stars - Pocket-lint recommended £269 For Solid design, sports takes priority over smartwatch, all of Android Wear's functions, Polar Flow does so much, respectable battery performance for a smartwatch, IPX8 waterproofing Against Design could be more exciting, swimming could be better served, heart rate can be a little erratic, price Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment The explosion of smartwatches and fitness trackers has thrown up some real gems and thrown down some real turds, leaving us all to step carefully when choosing a new device. Polar is an established name in fitness devices, one of the oldest, perhaps, when dealing with heart rate monitoring. A widening portfolio from Polar has seen the birth of more lifestyle devices in the A family and stepping up in functions across the M (sport) and V (pro) devices, with a gradual increase in wider connectivity across the brand's offerings. The M600 is a rethinking, adopting a proper smartwatch platform and offering those fitness tracker functions the company is known for combined with a lot more on the watch side than you'd normally get. The result is one of the most considered sports devices we've seen and certainly one of the best Android Wear devices to date. Pocket-lint Polar M600 review: Design and build The Polar M600 mates the body module with a rubber strap and, like the TomTom Spark, the body slots into the strap meaning the two sections can be easily separated when you want to clean them. The design looks a lot like previous Polar watches, although it's pretty thick, meaning you need enough wrist for it to sit on. If you're of the thin forearm variety you might think it's too big, but we found it sat well on an average male arm. The chunkiness gives it some substance and it looks good, both from a sports point of view and as a smartwatch. Compared to other Android Wear devices, Polar's watch-making experience is apparent, as this is much nicer than something like the Moto 360 Sport and looks better and wears better than that previous attempt. As with other Polar devices the screen is square fitting Polar's family design. Pocket-lint On to the more serious stuff. There's proper waterproofing with an IPX8 rating so it supports swimming, the screen is protected with Gorilla Glass to avoid scratches and the metal detailing that frames the display left and right gives a premium look. There's the choice of black or white, although we'd like to see a choice of strap colours to give the design wider appeal. The rubber strap is easy to adjust and uses a conventional two pronged buckle, with two bands to stop the spare strap catching on things. Most importantly, the M600 is comfortable to wear and sweat through, and weighing 65g, it's not too heavy either. Polar M600 review: Sports features first Designed as a sports watch first, there are two buttons. The first button to the left side is the standard Android Wear button, letting you go home, wake the display or long press to access the menu. The second button on the front takes you straight to the sports side, opening the Polar app. This is very much sports territory and we really like that Polar hasn't been distracted by Android Wear: it's taken the platform and owned it, rather than skipping around Google's fancy smartwatch features. Pocket-lint The hardware tells a similar story. With an optical heart rate sensor onboard and its own GPS you're ready to run out the door and leave your smartphone at home. There is no compass or barometer, however, so direction and elevation is based on GPS. There's also support for accessories, so if you have an H7 Polar chest strap, you'll get the option of using that, which might be the preferred option for cyclists. One of the skills that Polar does adopt from Android Wear is the support for Bluetooth headphones and local storage for your music, meaning you can take your music with you on the run, again without your phone. TomTom Spark 3 offers this, as does Apple Watch 2, and it's a feature that is sure to be popular. The great thing is that this full feature set, supported by this hardware, makes for a great fitness device, before you even touch the smartwatch side of things.  Polar M600 review: Hardware specs and display The Polar M600 is powered by a MediaTek chipset with 512MB RAM and a standard 4GB of storage. The battery is 500mAh which is pretty good for this type of device and explains the thickness. Pocket-lint There's a 1.3-inch display on the front with a 240 x 240 pixel resolution. This isn't the largest or sharpest Android Wear watch display, but as we said, the screen fits and we found it a good size for reading on the move. It supports always on functions, dimming in normal wear and brightening up when you move the watch to look at. As an LCD this is a backlit full colour display so it's illuminated, rather than using the lower power displays that some other sports watches offer. It looks great, which adds to the appeal, but does draw more heavily on the battery than the mono TomTom or Garmin displays, for example. It does have an ambient light sensor, however, so adjusts to the lighting conditions around you. Polar M600 review: Battery life and charging The 500mAh battery will give you about 2 days of use when connected to an Android device, including exercise time. You might be able to push it to a little more in casual wear. We've not tested the Polar M600 with an iPhone, but reports suggest this drops to about a day with Apple's phone. In reality, the Android Wear experience is much enhanced when paired with an Android phone and at least you have the option, unlike the Apple Watch. Pocket-lint Two days is good for Android Wear devices, but it does mean regular charging compared to many other sports watches which will often give you perhaps 5 active days or more - but without really offering any smart functions. That's the trade-off here: the Polar M600 doesn't have great endurance in sporting terms, but it offers a whole lot more in terms of functionality, meaning it does a lot more than just tell you the time when you're walking around.  Charging is via the magnetic connection point on the rear and over the past weeks that we've been using the M600, we've typically opted to charge every other day without it running flat. The charger neatly attaches to the rear of the watch without needing to clip anything on or fiddle around. Polar M600 review: Setup and connections To get the M600 up and running you need two things: the Android Wear app and the Polar Flow app on your phone. The first handles the connection to your phone, the second syncs with your Polar account and syncs the data from your watch. Using Android Wear on an Android smartphone makes for a fast and easy connection as the devices are designed for seamless cooperation. Once you're connected, you can use the Android Wear app to control many of the smartwatch functions, like deciding what notifications you want from your M600 and so on. Pocket-lint The Android Wear app will also then sync your apps, so anything you have on your device that's compatible with Wear will then move over - like Spotify, Play Music, Citymapper and even other fitness apps if you want to use them.  The Polar Flow app then handles everything else. This is where you'll view your stats and be able to get a good look at your activities you record using the M600. We like the Polar Flow app. It's very much a lifestyle app on your phone, firstly delivering a report on your daily activities, but it lets you dive into your runs, check out your heart rate and pace from an activity as well as your route and other essential details.  Taking things further, the Polar Flow app has a calendar in it too where you can schedule workouts, meaning you can tap the watch and dive into the workout that you've planned. If you're training against a plan, it means you've got the information on your wrist, ready to get going. You can setup intervals, distance or time targets. You can also sync Polar training results and targets into your Google Calendar if you want and share the data with a couple of other services - Strava and Training Peaks. Pocket-lint Information is synced from the app to the web version of Polar Flow which includes a few more options and has more in-depth information. However, you don't have to use the browser at all during setup: you can connect the Polar M600 to your phone and do everything there, without having to use a PC. There are a couple of bespoke Polar watch faces that will show you daily activity, so you can see where you are with your target at a glance, which help boost the fitness tracker side of the M600. Polar M600 review: 24/7 activity monitoring Before we get to actual sports tracking, the M600 wants to monitor what you're doing all the time. We mentioned that the Polar Flow has a lifestyle approach and this is has, breaking down your day into sleep, resting, sitting, low, medium or high activity. With this in mind, you're presented with your progress through your day on the watch face. One of the elements of this is steps, which we feel is a little too enthusiastic about awarding you a "step". It's a hard thing to measure, as when we measured physical steps, the results seemed accurate enough, but in an average day in the office, we seemed to accrue many more steps through other movements. Compared to Fitbit tracking, for example, it's a lot easier to hit your step target with the M600, suggesting that it's a lot more sensitive to movement than it perhaps should be. Steps isn't really an absolute measure, however, so if it's steps you're interested in, this probably isn't the device for you. If you're inactive for too long you'll get inactivity alerts and these aren't just reminders to move, they get logged in Polar Flow, so you'll feel the enduring shame. If that's not a motivator, we don't know what is. One of the nice aspects of Polar Flow is that it reports on your day, week and month assessing your activity and telling you what difference that has made to your life. Polar M600 review: Running and sports functions Press that button on the front and the Polar app opens on the M600. There are two sections, one to check your daily activity in more detail and the second to start recording a sport. Polar gives you freedom to choose your sport profiles to suit the activities. For many this will be running, cycling or swimming, but there's a full range of sports to choose from, like badminton, dance, football or plain old walking, for example. That's great, because you don't have to compromise on categorising your activity. Want to record your dog walking? No problem. Want to record your Friday rowing session? No problem. Pocket-lint For outdoor sports you have GPS tracking, so there are different profiles for pool and open water swimming for example, which we really like and you only have to have the sports on your watch that you actually need. Don't want "other outdoor"? You can remove it. Head into the Polar Flow website and you get to customise your sports profiles further, changing the information you see on your watch, which it really clever. Once you've selected your activity, the watch sensors fire up, looking for GPS and turning on the optical heart rate sensor on the rear. You can start the activity immediately, or wait for those things sensors to lock on, but again, with time being precious, it's sometimes good to get going without having to wait. We've found the GPS to lock on quickly, however, so there's never really been too much of a delay in getting started.  During your sport, you're presented with a number of screens with relevant information, based on the activity you're doing. For running you get a main screen that's similar to Polar's other devices, like the V800. The M600 has the advantage of colour, so as you move through different heart rate zones, the colour of the HR readout will change too, for at-a-glance information. There's also clear indiction of pace and distance when running. Swimming isn't as well served as it could be, with pool swimming lacking the option to detect lengths automatically like the Apple Watch 2 does. That leaves you with heart rate tracking and time, which is good enough. We also found that the flow of the water was able to swipe through screens, so we'd often stop a set in the pool with something different on the display. Pocket-lint With Android Wear automatically dimming the display, Polar has added the option to have the display always on. This means you can glance and see the stats without having to touch and avoids the problem of not being able to view the screen without an over exaggerated gesture. That will eat more battery, but if you're busting a gut trying to beat your 10k PB run, you won't care, you'll just need to keep an easy eye on your pace. If there was one thing we'd want to boost the watch's sporting credentials, it's another button. We'd love a start/stop button, rather than having to use the display, but that's a minor thing. There's also no automatic detection for your activities, but sitting closer to a serious running watch we think that's fine: it will differentiate between activity levels in the daily tracking anyway, so there's no harm in selecting the sport you're doing for detailed tracking. One of the great things is that the Polar Flow website provides a lot more information than you'll find on other platforms. It will give you an overview of your running progress, it will estimate how much fatigue you might be carrying over from earlier workouts as a guide to whether you're over or under training. You can also sign-up to training programmes, meaning there's a lot on offer, beyond your actual running stats. Polar M600 review: GPS and heart rate performance There's a wide degree of variation in performance with the latest crop of sports gadgets, something that's seen widespread reporting about accuracy. The Polar M600 performs well in tracking via GPS, with some really accurate route tracking and good distance recording. Polar has put six LEDs in the optical heart rate sensor on the back of the M600, aiming to ensure it's as accurate as it can be. Naturally, using the optional chest strap will give better results, but wrist measurement is all about convenience. The M600 performs fairly well, but we have seen some inconsistent HR results at times. Pocket-lint We've seen a fairly slow start at times, with the first 10 minutes or so seeing a slow build-up of heart rate, not quite reflecting the real rate increase. We've also had some runs where the watch would occasionally show a blank result, as though it wasn't recording, but it was. On checking the results afterwards, there's no sign of drop-out.  To verify what was happening, we tested it against a Garmin Forerunner 610 with chest strap. The Garmin was faster to respond to rate changes, more accurately reflecting the build-up of heart rate at the start of the run, as well as responding faster to some sprint sections we threw in. However, at the end of the run, both showed an average of 152bpm and both showed the same distance covered and same average pace. So, although there are some anomalies with the results, that overall doesn't have a huge impact on the bigger picture of runs when using the Polar M600. Outside of running we've found it to deliver some good results and we're impressed it manages to offer a consistent result when swimming, for example.  Polar M600 review: A full Android Wear experience That's where most sports devices would reach the limit of their functionality, but sitting on the Android Wear platform, the Polar M600 offers a whole lot more. You get a full range of alerts and notifications and if you have an Android smartphone, this really is a first class offering, especially compared to the arrangement on some other sports devices. It's something that's offered by other Polar watches and some Garmin devices, but here you're supported by the Android community for your functionality, not just Polar. Pocket-lint We've mentioned apps and one of the aspects that the M600 gets from Android Wear is Bluetooth headphone and music support. You can connect any Bluetooth headphones you like, but music support is limited to Google's Play Music service and you have to download and sync that from your phone, which is a bit of a faff so it's worth only syncing music for running, but we love not having to carry that vintage iPod on the run.  Expanding out into other Android Wear highlights, you have Google Maps for navigation while you're connected to your phone, support for Ok Google voice controls, so you can speak replies to messages and so on. Then you have all the fun stuff, like being able to pause your Spotify music from your watch, controlling Netflix over your Chromecast, or getting Citymapper directions right on your wrist.  Although Android Wear has a bad rep from lacklustre early devices, the Polar M600 isn't one of them. This is a sports watch that benefits from a huge range of extra functions enabled by Android Wear, resulting in something fun and functional. In many ways, the Polar M600 is currently without compare. Verdict The Polar M600 is a fusion of smartwatch and sports device. It takes Android's platform and laces in sports and fitness tracking functions, but maintains a balance that some devices don't manage. It succeeds in being both where others have failed. It feels like a proper Polar sports watch, boosted by the best of Android Wear. For an Android smartphone user, this is a device that's worth serious consideration. If you've been put off by Android Wear so far, this is how to do Android Wear right. It's not about bland presentation, it's about underpinning something more exciting.

Store bosses were able to identify the 30-year-old from the Google Street View stills. Although, as per Google policy, her face was blurred they were able to identify her from her distinctive white top she was wearing.  She wore the same outfit when she was arrested. 'I'm an ex-Teesside University student so I thought I would see my old stomping ground, and as soon as I spotted it I thought 'that seemed a bit strange,' said Peter Darby, an IT worker who came across the images.  'I moved further down the street and you could see a bloke pursuing her. By the end she was going full speed. Run! Store Bosses were able to identify her from her distinctive white top she was wearing for the robbery and when she was arrested. And she thought she got away with it. McIvor flees the store as caught on Google Street View with a worker in tow  'You could tell as soon as you looked at the pictures that something was up as she came out of there very angrily. 'She was running around with the Sports Direct bag and it was obvious she was up to no good.'  The images were filmed on June 19 in the town center at around 2.45pm.

The women, who has been a heroin addict since 16, also took drugs in prison and used someone else's name to get out of trouble. After the case, a friend of McIvor, said: 'She's harmless but she gets into trouble for shoplifting quite a bit.

Everything you need to know about Google's new Wi-Fi router The Daily Dot 10/8/2016 Amrita Khalid © Photo via Google Google Wifi If your Wi-Fi signal is slow or patchy in some areas of the house, Google may soon solve that problem.  Google previewed a slate of new products this week that includes Google Wi-Fi, a set of Wi-Fi points designed to be placed throughout your house. The concept is known as "mesh Wi-Fi." It uses multiple Wi-Fi points instead of the centralized router systems most of us are accustomed to. Google Wi-Fi points are expandable—you can buy as many as you need—and are designed to connect to each other.  Interestingly enough, Google only just released a Wi-Fi router last year, Google OnHub. According to Ars Technica, if you own a Google OnHub already, you don't need to pick one over the other. A Google OnHub router can be used as a node in your Google Wi-Fi network. © Provided by Daily Dot If you're a heavy gamer, love streaming video, or live in a house with people that fit those categories, mesh Wi-Fi is certainly an attractive prospect. Parents will no doubt love that Google Wi-Fi's app allows you to shut off the Wi-Fi during homework time or whenever else you choose.  But there are a couple of reasons that Google Wi-Fi may give you pause. Mesh networks have gotten a bad wrap in recent years for still being slow, spotty, and expensive. Mesh networks have traditionally been used in emergency and disaster scenarios.  Mesh networks are cheap to set up and require no centralized network for set-up. According to Wired, the only way to shut down a mesh network is to shut individually shut down every node in the network. Recent advancements in mesh technology have been faster and more consistent, but the jury's still out on how fast Google Wi-Fi will be when compared to a centralized Wi-Fi network.  Google Wi-Fi is priced at $129 for a single pack and $299 for a three-pack. It's being released in November. A single access point should cover a 1,500 square-foot home.  Go to MSN Home More in Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY The world's most valuable stamps Lovemoney 6 Social Security changes coming in 2017 U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More Watch these crystals appear to be born in an amazing time-lapse video The Daily Dot Legendary animator Hayao Miyazaki is unretiring to make one more Studio Ghibli film The Daily Dot Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon get top roles with Trump, blurring lines between establishment, alt-right The Daily Dot Hilarious Barack Obama, Joe Biden memes are having fun at Donald Trump's expense The Daily Dot The Daily Dot View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Mr Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, the search engine’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager, Anglophone West Africa, in a statement on Saturday said that the application would be available on Google Play and the App Store. “Like most Nigerian parents, you love helping your kids learn new things about the world. For instance, you spend a lot of time with them on YouTube, watching videos that interest them. “You skip videos not meant for their age, just to explore the sing along songs on HooplaKidz, Sesame Street, history and science channels. The fun is catching, but your alertness is important! “With the newly introduced YouTube Kids App now available for download in Nigeria, your kids can enjoy more videos on every topic in the world; protected from adult-type content, while you do other things,” Kola-Ogunlade said. The Google manager said that the app, which had parental controls, would help the parent to control the kid’s experience, without meddling in their fun. “A parent can determine how much exploring their kids can do, by turning on the search or limit the child’s experience by turning it off. “The timer feature on YouTube Kids alerts your kids when time is up, by limiting screen time. “The sound settings allow you to turn off the sounds, so you can catch your breath while your kid watches in peace,” he said. According to him, the YouTube Kids App comes with a Pass Code, as there is ”no sneaking around watching when I am not there” and a logged-out experience. “The logged out experience enables one to enjoy the fun, no sign-in hassles, features like uploading, sharing, liking etc, linked to accounts have been removed,” Kola-Ogunlade said.

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsGoogle Didn’t Hold Back on the iPhone 7’s Camera Performance (GOOG) Google Didn’t Hold Back on the iPhone 7’s Camera Performance (GOOG) Google-parent Alphabet Inc. says its flagship smartphone has the best camera ever made. October 8, 2016 Cristina Lee Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently launched its newest flagship smartphone, the Pixel alongside Pixel XL, and boy, did the Mountain View, Calif.-based company made some bold claims. According to Google exec Sundar Pichai, the Pixel has the single best phone camera ever made. And to erase all doubts that Google is coming after the iPhone 7, the event was filled with savage burns directed at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple is all about camera performance and it’s been one of the key features that’s consistently improving with every reiteration of the iPhone. To illustrate how deeply Apple cares about camera performance, execs say that over 800 engineers worked on the iPhone 7’s camera, piecing together over 200 components within the teeny tiny camera modules. And because of the improved hardware, the iPhone 7 featured a bump that most users are unhappy about. Google execs made not-so-subtle digs at the iPhone 7 camera bump during the launch. In a live demo, the bump has been mentioned one time too many, highlighting the fact that the Pixel does not have this much-maligned design. The execs added that Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC assembled the Pixel smartphones. Google also bragged about the Pixel’s camera performance, highlighting the fact that its newest smartphone scored 89 out of 100 in a DxOMark Mobile test. On the same test, the iPhone 7 scored an 86. DxOMark is known for rating cameras and lenses for smartphones and high-end DSLRs alike using sophisticated analysis software. However, it’s worth noting that DxOMark has yet to review iPhone 7 Plus’ camera. Google also slammed one of most common sources of frustration among iPhone users, the limited storage. As you know, photos and videos eat a lot of space and if you’re using an iOS device, then you might be familiar with the annoying storage full popups. According to Brian Rakowski, Google’s vice president of product management, Pixel and the Pixel XL users can kiss these “painful” Storage Full popups goodbuy because their flagship smartphones will come with “free unlimited storage for photos and videos at full resolution.” Moreover, both the regular and the XL Pixels share the same features, which means, Google is not putting a premium on extra/special features, something that’s been a tradition at Apple. To top it all off, the Pixel smartphones will be the first to feature Google’s newest digital assistant, the company’s answer to Apple’s Siri. Other notable Pixel camera features include the ability to edit photos. Google’s Pixel smartphone features a sleek, aluminum and glass form factor.

It seems unlikely, and here's why. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 8, 2016 at 9:22AM Image source: Google.  Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google recently announced its first in-house smartphones, known as the Pixel and the Pixel XL (a larger variant of the Pixel). These are premium devices, starting at $649 for the base Pixel model (5 inches) and $769 for the base Pixel XL model (5.5 inches). These phones currently use a Snapdragon 821 applications processor produced by wireless chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). However, according to Bloomberg, Google has expressed interest in building its own custom silicon out in time. This leads to a very interesting question: Will Google develop its own applications processors for future Pixel smartphones? Google could probably do it Putting together a reasonably competent smartphone-oriented applications processor these days isn't too difficult, especially if one has the money to spend (and Google can clearly afford it). Many of the key intellectual properties that go into a mobile processor -- CPU cores, graphics, memory controllers, eMMC, and so on -- can be licensed from third parties such as ARM Holdings, Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH: IGNMF), and Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS). One major hurdle that Google would undoubtedly face in trying to build its own custom chip is the fact that it could not easily license a cellular modem to integrate into such a chip. Google would either have to spend a lot of time, money, and effort to even hope to build a reasonably competitive cellular modem or it would need to use stand-alone modems from the likes of Qualcomm or Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the two suppliers of modems into the latest iPhone.  The stand-alone solution is less than ideal because the current Pixel phone uses a chip that integrates the modem onto the same piece of silicon as the applications processor, which helps to reduce board size as well as power consumption. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been dealing with stand-alone modems for as long as the iPhone has been around, but for Google it would represent a step back from the solution that it's already using.  In order to build a differentiated solution, Google could choose to build unique intellectual properties to integrate alongside the core technologies licensed from the above vendors. Custom hardware to accelerate certain common smartphone functions (thereby improving performance and/or lowering power consumption), for example, could be worthwhile projects for a potential Google custom silicon team to pursue if it really wants to build its own chips. Would it be worthwhile? The impression that I get is that most of the companies that build their own applications processors don't actually produce differentiated (or, frankly, even worthwhile) solutions relative to what can be purchased from the likes of Qualcomm and MediaTek. Apple's in-house chip efforts have been quite successful, and Samsung's (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been reasonable, but efforts from the likes of Huawei's HiSilicon and LG have been mostly underwhelming. If Google were a major smartphone vendor and its core revenue/profitability depended on selling large volumes of ultra-premium smartphones, then there might be a case to spend all of the time and effort to build in-house applications processors, though there's no guarantee that it'd be as good as, let alone better than, what Google could buy from Qualcomm. However, given that the Google Pixel is unlikely to be a particularly high volume seller, especially when it's charging premium prices, and given the fierce competition in the Android landscape from companies that have been at this longer than Google has been, I doubt that there's much of a (rational) business justification for such an effort. I'm not betting on it My guess is that Google will build a couple more generations of these Pixel devices, but they ultimately won't sell all that well. At that point, I expect the effort around the Pixel to be scaled back, if not outright shuttered. If the case for an in-house applications processor is tenuous at this point, I suspect that it'll seem downright silly if and when it becomes clear that the Pixel is a nice hobby, but not really a worthwhile product category for Google to pursue over the long haul.

We have compiled a list of beautiful looking, productivity yielding Calendar apps for Android users.  ( Tapir Apps | Google Store ) Advertisement Facebook recently launched its Events App for iOS, and users can plan their attendance to nearby events and sync with their friends to enjoy some quality time together. Events App also features a neat integration with Apple's proprietary Calendar app, making it easy to keep track of the conferences, concerts, and parties that users might want to attend. However, Facebook Events is only available on iOS at the moment, so users of Google's mobile OS might miss out. That is why we listed some of the best calendar apps for Android users. aCalendar (Free or $4.99 for full features) Ranking first on many reviewers' lists of calendars, aCalendar surely deserves its place at the top. The app features a solid assortment of features, such as many types of views, multiple widgets and more. To those who can get by with basic tools, it comes at zero additional cost. Productivity oriented users might want to fork out $4.99 for the full version, which comes with more control features and gesture controls. Users who downloaded aCalendar from Google Store gave it a 4.4/5, which is the highest mark on our list. CloudCal ($2.50 for full features) Android users get one of the most intuitive and easy-on-the-eyes ways of showing how busy they are on any given day. ClouldCal uses a system dubbed Magic Circles, which depicts days as clock faces, with each activity corresponding to a circle (or slice) of a different color. The app features a neat integration of customizable views, calendar import and gesture support, and it plays nice with apps such as Google Maps, Uber, and Waze. Keep in mind that in order to use the transportation apps you need to shell out $2.50 for the Pro version. Download CloudCal from Google Store, where it scores 4.3/5. Google Calendar (Free) Google's proprietary Calendar app delivers a clean, bright interface and a multitude of views: traditional month and week views alongside schedule-focused views. Integration with your Gmail account lets you automatically sap information about flights, hotel accommodation, and restaurant reservations from your emails and create events based on said info. You may also use it for reminders and to-do lists. Users may download Google Calendar from Google Store, where it ranks 4.1/5. DigiCal (Free) DigiCal is a versatile Android calendar that offers a myriad of view modes and widgets. Users can have an overview or a detailed breakdown of their schedule, thanks to the day, week, month or year-based view mode. The app plays nice with Exchange, Outlook and Google Calendar. What is more, DigiCal lets you know when to pack an umbrella thanks to its embedded weather forecast, and its invitation management and time zone features are quite useful, as well. Get DigiCal from Google Store, where it sits at 4.3/5. TAG Calendar app, Facebook Events App, Android Apps, Calendar, Google Calendar © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

If you did, you should go check it out. The post is Explore important insights from your data — automatically. I have access to a number of Google Analytics accounts, and I can say this about the suggestions shown in this new feature from Google Analytics – they are worth looking at and thinking about. A couple of the accounts I looked at offered 10 suggestions for changes. Some of these suggestions simply point out that some content on the site you are looking at saw increases in traffic recently, pointing out the URLS of that content. Frankly, that is what inspired me to write this post – it seemed to be a topic related to other posts on my site that had been drawing lots of traffic. If you haven’t been paying much attention to the analytics related to your website, it can be a helpful thing to do. I also recommend spending some time on the Website of Google’s Analytic’s evangelist Avinash Kaushic, reading articles such as The Biggest Mistake Web Analysts Make… And How To Avoid It! I like how he focuses upon business insights, which is something that most site owners want to see. Your analytics program can do more than just tell you how many people are visiting your website – it can offer you suggestions and ideas on how to improve you site and provide a better experience to visitors of your site. The automated assistant suggestions can provide some ideas for changes you can make from the data collected by your analytics program. The blog post tells us that Google Analytics will keep on offering new automated assistant suggestions over time, so it’s worth revisiting those and seeing if they update over time. Please note that this feature of Google Analytics is available only in the mobile app, so that’s where you should look. It’s something that I will now be looking at on client’s sites, and something I recommend that everyone look at. I do think it’s worth using Google’s machine learning to see if it can offer actual business insights that can make a difference to your business. If you give it a shot, and it provides you with a helpful suggestion, please let us know. Thanks.

Bill Slawski says: 09/10/2016 at 6:15 pm Hi Calgary SEO Solutions, Whether or not you agree with the suggestions in this new automated assistant or not; the chance to receive suggestions that might be founded upon actual business insights is a good opportunity. The Occam’s Razor website is definitely a thoughtful one, worth spending some time at. Dave Durden says: 09/11/2016 at 3:20 am Hi Bill, This was a real eyeopener, thank you! It’s interesting to see how automation and AI are turning simple data into actionable insight. I’m intrigued to see the extent to which automation will evolve in the future – perhaps fully automated consultancy companies? Bill Slawski says: 09/11/2016 at 11:50 am Hi Dave, I don’t know if we will see fully automated consulting; but it is interesting that Google is offering these suggestion. I guess we will learn how helpful they are by keeping an eye upon them, and seeing what they suggest. Soti says: 09/11/2016 at 12:52 pm Hi Bill, i just wanted to thank you for opening my eyes. The new analytics of google, that’s similar what i searched for. Thank you. Bill Slawski says: 09/11/2016 at 6:03 pm Hi Soti, You’re welcome. I thought this was interesting enough so that as many people as possible should hear about it – it provides all of us a boost when it comes to analytics, even those of us who don’t know how to take advantage of the statistics associated with our sites. Adrian says: 09/12/2016 at 4:26 am I came across this new feature yesterday and my first reaction was …. blah another Google trick to try to get me to commit to bigger spending on their ad network, but then i checked again and noticed that some of the reports are very insightful and after all tips coming from the horses mouth are always to be given some consideration ! Ashish says: 09/13/2016 at 12:58 pm I have been using Google analytics for quite a while now, Although it provides the good information but times to times it is not always correct if we compare it to other premium services. Beside that I really loved your article. Keep posting Thanks Chris says: 09/13/2016 at 8:56 pm I’m glad I came across this tonight. I didn’t even realize there was more insight and advice coming straight from Google that I could use for my business and clients sites. Thank you! Jack says: 09/15/2016 at 8:58 am I second that. Though the data is not accurate, and I personally find some number being listed wrong there. But the thing is, those are just estimates, of the past month’s trend. And the are just precise approximations. I often study Google trends along with that, make a guess on the exact search volume which a potential keyword might fetch. What do you think about this method, Bill? Hussain Omar says: 09/16/2016 at 1:32 am Hey Bill, This is my first visit to your blog and I really loved it. And yes, the analytics software should provide more than just visits figures, I think Moz and SEMrush do provide suggestions on the paid subscriptions, but if Google will provide it, that will be a nice feature to try. Thanks for sharing! Regards Hussain Stephen Love says: 09/16/2016 at 3:56 pm Hi Bill, Thanks for the information and the heads up, having just passed my analytics exam i will certainly follow up on some of the links you have provided to get a better understanding of how this could benefit us. Matthew says: 09/16/2016 at 10:54 pm Hi Bill, Thanks for sharing the articles within your post. I’m still relatively beginner level in understanding Google Analytics and I took the advice you shared on this article which has helped my understanding greatly so I appreciate it. These were things I never knew to think about until I read here so I look forward to many more of your posts. Am going to experiment with the automated assistant suggestions in the mobile app. Abdul Waheed says: 09/19/2016 at 10:20 am Great info about analytics, thanks for sharing that, Bill says: 09/19/2016 at 1:07 pm Hi Bill, Thanks for pointing this out. The suggestions provided by Google Analytics helped me identify a couple of new topics to write about. Interesting that it is only available on the mobile app. Bill Slawski says: 09/19/2016 at 2:11 pm Hi Bill, I wondered about the availability of this feature only on Mobile, too. I guess they wanted to see if they could influence more people to use the mobile app, by making this feature exclusive to mobile. Bill Slawski says: 09/19/2016 at 2:13 pm Hi Abdul, You’re welcome. 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 09/19/2016 at 2:17 pm Hi Matthew, I hope it goes well. The suggestions I’ve been seeing look interesting. I think implementing those would be helpful in getting you to learn more. teddy slim says: 09/19/2016 at 6:14 pm Clearly, Google is trying to own the web and I’m not with Google monopolizing the net Candice S says: 09/19/2016 at 8:52 pm Bill thank your your post! yes google analytics is not very accurate and everytime a customer enter by mobile and change to view in desktop it simply count as two! but the view duration keep underestimate! yet the good thing about analytics is they can filter bots access.will check the automated assistant and get back again here after testing. hope google can do a better job! Harish Negi says: 09/20/2016 at 6:21 am Google is making Life easy for bloggers. Will definitely use this. Thanks for bringing into knowledge. Chicago SEO Pros says: 09/21/2016 at 2:56 pm Any help from Google, in any form, is much appreciated. Sometimes my brain gets so wrapped up in knots trying to decipher what little reliable data there is. Thank you for the tips. faran says: 09/23/2016 at 6:36 am first i wouldn’t know what to do with my writing but google makes it easier, and also word press gives direction. thank you for you information sharing David S. Freid says: 09/24/2016 at 3:56 pm Thank you for your enlightening article, I was unaware of this feature and will look forward to installing the mobile app. I will also share my thought about considering any suggestions coming from this Google Bot. (i.e. Automated Assitant) It has been my experience that the G-Bots all support and follow the same Google Guidelines. Just saying… David S. Freid says: 09/24/2016 at 4:04 pm Great Post! I was unaware of this feature and will look forward to the app. I also would like to share that personally, I would have to consider any suggestions coming from a G Bot. It has been my experience that all G Bots support and follow the same Google Guidelines. I should add, this coming from one that considers himself a “Google Guideline Junkie”. “Real SEO has no ending… you can always something to optimize, better. Jim says: 09/24/2016 at 5:12 pm Hi Bill, do you agree if google analytic will track all your data and decrease your position in SERP ? I need your reason.Thank you Bill Sara Mazher says: 09/25/2016 at 2:58 am It is interesting that Google is offering these suggestion. I guess we will learn how helpful they are by keeping an eye upon them, and seeing what they suggest. Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:27 am Hi Jim, This new feature from Google on the Mobile Google App provides machine learned insights for you to apply to your site and has nothing to do with affecting your position in Search results. Take a look at the suggestions that it offers, and see if they are something that you want to apply to your site; you don’t have to, but it’s possible that they might help you site. Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:33 am Hi Teddy, I’m not sure that this GA assistant is aimed at Google monopolizing the Web. Take a look at the suggestions, and if you want to follow them, try them out. If you think they may cause a problem, then don’t. I do think they are worth looking at, though. Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:36 am Hi Candice, I hope it offers you some helpful suggestions. I’ve been noticing the suggestions have been updating, but the Assistant was right that I should write a post like this one, geared towards providing some suggestions and advice the way this one has. Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:38 am Hi Harish, I hope it is helpful for you. 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:55 am Hi David, I hope the suggestions it may offer you are helpful ones. Wade Cockfield says: 09/25/2016 at 8:50 pm Thanks for the article looks like I will have to start using the app rather than desktop. Alisha says: 09/27/2016 at 12:46 am Thanks for sharing these useful informations regarding google analytics. It is really helpful for people like me. Lakhyajyoti says: 09/27/2016 at 9:48 am I have been using GA Assistant for last few weeks. Really love the features of the new tool. Thanks for the awesome share. Kettletop Tea says: 09/27/2016 at 10:49 am Great blog. Fully informative. I am also seo executive , so thank for blog. David says: 09/27/2016 at 6:57 pm Not gonna lie, I didn’t even know there was a mobile app for Google Analytics (though it doesn’t surprise me). I’ve never really found the need to check my analytics when I was somewhere I couldn’t access my computer, but I guess I’ll have to download it now if only to check out this apparently mobile-exclusive feature! Mike Mallery says: 09/29/2016 at 8:38 pm Hi Bill. I stumbled upon your blog, and I can say that I am happy I did. Great information to be found here. More on the subject, though – I always find it interesting that so many businesses are looking for the answers found within GA; however, they always seem to be terrified of anything technology related. As you pointed out, there is a great deal of information to be found within GA. With a little effort and understanding, so many business owners could have a much better grasp on the performance of their site(s) and how they can improve. However, I suppose that ignorance keeps some of us in business. Not to drag this out too much longer, but thank you for the links to these articles I have missed. They are on my ‘to read’ list over the weekend. Keep churning out the great content. patel vaishali says: 09/29/2016 at 11:23 pm Yes, I am using Google Assistant by the first day of its launch. It is awesome. Machine learning goes beyond its expectations. Google is back with the bang. seo service says: 09/30/2016 at 3:49 am Nice post Bill. Nice informative post.I knew about the Google Analytics toll which is available on PC but didn’t know about the mobile version of it. I’ll definitely try it. Noman says: 09/30/2016 at 8:23 am Really good news for us.This time we will get a lot of valuable data.but what about desktop user? I think this service must be available for desktop user too.thanks for your informative post. Bill Slawski says: 09/30/2016 at 11:31 am Hi Mike, Google Analytics contains some useful information, but the suggestions that it offers can sometimes be missed by people when they use it. The value of this automated assistant is in its ability to make clear suggestions that are easy to follow. It suggested that I write a post that was similar to other ones based upon information that was very actionable, which lead me to write this post. I’m glad I listened to it – it was good advice, and a lot of people seem to have missed the Google blog post announcing the GA assistant, which I wouldn’t have seen because I hadn’t been using the mobile version of the app. I need to go look now, and see if it has any updates. 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 09/30/2016 at 11:33 am Hi Patel, I’m happy with the suggestions that I’ve been seeing from the automated assistant. Yes, it’s analytics and not SEO, but it is helping me improve my website, and there is value in that. 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 09/30/2016 at 11:37 am Hi SEO Service, I can only guess that Google wanted to see if they could get more people using the mobile version of Google Analytics if they offered the Assistant exclusively through that mobile version. It forced me to give it a try, and it was worth trying, I’m liking what it is suggesting. Going to try it out again right now. Bill Slawski says: 09/30/2016 at 11:46 am Hi Noman, I’ve taken to working with my phone and tablet next to my desktop computer – the notifications from those tell me about whether I have new messages on social media. I suspect that Google might make that Automated assistant available on desktop versions of Google Analytics some time soon. We’ll see when they do. Matt says: 09/30/2016 at 4:04 pm It is honestly sad that I am an SEO and didn’t know this. I’m going to go check it out right now. Thank you for sharing Bill! Bren Murphy says: 10/01/2016 at 4:42 am Hi Bill, It’s a nice new feature and I have given it full reign across my web service – let’s see how well it works! Very positive about it so far, Thanks Bren Munna Hossain says: 10/04/2016 at 11:43 am I am really happy to read your article. This is really an awesome news for us that we can use google automated assistant. But I think it will be more helpful if desktop users get this facilities. Thanks you for your wonderful article. Entersoft says: 10/04/2016 at 6:01 pm Google automated assistant is good, although it is not quite “there” yet! I look forward to reading “the biggest mistakes”. Nice work. Cheers! Terrence says: 10/04/2016 at 7:24 pm This is very much interesting. Google analytics is very much helpful to track down how many traffic do you have on your website as well as the keywords of what users always search in a certain category. Good to know about Google assistant, ’till now, I’m still in the process of navigating this stuff. Bill Slawski says: 10/04/2016 at 7:59 pm Hi Entersoft, Google Analytics is a mature product, so I’m not sure that we will see many “biggest mistakes”. The suggestions the Assistant is offering are based upon information that may or may not be being picked up on by someone looking at analytics. I have seen up to 10 suggestions at a time per site I’ve looked at. I can see people seeing value from the Assistant. Bill Slawski says: 10/04/2016 at 8:03 pm Hi Munna, I think good advice is still good advice regardless if it is delivered on a desktop app or a mobile one. I hope that people don’t let it being available only on mobile stop them from using the assistant. nandita says: 10/05/2016 at 1:16 am This is truly a great post @Bill It would a smarter method and it will be very useful. pcmate says: 10/09/2016 at 7:50 am Hi there Bill, I have just founded your blog and my first impression is amazing! You don’t give just techniques about SEO, but you also inform about new things about it. It’s true that Google is helping us lately a lot with this program and also AMP. Bill Slawski says: 10/09/2016 at 8:38 pm Hi pcmate, Thank you. I’m happy to hear that you are enjoying my posts. Tha automated assistant is an interesting feature from Google. I was a little upset that the last time I logged into the mobile app, there were no suggestions for me – it was nice seeing some. Sarvesh says: 10/14/2016 at 6:21 am Thanks Bill for such informative article. Really most of the internet user not aware about this new automated assistant. Marbella says: 10/16/2016 at 12:47 pm I have been using GA Assistant for last few weeks. Really love the features of the new tool. Thanks for share ,it is awesome. Ascendant SEO says: 10/21/2016 at 1:14 pm Thanks for your time in sharing this article. Analytics have definitely yielded a few helpful nuggets over the years for us. Obviously, it’s always helpful to be open to solutions and opportunities wherever they appear from. This topic relates in my mind to the basic issue of whether or not to become a Google Partner and go through the Adwords and Analytics training and certification. It’s interesting to meet people in the SEO space that write off the whole opportunity because they see Google as an opponent. In my experience with the program, I’ve learned a ton and am always reminded that Google has created a huge opportunity for us. Indeed, we need to be careful not to overlook the opportunities right in front of us. Analytics is one of those. shamala says: 11/01/2016 at 10:45 pm Thanks Bill, as always, for your vigilance and thorough patent analysis. InfoCreeds says: 11/06/2016 at 11:31 pm Yeah, that’s great. Google new automated assistant is great and also in India it is released in Local language (Hindi). It is improved after you are using it.

There’s likely a lot more to how Google’s RankBrain approach works, but I came across a patent that seems to be related to the patent I wrote about in that post, and thought it was worth sharing and starting a discussion about. The patent I wrote about in that post was Using concepts as contexts for query term substitutions. The title for this new patent was very similar to that one (Synonym identification based on categorical contexts), and the more recent patent was granted on December 1st of this year. The new patent starts off describing a scenario that is a good example of how it works. The inventors tell us: For example, learning that “restaurants” is a good synonym for “food” in the query [food in San Francisco] is relatively straightforward, because the volume of query traffic including the query term “San Francisco” is very large. For much smaller cities, such as Grey Bull, Wyo., the query stream may have never seen any supporting evidence for this synonym substitution. That both cities are entities that fit into the same category, that of “Cities” means that they could potentially be good synonyms for each other. That’s what the inventors of this patent tell us specifically, using the San Francisco and Grey Bull example: For example, if “San Francisco” and “Grey Bull” are both cities, and “restaurants” is a good synonym for “food” in queries about San Francisco, the synonym relationship may apply to queries related to “Grey Bull” as well. Thus, the category “city” may be considered a useful category when identifying synonyms for query expansion in circumstances such as this. So, we are told that the process involved in this patent is to identify categories from a knowledge base involving a number of entities where other entities within that same category could potentially be synonyms for each other in similar contexts. The process from the patent involves identifying those entities from a query stream, and identifying the category as one that they call a “coherent” category. The patent tells us that a coherent category is one in which a certain threshold of terms tend to co-occur in a query stream involving those entities. The patent tells us, for instance that a category that might include entities that are cities, villages, and towns might see a lot of co-occurring terms involving hotels and roads. If the number of co-occurring terms appearing in that query stream meet a certain threshold, it would be considered a coherent category, and the entities from the same categories could possibly then be used as synonyms for each other. The patent in question is: Synonym identification based on categorical contexts Invented by: Zachary A. Garrett, Takahiro Nakajima, Tasuku Oonishi Assignee: Google US Patent 9,201,945 Granted December 1, 2015 Filed: March 8, 2013 Abstract Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for training recognition canonical representations corresponding to named-entity phrases in a second natural language based on translating a set of allowable expressions with canonical representations from a first natural language, which may be generated by expanding a context-free grammar for the allowable expressions for the first natural language. Take Aways When I wrote about the query term substitution patent I refer to at the start of this post, I included a number of examples of queries that were re-written based upon some substitutions of query terms that might seem reasonable to a search engine looking at words that tended to show up, or co-occur, in a query stream involving those search terms. For instance, someone searching for [New York Yankees stadium] was likely searching for results that involved “baseball” since queries that included “New York Yankees” and “stadium” also often included the term “baseball.” That patent didn’t use the term “co-occur” nor did it explain how a knowledge base might be used to substitute entities that might be in the same categories like this one does, but the idea that a shared context like entity categories can be used to trigger entity substitutions in a query is interesting. It’s worth spending time with both patents and reading through each of them multiple times and thinking about how they are being used.

It applies more on the context which stresses on making a single page more richer in information than trying to divide things into pages. The landing page to targeted keyword theory I believe will slowly start to become less relevant and it would be more of a single landing page rich enough to target what you could think 🙂 Anand Mishra says: 12/23/2015 at 12:11 am I appreciate everything you have added to my knowledge base.

Ravinder Dande says: 12/28/2015 at 4:43 am Hi Bill < I guees I read your recent blog about which you mention in this blog Investigating Google RankBrain and Query Term Substitutions. Bill I would like to know if Google changed the way searching user queries again. afrobeat says: 12/29/2015 at 2:04 pm Nice Finding Bill. This will clearly affect Keywords but won’t affect authority websites. Roy Hen says: 12/30/2015 at 2:03 pm Google plays fair. Some companies spend thousands of dollars on SEO. You can have a great ranking for free if you know what you’re doing. Good piece Alan Clarc says: 01/01/2016 at 8:42 pm I would like to encourage all of you really like your blog. Did you design this website yourself or did you hire someone to do it for you? Please reply as I’m looking to create my own blog and would like to find out where u got this from. Many thanks bookmark this page to your most used service to help get the word out. Bill Slawski says: 01/02/2016 at 4:27 pm Hi Alan, Thank you. The theme I used is one of the default WordPress themes, though I made a number of tweaks to the CSS of the theme, and searched through the Library of Congress Website for the Japanese prints that I used as rotating masthead images on the site. There are a lot of great images there that are old enough to be in the Public Domain, and I’ll probably make more changes as time passes. Daniel says: 01/03/2016 at 9:52 am Hey Bill, Thank you very much about this blog post. As I run my own blog and website – smpro.net I find this most useful. Keep up the good work! Bill Slawski says: 01/03/2016 at 11:30 am Hi Daniel, Happy to hear that you find this post useful. I was excited learning more about how Google was working on rewriting queries, and using Knowledge base information to learn about synonyms. Micahel chrest says: 01/03/2016 at 3:57 pm 2016 should be interesting to see how they deal with this and whats kind of tweaks they have in store for us! Assurance Auto says: 01/04/2016 at 9:05 am A big thank you for this article. It was a little bit difficult to translate for a french guy but I think I understood and learned a lot by reading this.

Still ranking is difficult. Sagor Kundu says: 01/05/2016 at 7:03 am HI I just loved reading your articles. The best thing which I really like about your articles is, you covers each and every thing in your articles which makes your article more helpful. I have seen people love to read those articles more which are easy to understand and can help a lot. And you always write such kind of articles. I would also like to suggest you one thing. You should try to keep your paragraphs short so that people can’t scare before reading that paragraphs. Short and cute paragraphs increase interest of the reader to read the complete article. I hope you wouldn’t mind my suggestion. Either way, Thanks for this wonderful article. winecooler says: 01/07/2016 at 9:50 am Good God! Nearly every day it seems I learn of more ways we are spied on! Thank you, Martin, for bringing this to my attention. Other companies doing this besides Silverpush appear to be Adobe, Drawbridge, Flurry (purchased by Yahoo last year), and Tapad. The only defenses against this for now seem to be, as you said, muting the microphone, or putting enough physical distance between devices so that audible signals cannot be picked up by the microphones. Bill Slawski says: 01/07/2016 at 7:03 pm Hi Winecooler, Silverpush was uncovered by the FTC as being involved in this. I found some other companies doing this type of stuff other than the ones you mention, doing things like combining the audio watermarking with cookies, and using similar tracking. These activities aren’t mentioned much on most SEO sites, and I felt I had to publish something when I say Google publish those patent filings. Rajan says: 01/14/2016 at 5:45 am great bill, your post has broken my every silenced corner. Admiring your post is very beneficial for every newcomers. i understood. Thanks for your post Bill Slawski says: 01/14/2016 at 8:01 am Hi Rajan, I think it helps to get a sense of what Google is tryig to do when it comes to rewriting queries during searches. Sonal Sahrawat says: 01/22/2016 at 3:05 am Hi Bill Slawski, It was a great experience to read your useful post.

Thanks!!!! oshop says: 01/25/2016 at 12:36 am google anything done to hopefully make it better, and I appreciate what he has done today Herts seo says: 01/25/2016 at 6:50 am Hi, I am not sure how google can patent the English language. They haven’t invented synonyms. This is just adding some sophistication to an otherwise rudimentary search. It will be interesting to see the weighting of an exact match vs synonym match. Varun Khatri says: 02/20/2016 at 2:18 am Hi Bill, First to all great post indeed for ever for me because I am newcomer I also require this type of things Thanks alot, please keep sharing.

Please keep sharing Derek Sanders says: 04/03/2016 at 4:24 pm This is a topic near and dear to my heart. When searching for “braces” there are two very different meanings. While orthodontists put on braces there are also neck braces and back braces. Interestingly, when you search “braces” in my city the organic search results are for metal braces for teeth while the images are neck braces. ~Derek Bill Slawski says: 04/03/2016 at 5:05 pm Hi Derek, It is interesting that Google chooses one type of braces for organic search and a different type for image search. You have me wondering from the way you stated that if those results are similar in my location and in other locations. I am seeing braces for teeth in organic results and for images here in San Diego. Richa Sharma says: 04/06/2016 at 4:21 am I just loved reading your post!!!Much of time u spent for that!! it will informative for all newcomer’s. thank you Bill!!! kamaraj says: 04/06/2016 at 10:34 pm i love to read the post the blog is more interesting and fall each and every sentences that is related and useful Bill Slawski says: 04/07/2016 at 7:16 am Hi Kamaraj, Thank you.

One minute a giant bid battle is brewing for Twitter, the next, all but one of its supposed suitors are running for the hills. With Google, Disney and Apple all reportedly ruling out a takeover of the struggling social network, only Salesforce is left in the running, with no guarantee it will come forward with a genuine offer. Twitter has been struggling since its early days as a public company, and some critics would argue that its mistake was joining the stock market in the first place. Now, with its options dwindling fast, it faces a bleak future. Certainly the market thinks its prospects as an independent company are pretty dismal: Twitter’s share price plunged more than 20pc after the news that the number of potential bidders had dropped to one. What a dramatic change in fortunes for a company that burst onto the stock market amid huge fanfare just three years ago. At the time, investors thought they were backing the next Facebook or Google and ploughed into its shares, leaving its founder and early backers sitting on huge fortunes. It floated at $26 a share and by the end of the first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Twitter’s stock price had hit nearly $45: the listing was hailed as a slam-dunk on Wall Street. However, within months, several analysts had downgraded the company, and the blue bird has been back-pedalling ever since. Its shares are now languishing at less than $20. Wall Street is notoriously bad at valuing tech companies, but Twitter is in danger of being remembered alongside other over-hyped ventures that left shareholders with badly burnt fingers, such as Zynga and Groupon. The bidding debacles raises fears that Twitter could have been overvalued like Groupon Twitter’s problems are well documented: it has yet to make a profit and its user numbers have ground to a halt. Management, including founder Jack Dorsey, who has returned as chief executive, seem unsure about how to reverse its fortunes. Its biggest problem perhaps is that Twitter wants to be a real business yet no one has worked out whether one exists. It’s traffic doesn’t generate transactions, like with Google, and users don’t spend long periods on the site, like Youtube or Facebook, so its prospects are uncertain. Maybe a very different future awaits? Some critics think it is best suited to becoming another online public service, along the same lines as Wikipedia. It may sound fanciful but unless Twitter’s management come up with a proper plan soon, the social network’s days may be numbered. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey returned to the floundering social network Credit: Bloomberg Cautionary tale The fate of Twitter should provide a cautionary tale for UK investors as they ponder the forthcoming return of Misys to the stock market this month. The software giant’s boss insists that it has been transformed. He would say that, of course. Nadeem Syed and senior management are sitting on shares worth a staggering £330m, as we reveal today. The company’s private equity backer, Vista, and a long list of investment banks working on the float, also stand to profit handsomely. However, a cynic might argue that the biggest transformation that looks to have taken place is the jump in the company’s debt pile. In the four years Misys has been in private hands, its borrowings have ballooned from £107m to £1.3bn. Misys provides software for the world's biggest banks Credit: Bloomberg Vista points out that Misys has undertaken two big deals since de-listing, and revenue and earnings have also risen during its ownership, but at the relatively pedestrian pace of 0.7 times and two times respectively, against a 12-times jump in debt. This, then, has a strong whiff of the classic private equity flip, which were common before the financial crisis but looked to have been stubbed out after investors had their fingers burnt too many times. Boomerang floats, where companies go private, then return to the stock market, come with a particular health warning, because too often they have undergone little real change during private ownership.   In the case of Misys, there is even more reason to be sceptical, given its dubious record last time it was a public company. Its last couple of years were so uninspiring that when Vista swooped in 2012, some investors almost seemed relieved to see the back of it. This time around, the company needs to execute a textbook float, or its backers will have to face a full-scale City revolt.

That omnipotence was on full display at Home's debut in San Francisco (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)   PCMag.com Compared with Amazon's Echo, Google Home -- a compact speaker you can ask to turn off the lights, check the weather, and play music -- might seem like a latecomer to the smart home party. It doesn't arrive until November, while the Echo has been conversing with connected home enthusiasts for nearly two years and has two spinoff devices, the Echo Dot and Tap. But the $129 Google Home has one huge advantage over the Alexa-powered Echo, Siri, and every other personal digital assistant on the market: Google already knows everything about you and pretty much everything that's on the internet. That omnipotence was on full display at Home's debut in San Francisco yesterday, where PCMag got to play with it. All you have to do is say is "OK, Google, tell me about my day," and the diminutive speaker launches into a monologue about your life. It will tell you the weather, how long it will take you to get to work, what's on your calendar, and a news briefing from a source of your choice. All of that is pulled from Google products you probably already use, like Gmail, Calendar, and Maps, though you can disable access to certain corners of the Google ecosystem if you want to. Of course, Google Home also has access to Google's Web search, which means instant answers to a huge variety of questions, from the New England Patriots' season record (3-1) to the name of the Canadian prime minister (Justin Trudeau). Google Home also works well as a music server, beaming songs from a variety of cloud sources. At launch, you'll be able to chose from Spotify, Pandora, YouTube Music, Google Play Music, and TuneIn. Like everything else, playing audio is customizable. You can simply tell Home to play some jazz, or you can ask it to play a curated Spotify playlist on your living room surround sound system, with Google Cast making the connection. To accomplish the latter, you'd say something like "OK, Google. Play Beyoncé on my speakers," assuming they're connected to a Chromecast Audio. Google Home is always listening, and you can say "OK, Google" any time you want it to respond. In the crowded demo room, with many journalists and Google employees all speaking at once, it only understood about half of the commands I tried. But Google says that its omnidirectional microphone is designed to filter out anything that's not a human voice, so it should work well in a quieter room. To adjust the volume, there's a touch interface on the top of the speaker that's reminiscent of an iPod click wheel or a rotary telephone. You slide your finger in a clockwise circular motion, and lights illuminate to indicate increased volume. The device's design is inspired by wineglasses and candles, so it looked great in the Martha Stewart-esque demo room. It will also likely bring a touch of class to your living room or kitchen whether or not you've hired an interior designer. The speaker grille, which takes up the bottom of the device, is interchangeable and snaps on with a magnet. Both metal and fabric grilles in various colors are available. If you want Google Home to temporarily stop listening, you can press the mute button on the rear of the speaker. It's the only physical button, which seems appropriate for a device that's designed for voice interaction. Google Home will come with an Android and iOS companion app, which is still under development. It can do things like adjust which news sources or music libraries are connected, as well as control your home's lights and temperature while you're away. (For automation, Home works with Philips Hue, Nest, Samsung SmartThings, and IFTTT). I was only offered a brief glimpse of the companion app and wasn't allowed to take photos, but it appeared similar to the Alexa app, albeit with Google's trademark fonts and colors. The big question with Google Home, other than how it stacks up against Echo, is whether or not you're comfortable with giving it so much access to your digital life. Google says you'll be able to prevent Home from accessing certain information sources, but then you'd be robbing the speaker of much of its functionality. Google knows so much about your life anyway that allowing Home to offer that information to you in spoken form probably won't increase your risk of snooping or identity theft.

The idea behind Assistant is that Google wants to build a Google for each person, not just a Google for everyone, Pichai said. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Google chief executive Sundar Pichai proclaimed Tuesday that we're evolving from a mobile-first world to an "AI-first world" -- and, of course, that Google is going to be at the forefront of that evolution. But to do that, Google is investing heavily in mobile -- specifically, smartphones. The tech giant introduced two new phones, the 5-inch Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL, at a San Francisco keynote event. The phones boast a camera that Google said earned a top rating for a smartphone camera, an unlimited amount of online photo storage, and a battery that gives you seven hours of battery life from just 15 minutes of charging. The new Pixel phones carry branding that identify them as "Phone by Google," which is a departure from the old Nexus "partner" branding but a crucial turn in what the company is trying to do: owning the phones as its own. Despite the fact that both are made by HTC, Google takes credit for designing the phones around Google Assistant, the tech giant's answer to Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana. The idea behind Assistant is that Google wants to build a Google for each person, not just a Google for everyone, Pichai said. Users will be able to ask broad questions such as, "OK Google, what do I have to do today?" and more conversational queries that (ideally) won't have your so-called smart assistant flummoxed by your phrasing. "Why should we build hardware?" said Rick Osterloh, Google's newly appointed head of hardware. His answer was something we've heard from Apple for years: that building hardware and software together allows companies to take full advantage of both, by designing them for each other. Yet, while Osterloh borrowed some familiar phrases from Apple, Google's pitch came with a twist. The next revolution, Osterloh said, will take place at the intersection of hardware and software together -- with AI in the middle. "The technology needs to be smart and just work for you," Osterloh said. The Pixel phones start at $649, and will have either 32 GB or 128 GB of storage. It is also compatible with Google's new VR headset, the Daydream View. The phones will come in three colors -- which Google has oddly named "Quite Black," "Very Silver" and "Really Blue." In the United States, it will be a Verizon exclusive. Pixel will also be available unlocked on the Google Store.

Bloomberg photo by Michael Short   Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman Bloomberg     Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a yearlong odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc. unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company's retail efforts. What's more, it's inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc., the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies' in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google's digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon.com Inc.'s Alexa and Apple's Siri. "We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome," UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the U.S., via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It's working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google's online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn't enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. "Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships," he said. Many of Google's past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google's target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, California headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google's sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn't want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product's complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling program through physical and online stores. Google's new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a "journey," gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone's full life cycle after a few generations. On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. "We're in it for the long run," he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavor of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can reabsorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company's sales aspirations. "In markets where we do business, we're definitely going to want meaningful share," he said. "But it's highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume." Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple's devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. "The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system," he said.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   PCMag.com     Google seems to think we live lonely lives. As it positions its Google Home as a flexible virtual assistant, it doesn't seem to know what to do if a Google home is full of different people with different tastes. This is especially key for Google, because its Assistant is dependent on assembling a profile of your lifestyle and desires based on your Google account. Yes, that's creepy; the idea that Google is surveilling you so intensely that it's constructing a profile of all of your tastes and preferences. But that's what it's doing. If you don't like it, don't buy a Google Home. Also, probably don't use Gmail. Setting that aside, at our house, we have three people with different tastes and opinions on things. We have different to-do lists and different sets of reminders, sure, but the more you get into the "intelligent assistant" world, the more answers are going to become different based on preferences. Take the ubiquitous "traffic to work" query that these assistants always like to show in their demos. Most American households have two people in them who go to work at different times, at different places. But that's just the least subtle tip of the iceberg. A smart assistant with knowledge of TV preferences, for instance, could deal with the query "put something on TV that's the next episode of something I was watching." My daughter doesn't want to unwind with Person of Interest, and Steven Universe is not my first choice in entertainment. It's good and all, just not my first choice. That said, folks in a single household shouldn't have their libraries and preferences held completely separate. If my daughter asks me to buy Steven Universe, I shouldn't have to worry about adding a payment method to her account. Google, Amazon, and Apple all have family sharing options on most of their products to solve this problem. Amazon allows multiple accounts on its Echo virtual-assistant products. Just say "switch accounts," and it'll change who it thinks is talking to Alexa. But Google confirmed that Google Home will only work with one account: @saschasegan Hi! Today, Google Home supports a single account on the device but you can use multiple accounts with your music services. This seems to be an early product issue. Google solved the multiple-accounts problem on Android in 2012. Since Google Home isn't coming out until November, hopefully it'll be solved by then. The Echo's "switch account" command is a little clumsy, true. Ideally, these voice interfaces should be able to tell the difference between the voices of different people in a household, and it would surprise me if that's not possible given the Skynet level of cloud computing going on at both Google and Amazon. And once you have a family set up, there are more interesting things Google Home could do. For instance, I could ask Google Home how many hours my daughter has spent watching Chromecast over the past week, and to tell me when that goes past 10 hours. Or my wife could leave a note for when I get home, that only I could hear. Google Home is going to need some sort of multiple-user function if it's going to be a working intelligent assistant in a family context. Hopefully, it'll come by launch.

But for those in the know, Pennsylvania’s second city is well on its way to establishing itself as the Silicon Valley of the east – and even its roads are helping. Unlike many American cities, Pittsburgh road system is literally off the grid, its origins dating back to twisty, pre-revolution forest trails. Then there are the city’s 446 bridges to navigate. More importantly Pittsburgh boasts the robotics department at Carnegie-Mellon University, recognized as the leading academic institution in the field. Uber’s first self-driving car spotted in Pittsburgh Read more It was here last month that Pittsburgh opened its doors to show the world why it is so well positioned to be a new tech hub. The city is now in a position to capitalize on the infrastructure of the past in ways that could not have been anticipated at the depths of its post-industrial depression two decades ago, when the city’s population was half its industry peak and the unemployment rate was worse than in Detroit. Last week, the city hosted Thrival, a three-day showcase of panel discussions and exhibitions designed to show off the city’s post-industrial charms. From robotics to biotech, performing arts to healthcare, the city’s premier boosters – many locals or returning natives – sought to describe the city’s upswing. The twin keys to the city’s current success, says the festival’s executive producer, Dan Law, are education and medicine – eds and meds – that helped bridge the gap between old industrial Pittsburgh and a new Pittsburgh that’s about innovation and technology. Now, instead of leaving, students from Pittsburgh’s tech university departments have more options to stay. “Eds and meds are the bedrock of the economic transition,” says Law. “UPMC – University of Pittsburgh Medical Center – alone is a $13bn health system and there are dozens of ancillary industries that began to innovate. So young people started to get jobs here and economic growing around the core economic pillars.” Correspondingly, the city’s arts and culture are thriving. “The City of Bridges is in the throes of a full-on nose-to-tail, barrel-aged, small-plates culinary renaissance,” according to Bon Appetit magazine. It rated one Spanish restaurant, Morcilla, the fourth best restaurant in the US. There’s a trendy Ace Hotel that was originally a YMCA and, of course, the Warhol Museum, dedicated to its most famous artist, and the Carnegie Museums of Art. How community-led renovation is helping a rundown Pittsburgh neighbourhood fight crime Read more “At the centre of it all, Pittsburgh is becoming a diversified innovation economy,” say Luke Skurman, founder of Niche.com and one of the founders of Thrill Mill, a not-for-profit organization providing mentorship and collaborative workspace to early-stage startups. “When I graduated Carnegie Mellon and stayed, people thought I was bananas. Now it’s becoming fashionable to do so.” Among the attendees at Thrival were Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian American neuropathologist who was the first to discover and publish findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players, and Jennifer Krusius, general manager at Uber. The transportation firm has about 500 employees in the city’s tech Strip district and plans to start testing as many as 100 Volvo sport utility vehicles on the city’s streets. Many of Uber’s employees were hired directly from Carnegie-Mellon’s computer labs and the state’s approach to the technology – called greenlight governing – effectively encouraged investment in the field. Uber estimates its investment will reach $1bn over the next few years. “It’s not just about self-driving cars,” says Law. “It’s about the future of urban mobility. How do you create smarter and more efficient cities.” Pittsburgh is ideal, he says, “because if you are going to design a car that needs to navigate some of the most complex road networks and systems, you’re not going to get a bigger challenge than here. It’s old, it was planned poorly, it’s built around hills and valleys, and the roads are windy and steep. If it works in Pittsburgh, it can work anywhere.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A self-driving Uber car drives navigates one of Pittsburgh’s many bridges. Photograph: Gene J Puskar/AP The firm is not alone: General Motors, Google – which has centered its engineering facilities here and employs 600 – and Intel have also come to Pittsburgh. While Apple, which employs 500 here, has not stated the reason for its interest, it is known to have already developed a prototype vehicle. But the city’s easy-going regulatory approach and an intelligent workforce is not the only reason Pittsburgh is becoming ground zero for auto-automation, widely regarded as one of the largest untapped economies. Google’s Mike Capsambelis explains the company’s explicit interest in Pittsburgh is machine learning, a sub-field of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. In other words, learning without needing to be explicitly programmed. “It’s uniquely a collaborative place. We tend to work together even when there’s actual competition,” says Capsambelis. Pittsburgh water: expensive, rust-colored, corrosive, and high in lead Read more Rasu Shrestha, chief innovation officer at UPMC, says healthcare is a natural fit for machine learning. Healthcare, he says, is so muchabout billing and book-keeping. “We want to free the data, to empower patients and consumers to take charge of their own data with the right sets of systems,” says Shrestha. “So the question is, how do we do a better job of precision medicine, not just do a better job of billing and documentation? The entrepreneurial knack is not just to create incremental innovation but to change the entire dynamic of healthcare innovation.” Tech companies, including Google, eye healthcare’s copious resources of data – UPMC’s nine petabytes of data is doubling every 18 months – with some envy. And vice versa. Says Shrestha: “Let’s create solutions that leverage machine learning and big-data-type technologies to create products we can then commercialize.” There may also be a natural symbiosis between healthcare advances and tech’s interest in transport. An ageing population suggests more will need assistance in terms of mobility. “There’s a ton of connections and overlap,” says Capsambelis. “A lot of people will still need cars, but there won’t be as many drivers.” The spirit of entrepreneurship suffuses the robotics lab at Carnegie-Mellon. Not only has tech become a major employer of the university’s graduates, but much of the computational power that was once available only to universities or government laboratories is now available to research. “Having machine learning has really changed the way we do research because the things we used to do at the university, companies can do much better because of their access to huge computing power and big data,” says professor of computer science Lenore Blum. But the city and its promoters at Thrival and Thrill Mill are keen to show off the small entrepreneurs along with the grand-scale technology behemoths that are beginning to occupy the same psychic space in the culture that the robber barons Carnegie and Frick did here in the late 19th century. An app for artists to find spaces, for instance, or a machine-learning ECG device for early stroke detection. Another involves cooking recipes for the sight-impaired. They may not or ever be Google or Uber but they are nonetheless imbibing Pittsburgh’s spirit of innovation. “It looks more like a continuum to us,” says Thrill Mill’s Stephan Mueller, “because we all have this fatal love for Pittsburgh and want to do something for it.” More features Topics Pennsylvania Apple Uber Google Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Google Duo to Replace Hangouts as the Main Video-Chatting App for Android Phones GO Google Duo will become a mandatory preinstall for Android Oct 8, 2016 10:40 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  In an email to its partners, Google reportedly announced a significant change to the core GMS package for Android smartphones. Starting December, the tech giant will no longer include Hangouts in the list of applications bundled with new hardware. “Today, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016,” Google stated in the email, according to Android Police. This means that manufacturers will have the option to stop including Google Hangouts on smartphones released in 2017. Users would have to download and install the application from the Play Store if they wish to use it. Google will transform Hangouts into a business communications platform Google intends to replace Hangouts with Duo on the GMS package for Android smartphones and not Allo. Hangouts did offer video-calling options to its users and Google wanted to find a fitting equivalent, in the form of Duo. However, Allo is a much more complex application, with its Google Assistant integration that allows smart replies and lots of other useful features. Allo is currently competing against other popular third-party messaging solutions, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Kik, and LINE. It seems that Google might be trying to transform Hangouts into a business communications platform, so the app will be focusing on the collaborative group productivity market. This means that the app will continue to live on, but it’s unknown for how long. Meanwhile, Google’s Duo continues to gain popularity, as the app surpassed the 10 million downloads mark on the Play Store. It offers an easy way to place video calls, with tools that prevent the app from dropping the call if Wi-Fi or network connectivity is lacking. It also has a very neat Knock Knock feature that shows a video of the caller before picking up. #Google#Duo#Hangouts#Allo#Android subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Allo Developer Lists 7 Most Requested Features, Including SMS Support Google Allo Passes 5 Million Downloads Mark on Android Allo Takes a Step Back on Privacy in Favor of Google Assistant Features Google’s Allo Lets Users Delete Messages from Chat History 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android Ubuntu Touch OTA-14 Slightly Delayed, New Task Manager Gets Fuzzy Background    Google Hangouts logo New Android APKs Navbar Apps APK: Updated November 13th, 17:48 GMT MiXplorer APK: Updated November 13th, 17:46 GMT Periscope APK: Updated November 13th, 17:43 GMT XDA Labs APK: Updated November 13th, 17:38 GMT Game Tools APK: Updated November 13th, 17:35 GMT SoundHound APK: Updated November 13th, 17:33 GMT Microsoft Classroom APK: Updated November 13th, 17:17 GMT Reader comments Samsung Already Capable of Mass Producing Foldable Smartphones but It's Cautious more on: Samsung foldable phone i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are the first smartphones to be “Made by Google.” They may have been manufactured by HTC, but make no mistake, that G on the back is very important. This is a major strategy shift for Google, and one that is long overdue. By taking end-to-end control of software and hardware, Google can elevate Android to the next level, addressing its major shortcomings. It’s a move that shows a willingness to stand toe-to-toe against Apple and shrug off any lingering deference to dominant Android partners like Samsung. How did we get here? When Google started the Open Handset Alliance it was reliant on hardware partners like HTC, LG, Motorola, Samsung, and Sony. It was only through them that Google could position itself on the majority of the world’s smartphones. The Nexus line was never a serious attempt to muscle in on the market. It grew out of a desire to produce a reference device for developers to test on. The marketing muscle and cutting-edge technology that really drove Android adoption came from Google’s partners. All of them had been caught flat-footed by Apple’s iPhone and Google stepped into the software void and allowed them to compete again. It has largely been a mutually beneficial arrangement, but over time, the line between the open ideals of the platform at its conception and Google’s stewardship have grown increasingly blurred. Google has found itself walking a tightrope; trying to persuade partners to follow its advice, but unable to really bare its teeth for fear of them abandoning the platform. For years it looked as though gaining a foothold on devices through the software might be enough for Google, but stepping into hardware is the only way that the company can realize its vision for Android. To fully understand this move we have to consider the platform’s weaknesses. The problems with Android In the early days of Android its competitors bemoaned the complexity of the platform. It lacked the elegant simplicity and accessibility of iOS. Google worked hard to catch up and possibly even surpass its rival. In truth, the two platforms have far more in common today than features that divide them, but the idea that Android is harder to get to grips with has stuck. It’s an idea that has been reinforced by fragmentation — the Achilles heel of Android. androidn_headerMore There is no standardized Android experience because there are so many different versions of the platform out there on so many different handsets. Google never dictated hardware rules and that helped Android to grow quickly. But, while budget devices have propelled the platform into pole position, they’ve also often made for a poor experience. There’s a much bigger gap between a budget Android device and a flagship like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 than there is between the latest iPhone and the S7. Manufacturers desperate to differentiate themselves from the Android competition layered their own software on top of Android. This has muddied the waters further, negatively impacted performance, and led to excessive bloatware with lesser versions of Google’s apps set as defaults on many devices. As the underlying operating system has improved, these manufacturer UIs have grown increasingly superfluous, but what’s worse is that they’ve effectively blocked Google from rolling out important Android security updates when it wants to. There’s a multitude of hardware and software combinations, so updates have to pass through countless manufacturer and carrier hoops before they can reach our phones. Read More This has left consumers adrift without the latest innovations from Mountain View, California. It has also left serious security vulnerabilities unpatched. There’s no way to spin that as a good thing for Android device owners. The Nexus devices addressed some of these problems, but they always felt like half-hearted releases from Google. They weren’t heavily marketed; they flew in the face of carriers; and Google never took full ownership of Nexus phones in the way it is now with the Pixel phones. Complete control Google cannot put the fragmentation genie back in the bottle. It has to try something different. Taking complete control is a gamble, but Google is coming from a position of strength. Parent company, Alphabet, has never been in better health. This isn’t something that happened overnight, either. Google has been building towards this moment. It has worked with many of the world’s best hardware manufacturers. It owned Motorola Mobility for a while. It has also been quietly separating key features from the open Android platform and innovating through its own suite of apps instead. Google is now managing its own distribution and building a supply chain. Former Motorola chief Rick Osterloh was brought in specifically to build a hardware division. Google phones are now being developed in-house and the company intends to manage every facet, eventually designing its own “silicon” (customized processors), according to VP of Engineering Dave Burke in an interview with Bloomberg. More on fragmentation: Android is losing its battle with fragmentation, and you’re paying the price It’s that kind of tight control that has enabled Apple to achieve levels of performance that surpass the basic specs of the iPhone. That’s why the iPhone 7 has trounced Samsung’s latest and greatest in benchmarks and speed tests. The phenomenal success of Apple’s model cannot be denied. It only sold 17.2 percent of the smartphones on the market last year, but it secured 91 percent of the profits, according to Cannacord Genuity. Of course, to get anywhere near that level of success, Google will have to do a lot more than release a fast, expensive smartphone. It has to build the brand and show consumers why Pixel phones are worth paying a premium. The first phones of many The launch of Google’s new Pixel phones has been met with a mixed response. There’s a general perception that they’re too expensive, and they probably are, though that perception is partly because of the budget-priced expectation Google created with earlier releases in the Nexus line. But these phones aren’t supposed to illustrate what can be achieved to other manufacturers, they’re supposed to compete with the latest round of flagships. We’re already seeing predictions of relatively low sales, but it’s not like this is Google’s last throw of the dice. As Google integrates its artificial intelligence bot Assistant, not just into phones, but a whole line of hardware, buying into that ecosystem instead of Apple’s or Amazon’s becomes a more tempting prospect. The supply chain will solidify, the marriage of software and hardware will grow closer, and Google will continue to pour the lion’s share of its innovative goodies into Pixel phones that will surely get better and better. Hands on: Google guns for the big boys with the spec-stacked Pixel We’ve seen what Google can do with software. Android is the world’s most popular mobile operating system by far, with an 87.6 percent share of the worldwide market, according to IDC. But it didn’t conquer the world overnight. Given time, there’s no telling what Google might do with hardware. This is a smart step for Android to take. It’s a necessary step, but let’s remember that it’s also the first step.

Chennai 2 Singapore Ghibran Ghibran's audio drive V Geetanath » B Rishikesh Bahadurdesai » Zahid Rafiq » TOPICS cinema Indian cinema Tamil cinema soundtrack & audio “A random, crazy idea has been successfully executed,” says composer M. Ghibran, who is back in Chennai after driving from Chennai to Singapore, across six countries by road. In each country, he released one song from his album for Chennai 2 Singapore. He talks to Chitradeepa Anantharam about the journey, the experiences gained and the lessons learnt. How did you land upon this audio drive idea? I always Google the title of my films. When I typed Chennai to Singapore, I got not only flight details, but a Google map that displayed the road route. This gave me the idea for an audio drive. Why not release the audio along this route, on an audio drive? But when I discussed this idea with my friend and the director of the film, Abbas Akbar, we dismissed it as a stupid thought. What made you take up the audio drive finally? Audio-release functions were becoming boring and monotonous. Kamal Haasan broke the tradition by releasing Uttama Villain’s audio on an app. He inspired me to think out of the box. I thought an audio drive would garner attention. We left on August 12 (coincidentally, my birthday) and returned on September 12. My team comprised of Abbas Akbar (director), Karthick Nallamuthu (cinematographer), Shiv Keshav (media manager in charge of social-media updates about the trip) and my assistant Aravind, who drove almost 80 per cent of the distance. What was the route and how did you prepare yourself? We left Chennai and drove to Vijayawada, Kolkata, Guwahati, Assam, Nagaland and then to Manipur. From there, we proceeded to Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and finally, Singapore. Fans on social media gave us tips and suggestions. I was also working on other projects during the drive, so in the car I had a sort of a mini studio, with battery back-up. We were prepared for various things, but not for earthquakes, landslides and last-minute document cancellation. Any unforgettable experiences? When you look at our videos, one will get the impression that it was just a fun-filled road trip. But, in reality, we faced a lot of legal issues. When we stopped for tea upon reaching Manipur, an earthquake struck. It was followed by another. We were stranded for 10 days without communication. Our families panicked, and especially Karthick’s wife, who was in the eighth month of her pregnancy. When the third tremor of a magnitude of 7.4 occurred, we almost decided to return to Chennai. But the support and encouragement that poured in on social media made us proceed. Those were emotional moments for me and my team. You also mentioned a landslide… When we were about to enter Myanmar, a major landslide delayed our entry into the country. And to top it, our documents were declared invalid, as the country had recently changed its policy. So we had to reapply. The next major hurdle was in Thailand, where the government had imposed a new rule for travellers entering by road. We were expected to get an assurance letter from the local Land Transport Corporation. The border officials seized our vehicle but let the team enter the country. We hired a car and went to Bangkok to meet the officials, who sought an assurance letter from the Indian embassy. But we got zero help from them. Finally, the Singapore embassy issued the assurance letter, and we crossed Thailand. How did it feel when you reached Singapore to a rousing reception? It was a mixed feeling, a sense of achievement. We all are still in the hangover of the trip. It’s a great feeling. Ghibran’s drive diary August 12: Chennai. Song: Vaadi vaadi. Theme: A formula dream song in the Western genre. A relaxed, feel good song. August 19: Bhutan Song: Poda Poda. Theme: Life throws a lot of challenges, and we look at life and say, Poda. This is a rap number, a tongue twister, rendered beautifully by RJ Balaji. This is his first full-length song.. September 2: Myanmar Song: Pogathe. Theme: A sad number. September 7: Thailand Song: Texas Pogiren. Theme: A wacky number. The idea is to make people to react in different ways. September 10: Malaysia: Song: Gun Inbam.

Tech on the screen With James Cameron aspiring for his Avatar sequels to be screened in glass-less 3-D, can we expect its technology to be the next big thing in cinema? Yes we can. This sort of an upgrade is sure to draw more people back to theatres. It won’t. Most people prefer watching films on 2-D. Surely. A lot of people don’t like wearing 3-D glasses as they are clumsy and expensive. No. It will just be another excuse to charge more for tickets.

The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are the first smartphones to be “Made by Google.” They may have been manufactured by HTC, but make no mistake, that G on the back is very important. This is a major strategy shift for Google, and one that is long overdue. By taking end-to-end control of software and hardware, Google can elevate Android to the next level, addressing its major shortcomings. It’s a move that shows a willingness to stand toe-to-toe against Apple and shrug off any lingering deference to dominant Android partners like Samsung. How did we get here? When Google started the Open Handset Alliance it was reliant on hardware partners like HTC, LG, Motorola, Samsung, and Sony. It was only through them that Google could position itself on the majority of the world’s smartphones. The Nexus line was never a serious attempt to muscle in on the market. It grew out of a desire to produce a reference device for developers to test on. Google never took full ownership of Nexus phones in the way it is now with the Pixel phones. The marketing muscle and cutting-edge technology that really drove Android adoption came from Google’s partners. All of them had been caught flat-footed by Apple’s iPhone and Google stepped into the software void and allowed them to compete again. It has largely been a mutually beneficial arrangement, but over time, the line between the open ideals of the platform at its conception and Google’s stewardship have grown increasingly blurred. Google has found itself walking a tightrope; trying to persuade partners to follow its advice, but unable to really bare its teeth for fear of them abandoning the platform. For years it looked as though gaining a foothold on devices through the software might be enough for Google, but stepping into hardware is the only way that the company can realize its vision for Android. To fully understand this move we have to consider the platform’s weaknesses. The problems with Android In the early days of Android its competitors bemoaned the complexity of the platform. It lacked the elegant simplicity and accessibility of iOS. Google worked hard to catch up and possibly even surpass its rival. In truth, the two platforms have far more in common today than features that divide them, but the idea that Android is harder to get to grips with has stuck. It’s an idea that has been reinforced by fragmentation — the Achilles heel of Android. There is no standardized Android experience because there are so many different versions of the platform out there on so many different handsets. Google never dictated hardware rules and that helped Android to grow quickly. But, while budget devices have propelled the platform into pole position, they’ve also often made for a poor experience. There’s a much bigger gap between a budget Android device and a flagship like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 than there is between the latest iPhone and the S7. Manufacturers desperate to differentiate themselves from the Android competition layered their own software on top of Android. This has muddied the waters further, negatively impacted performance, and led to excessive bloatware with lesser versions of Google’s apps set as defaults on many devices. As the underlying operating system has improved, these manufacturer UIs have grown increasingly superfluous, but what’s worse is that they’ve effectively blocked Google from rolling out important Android security updates when it wants to. There’s a multitude of hardware and software combinations, so updates have to pass through countless manufacturer and carrier hoops before they can reach our phones. This has left consumers adrift without the latest innovations from Mountain View, California. It has also left serious security vulnerabilities unpatched. There’s no way to spin that as a good thing for Android device owners. The Nexus devices addressed some of these problems, but they always felt like half-hearted releases from Google. They weren’t heavily marketed; they flew in the face of carriers; and Google never took full ownership of Nexus phones in the way it is now with the Pixel phones. Complete control Google cannot put the fragmentation genie back in the bottle. It has to try something different. Taking complete control is a gamble, but Google is coming from a position of strength. Parent company, Alphabet, has never been in better health. Given time, there’s no telling what Google might do with hardware. This isn’t something that happened overnight, either. Google has been building towards this moment. It has worked with many of the world’s best hardware manufacturers. It owned Motorola Mobility for a while. It has also been quietly separating key features from the open Android platform and innovating through its own suite of apps instead. Google is now managing its own distribution and building a supply chain. Former Motorola chief Rick Osterloh was brought in specifically to build a hardware division. Google phones are now being developed in-house and the company intends to manage every facet, eventually designing its own “silicon” (customized processors), according to VP of Engineering Dave Burke in an interview with Bloomberg. More on fragmentation: Android is losing its battle with fragmentation, and you’re paying the price It’s that kind of tight control that has enabled Apple to achieve levels of performance that surpass the basic specs of the iPhone. That’s why the iPhone 7 has trounced Samsung’s latest and greatest in benchmarks and speed tests. The phenomenal success of Apple’s model cannot be denied. It only sold 17.2 percent of the smartphones on the market last year, but it secured 91 percent of the profits, according to Cannacord Genuity. Of course, to get anywhere near that level of success, Google will have to do a lot more than release a fast, expensive smartphone. It has to build the brand and show consumers why Pixel phones are worth paying a premium. The first phones of many The launch of Google’s new Pixel phones has been met with a mixed response. There’s a general perception that they’re too expensive, and they probably are, though that perception is partly because of the budget-priced expectation Google created with earlier releases in the Nexus line. But these phones aren’t supposed to illustrate what can be achieved to other manufacturers, they’re supposed to compete with the latest round of flagships. We’re already seeing predictions of relatively low sales, but it’s not like this is Google’s last throw of the dice. As Google integrates its artificial intelligence bot Assistant, not just into phones, but a whole line of hardware, buying into that ecosystem instead of Apple’s or Amazon’s becomes a more tempting prospect. The supply chain will solidify, the marriage of software and hardware will grow closer, and Google will continue to pour the lion’s share of its innovative goodies into Pixel phones that will surely get better and better. Hands on: Google guns for the big boys with the spec-stacked Pixel We’ve seen what Google can do with software. Android is the world’s most popular mobile operating system by far, with an 87.6 percent share of the worldwide market, according to IDC. But it didn’t conquer the world overnight. Given time, there’s no telling what Google might do with hardware. This is a smart step for Android to take. It’s a necessary step, but let’s remember that it’s also the first step.

Fox's animated series is offering fans a special immersive experience to celebrate its 600th episode on Sunday, October 16. The famous couch gag will be available to view in virtual reality for anyone equipped with the relevant Google gadgetry. America's longest-running primetime scripted TV series, "The Simpsons" has a very special episode in store for viewers on October 16. "Treehouse of Horror XXVII" is not only a Halloween special -- an annual tradition for the show since 1990 -- but is also the first ever episode to offer a virtual reality experience. This 360° VR experience will take viewers into the world of the famous yellow family, but not for an entire episode. It is, in fact, the famous "couch gag" that has faithfully opened each episode of "The Simpsons" for 28 seasons that's due for VR treatment. The gag, dubbed "Planet of the Couches," was already animated but never used, and was hanging around at Fox waiting for its moment to screen. TV viewers will see the 45-second opening ritual in its usual form. However, a three-minute virtual reality version has been specially designed for the occasion. At one point, viewers will see Homer, Marge and their kids in a prison cell and be able to explore the scene from six different angles. To enjoy the VR experience, fans will need the Google Spotlight Stories application, available for Android and iOS, and a Google Cardboard VR viewer for use with a smartphone. Selling for $15, Google's VR viewer is compatible with most Android and Apple smartphones. Google has even created a limited-edition yellow model for the event, finished with various Simpsons characters. Fans can sign up for one of the 25,000 free special-edition Cardboard viewers here: Knoxlabs.com/products/thesimpsons. "The Simpsons" made its debut in 1989 on the Fox network, which began airing the show's 28th season on September 25, 2016.

If you look at any relationship objectively, you'll see it goes through stages. Five stages test how real, deep and loyal the love between two individuals is. In most cases, if couples aren’t happy, they don’t reach beyond the third stage. However, if they let go off their ego and follow the forgive and forget route, there are full-fledged chances of a long-lasting relationship. Here are five stages of love and the ideal ways to overcome each. 1. Falling in love Image Credit: unsplash You feel as if you’re floating in the clouds. You feel like listening to Yashraj songs on loop. You feel like smiling for no reason. Falling in love is a phase to be cherished forever. It is this phase that makes us realise how capable we are of giving. You don’t need to make any effort to fall in love - it happens slowly at first and then all at once. 2. Coupling Image Credit: unsplash Here, you confess your love for each other and become a couple. Or one of you pops the question and goes ahead without fearing rejection. As you're aware, there could be two situations here - yes or no. If it's a no, you will have to accept that the other person doesn’t feel the same way as you do, and move on. If yes, then it’s a great feeling of love being reciprocated.  The only way to cross this stage is by initiation. It is when you express your true feelings for a person, that you move forward. You start with movies and lunch dates and end being comfortable with physical intimacy. By now, you probably know what your partner likes and dislikes. You’re in love and it shows. Everything is perfect, and everything is rosy.  3. Disillusionment Image Credit: unsplash Until you reach the third stage. By now, reality starts creeping in. It hits you hard. ‘Oh why do you always make sounds while eating?', ‘Why do you always have to keep a check on me?’, ‘Why do you always think I am looking at other girls?’. Fights like these start to occur in the third stage and it’s now suddenly a bed of thorns. At this stage, couples who are not sure about the future stop seeing each other and discontinue their relationship. Stronger couples successfully cross the third hurdle. It is this stage in a relationship where the couple’s patience and their love for each other is put through test. This hurdle can be crossed with love, trust and lots of patience. For instance, it’s necessary to forgive and forget after every fight. With understanding and mutual respect, disillusionment can be put behind. 4. Working on creating long-lasting love Image Credit: unsplash Once the third stage is behind, couples have to pour in more love, trust and respect to nurture the relationship, which then becomes unbreakable. By this stage, you have accepted your partner’s shortcomings and now look beyond their anger and tantrums. You are so close to each other that the thought of separation doesn’t even cross your mind. However, both of you have to work hard to keep the spark alive. Whether it's their birthday or an exciting trip they are going on, you’ve got to be psyched and you’ve got to be excited. 5. Taking over the world together Image Credit: unsplash It’s not you vs the world. Since you no longer have any doubts and qualms about your partner, you can now concentrate on doing things together to change the world. You are a team and can do anything, whether it's being the best couple, doing philanthropy or setting an example in perfect parenting. You’ve got to be a strong team and influence others to be the same.  973 facebook twitter reddit Comment Here ADVERTISEMENT Follow @indiatimes Next on Indiatimes Lifestyle: Anyone For 'LoC Pizza'?

Google already started seeding Android 7.0 Nougat to their Nexus smartphones including the two year's old Nexus 6. However, the power-packed Nexus 5 was left out from the list of supported devices. Now, the real concern for many smartphone owners right now is that Is their smartphone eligible for Android 7.0 Nougat update'?

Moto G (4th Gen), Moto G Plus (4th Gen), Moto G Play (4th Gen), Moto X Pure Edition (3rd Gen), Moto X Style, Moto X Play, Moto X Force, Droid Turbo 2, Droid Maxx 2, Moto Z, Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Force Droid, Moto Z Play, Moto Z Play Droid, Nexus 6. Do make a note that, there is no Moto E3 Power in this list, which means that the smartphone may not receive the update.   Samsung It is widely expected that almost all the 2015 and 2016 Samsung smartphones will be updated to Android 7.0 Nougat. The list includes Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, and the struggling Galaxy Note 7.

The Echo will soon face competition from Google and Apple. (Mark Lennihan/Associated Press) FILE - This Wednesday, March 2, 2016, file photo shows an Echo Dot, left, and an Amazon Tap in San Francisco. The Amazon Echo, which listens to you, answers questions and carries out tasks like calling an Uber or turning on your lights, is finding a place in millions of living rooms. The Dot and the portable Tap give the Echo's Alexa software even broader reach. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) By MAE ANDERSON, Associated Press Published: October 7, 2016, 11:37 PM A   A NEW YORK — Does your home really need a “smart speaker” to answer questions, call you an Uber, turn off the lights or play music when you ask? You may be about to find out. Two years ago, Amazon introduced the Amazon Echo, an unassuming, $180 cylinder that sits on a kitchen counter or bookshelf, acting as a personal assistant that listens to you and does your bidding. Initially, the point of gadget was a little difficult to discern. But Echo and its Alexa voice recognition software have since become a sleeper hit, with an estimated 3 million gadgets sold as of April, according to research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Home ‘smart’ Now the Echo is getting some company. On Tuesday, Google announced a similar smart speaker called Google Home, which will be available in November for $129. It will perform many of the same tasks as Echo, including playing music and fielding questions plus controlling compatible lights and appliances. The Google Assistant that works with Home will also be able to access your calendar, Google Maps and other services if you allow. Apple has opened up its Siri personal assistant so third-party developers can create new features for it, much as Amazon has done with its Alexa software. Google Assistant is also opening up to outside apps in December. Sony is working on Xperia Agent, a digital assistant that connects to devices in the home. All these companies are chasing the smart-home market, which could grow to be a $71 billion global industry by 2018, up from $33 billion in 2013 and $25 billion in 2012, according to Juniper Research. That’s growing fast, although it’s still much smaller than the smartphone market, which the research firm IDC valued at about $412 billion in 2015. But while the Echo carved out an early success, it remains to be seen whether voice-recognition smart speakers will truly break into the mainstream. “They’re early, (but) the market is early, and we have a long way to go,” said David Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner. Learning new skills One key to the Echo’s success was Amazon’s willingness to work with third-party developers, allowing it to add new functions each week, making it easy for owners of the speaker to discover new ways to use it. (It launched with a few dozen “skills” and now has thousands). “Initially we got it for music,” said Brian Bishop, a business analyst in Tomball, Texas, whose family uses two Echos. “Later, when it controlled the lights and fans and outlets, that just made it even better.” Interest in smart homes appears to be rising as more people become enamored of their smartphones. A recent online survey of more than 4,600 adults in the U.S. by Forrester Research’s Technographics found 57 percent of them either had used or were interested in using a smart home device such as remote control lights or thermostats. The Echo’s hands-free operation filled an undiscovered niche in the smart-home universe. Users can just say the wake word “Alexa” and direct it to do a task like turn on lights or set a timer. Since you don’t need to use a smartphone or tablet, that sets it apart from other smart home systems like those offered by Samsung or Apple. Speak to me People seem to have an easier time talking to a speaker that has no other interface than they do talking to a smartphone. “I’ve never used Cortana. I don’t use Google and my wife doesn’t use Siri, but everybody talks to Alexa,” Bishop said. “I couldn’t really tell you why. That was the only way to communicate, so we all got in the habit.” Buck Wise, a Portland advertising executive, tried several variants of smart home systems, but said the Echo worked best for him because of the hands-free speaker. He has lights, blinds, and his garage door synced with the Echo. “Alexa truly is the brain of our home and it would feel like 100 steps backwards to get through a day without her,” Wise said. What won him over? Commanding the device just by speaking — and without having to fire up an app — basically did the trick, he said. Big ambitions Google has catching up to do. Amazon first hinted at its Echo ambitions in a Super Bowl ad featuring Alec Baldwin and seen by more than 100 million people. Beginning in April, the Echo went on sale at retail outlets including Best Buy, Home Depot, electronics stores such as RadioShack and others. The same month, Amazon opened up its smart home capabilities to let all developers of smart home functions integrate with Alexa. It’s also launched two other Echo-like devices, the smaller $50 Dot — which it now sells in six-packs so people can have one in every room — and the portable $100 Tap, to give Alexa even broader reach. Dave Limp, Amazon’s senior vice president for devices, says the goal is for Alexa to keep getting smarter as it continues to build new “skills” over the coming years. “The hope is you can ask Alexa anything and it will be able to respond correctly, quickly and be able to be there,” he said.

Well, many marketers are still looking for the right washer/dryer combo for cleaning those clothes. Just like a super appliance store can be full of washers and dryers, the marketplace is full of different tools for combining data, from Microsoft BI to dashboard solutions like Tableau. Google has offered its own data appliance in the form of Data Studio. The solution was first introduced as part of the Google Analytics 360 Suite, the premium version of Google Analytics aimed at enterprise-level reporting needs. But Google decided to introduce a beta version to complement not only its standard analytics solution but for other purposes. The result is now another appliance that offers a central repository for data and report-building. Data Studio offers the ability to combine data from many sources, including AdWords, Google Analytics, Big Query, and Google Sheets. There's provision for SQL database sources as well.  How Data Studio Works  Once logged in, you are taken to a home page that has a layout familiar from other Google services. This means a user experience with large, tablet-friendly selectors and menus that group features by function. There is also a video help selection, to allow you to see how features work via YouTube. If you are ready to start, begin with the Reports and Data Sources selectors in the upper left-hand corner. The Reports selector permits you to create reports and data visualizations. Sample reports are presented immediately in the home page so you can see the range of ideas that you can have for reports. You can copy a demo report, or create your own. The Data Sources selector is meant, obviously, to add the data sources. Once selected, data appears as a schema table on the home page. Like Reports, there are also sample schemata that serve as a guidance for ideas, such as this Adwords example. You can then confirm that you want to add the schema to a report and select the visualization that you want. Visualization choices appear on a bar at the top of the page. Source, dimension, metric, and appearance style appear on the right, allowing adjustments, such as changing a chart scale. Most of the visualization has a drag and drop feel, and can be adjusted as needed. How Data Studios Benefits Data Mining Marketers Data Studio is meant to address a growing complaint among data-savvy analysts who have to offer guidance to time-crunched managers; namely, that the majority of their time is spent on data management tasks rather than analysis. It's a refrain that has worn out its welcome, particularly with the advent of data mining. Through tools like Data Studio, managers are discovering real business value from blending data from different sources and improving reporting plans. Data mining activities foreshadow a wide variety of model creation, ranging from regression to machine learning, thus shifting time available towards analysis rather than setup. To provide that resource shift, Data Studio treats its data sources as reusable components. Users can reuse connections in various reports, and in different combinations within the same page. The sources do not have to be hardcoded in visualization, making maintenance updates easier and quicker. Reusable code is a central concept to R programming. Reusability allows R programmers to recreate models fasters, and allow other programmers to verify models through duplicate the process in creating those results. Verification is a key tenet data mining, and scientific research generally. With Data Studio, enterprises can experiment with how to best use the data available alongside familiar tools. A number of solutions can export data into Google Sheets, and Data Studio Product Manager Nikhil Roy has said that Data Studio was intended as a complement to Google Sheets. Whether data mining or developing dashboards, marketers need to quickly share information with other teams. The ease of doing so has been enhanced with Google Data Studio. Loading links....

Google Duo is taking Hangouts’ place on Android The Verge 10/8/2016 Nick Statt © Provided by The Verge In its ongoing effort to push new chat software, Google won't require Android phone makers to preload the Hangouts app as part of its core mobile app suite starting December 1st, according to Android Police. In its place, the company will instead include Duo, its recently released FaceTime competitor for instant video chatting. Hangouts isn't totally going away. It will remain an optional member of the Google Mobile Services package, which Google requires manufacturers to install so consumers have integral services like the Chrome browser and Google Maps. However, the demotion means Hangouts will have significantly less visibility among new phone buyers if companies do decide to leave it out. This does not mean manufacturers will decide to leave Hangouts wallowing in the Play Store. The app could very well make its way onto Android handsets for many months to come. And the app will be available for download even if it is left out of the GMS suite — that is until Google decides to shutter it. Still, the move is a telling one from the search giant, which has moved aggressively to promote Duo and its new artificial intelligence-powered chat app Allo. It's a bit of a strange move that Allo won't be a mandatory app in the GMS suite, as Android Police points out, but it could be included down the line. Right now, it's clear Google wants to promote video chatting above all else.

Watch: Google Pixel XL First Look Video Google’s launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency.

He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Also Read: Google Pixel, Pixel XL First Impressions: Google’s new smartphones are here Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a US exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone’s Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple’s ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. “When you have an inferior brand, it’s OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you,” he said. “But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice.” Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPM Modi holds meeting with senior ministers on demonetisation process BusinessWhat jammed the ATM: Secrecy and no Plan B IndiaBear pain for 50 days, then punish me: PM Modi on demonetisation IndiaCollegium lists 7 High Court chief justices for elevation to Supreme Court Board exams today, hope, fear in Valley: ‘Can’t lose year’ EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentPadmavati will be extremely difficult, says Deepika Padukone EntertainmentSalman Khan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan praise PM Modi on demonetisation EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show Must Read SportsDraw for India, a moral victory for England SportsDid India miss a trick by rolling out a true track?
