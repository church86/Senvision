Cr Moore said the unused swing bridge over Rozelle Bay, which has been closed since 1995, was among a list of short-term transport options the government had failed to deliver in its bid to convert the Bays Precinct at Rozelle into a technology hub.

In a major blow to the government's plans, Google cited the timing for transport infrastructure upgrades as one of the main reasons for abandoning negotiations to shift its operations from Pyrmont to a repurposed White Bay power station. The lord mayor accused the government of being fixated with motorways, namely WestConnex, which she said had "tied up" the government's transport budget and would "dump tens of thousands of cars into Rozelle and choke Victoria Road to the point that buses can't service the area". Related Content Google pulls out of Bays Precinct The inner Sydney developments to be prioritised by Premier "The government's fixation with motorways and metro rail is blinding it to solutions that would service our community today and into the future, and in many cases without the huge price tags," she said. Adding to the criticism on Wednesday, state Opposition Leader Luke Foley said Google's decision had left the government's plans for a technology hub in the inner west in a "smouldering wreck" and Sydney a "global laughing stock." Advertisement He said Labor had called for the Glebe Island bridge to be re-opened 18 months ago "as a first-step solution". Former Leichardt mayor Darcy Byrne said he had repeatedly lobbied the government to reopen the bridge in order to make White Bay a "10- or 15-minute stroll from the CBD".

The bridge has been permanently in the "open" position for the past decade. Photo: Peter Rae Their comments came as Transport Minister Andrew Constance responded on Wednesday to Google's decision, signalling the government would consider fast tracking the so-called Sydney Metro West rail project, which will include a new train station at the Bays Precinct. "Of course, if I can. I made it clear, if you look at the T1 Western Line by 2031, you can't get people onto trains," he said. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link An artist's impression of the redeveloped White Bay Power Station. Photo: Supplied "So there has got to be another transport solution and that's why we are working through these projects and trying to get them away." But Mr Foley accused the Berejiklian government of placing "on the backburner" the long-term solution of a new train station at the Bays Precinct, in favour of improving transport in the Liberal heartland suburbs. "Instead, the Premier's priorities are a $10 billion tunnel under the north shore and the eastern suburbs white elephant light rail vanity project." Cr Moore said re-opening the Glebe Island bridge would immediately improve access to the area by allowing "shuttle bus connections to the existing light rail, and provide a useful bike and walking connection". Another option was building a "high-frequency ferry service from White Bay to Barangaroo", which she said would build on the "hundreds of millions of dollars already invested in the Barangaroo transport interchange, with Wynyard Walk and the Wynyard Station upgrades". The government committed in November to building the $10 billion Sydney Metro West line, which will run between Sydney's central business district and Parramatta, announcing construction would begin within five years. In the meantime, Mr Constance said there was the opportunity to improve ferry and bus services to the Bays Precinct as an interim measure. But he cautioned that he "can't click my fingers and just put major transport infrastructure in there", highlighting that the government had construction under way on major projects such as a $2.1 billion light rail line. And he accused Labor leader Luke Foley of opposing the financing of "every piece of infrastructure" and attacking projects such as the light rail from the CBD to Randwick and Kensington in Sydney's south east.

By Allan Kiuna | Wednesday, Apr 12th 2017 at 08:21 Share this story: Share on Facebook Tweet Google Plus Linkedin Comments The compelling story of the most popular search engine on the internet, Google, is somewhat a very encouraging journey. In the words of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders, they began in 1995 at Stanford University. Larry was considering Stanford for grad school and Sergey, a student there, was assigned to show him around. By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following year, they struck a partnership. Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of individual pages on the World Wide Web. They soon renamed it, from Backrub to Google, and the rest is history. Their mission was simple: “To organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” Just a few years ago, these two amazing guys decided to begin something that has now become a global phenomenon; valued at over U$ 527 billion. Today, with more than 50,000 employees in 50 different countries, Google makes hundreds of products used by billions of people across the globe, from YouTube and Android to Smartbox and, of course, Google Search. Their passion for building technology for everyone has stayed with them to date — from the dorm room, to the garage, to the googleplex! Because they began, they now are among the world’s great! I believe that when a man downloads purpose from God, and begins the journey of fulfilling it, it is no longer a man doing what a man gotta do, it is God working in a man to achieve not mere earthly performance and results, but extraordinary outcomes. Purpose is what God wants to do on earth — but God only works on earth through men and women.  Purpose is divine thoughts in the mind of a person, expressing God’s thoughts about what He wants achieved on earth! That is why truly successful people are not just using their natural effort to succeed – something more powerful than them seems to be driving them forward and backing them up. And more often than not, vision is the unfolding of the journey as it already exists in ours heart and as laid there by God. People fail to kick-start their dreams because they want to begin adult dreams — yet all dreams are began at toddler stage. With the proper motives and accurate passion, there is nothing that is impossible to achieve. The willingness to begin our dreams no matter the prevailing circumstances is what prequalifies us to succeed. And the ability to accept that you cannot fly before you crawl is the difference between go-getters and non-starters. We need to understand that at the baby stage, every focus, attention and effort must be given to the baby until weaning is done and self-reasoning established. Success is created when you become obsessed with your purpose and begin the journey to destiny. See also: Only discipline will fire you to success Do not despise the days of your humble beginning. That’s means more often than not, beginnings are humble. This is where a majority of people get disqualified – because they expect the beginning to be great! I love small beginnings. I love to work in silence and out of sight. In fact, one of the best character traits you can inculcate into your principles is to work without recognition. Most people fail to begin because the comfort of predictable living has become threatened by the unknown world of faith. We have to start even though the triumphs of our purpose sound melodious but the perils smell lethal. You may not see the entire path; the twists and the turns, the bends and the roundabouts, but declare your journey before you begin it. The journey you haven’t defined is just a walk. And attempting to go everywhere is going nowhere. At the end of the day, you will be remembered for your obsession. Your willingness, and not your perfection is what qualifies you to grow in purpose. Impossible is only what has not been started. In fact, impossible is nothing and nothing is impossible. Change the traditional perspective you have become accustomed to. See yourself in the light of the overcoming power of God. See yourself not as a mere hand-to-mouth entity but an enterprise capable and able to feed nations. Don’t see your dream as a job for one person but as a livelihood for entire communities. The only thing that stands between you and greatness is your fear of starting. Don’t Begin so you can quit, begin to finish and finish strong! You may start in a dormitory, or a garage but that does not mean you will not end up with mega dreams!         Do you have something to add to this story? Comment here.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Computers Google's Autodraw AI instantly converts your doodles to clip art Rich Haridy April 11, 2017 Google's Autodraw is a free web-based app that uses machine learning to identify what you're trying to scribble and replaces it with recognizable images (Credit: Google Autodraw) View gallery - 7 images The latest innovation from Google's AI Experiments program is Autodraw. The system builds off a machine-learning tool previously developed called Quickdraw, which used a neural network to try and guess what object you are trying to draw as you draw it. Autodraw takes things a step further to let you doodle and get decent results on your phone. Google's AI Experiments has been slowly dropping fascinating artistic or creative uses of its neural net for some time now. Acting as an open-source resource offering code and tutorials to anyone with a creative idea, the program has generated experiments involving everything from object-recognition machine-learning to a system that lets you play a live piano duet with a computer. Sick of Ads? More than 700 New Atlas Plus subscribers read our newsletter and website without ads. Join them for just US$19 a year.More Information With Autodraw, as you doodle on the web-based sketch pad the system constantly offers you a series of simple clip art images based on what it thinks you're trying to create. After a few tests with our terribly juvenile squiggles it seems the system works surprisingly well. Getting a bit abstract now (Credit: Google Autodraw) It's a dolphin! (Credit: Google Autodraw) A couple of circles with a square on top was quickly recognized as an attempt at trying to draw a car and a hastily sketched trio of circles swiftly became a butterfly thanks to the clever neural network. The only blackspot we discovered was the machine's inability, or unwillingness, to recognize our immature doodles of doodles. We assume the AI is above schoolyard humor. The clip art imagery the system suggests is obviously quite generic, but as a demonstration of machine learning and the ability to recognize objects from abstract doodles, it all works rather well. Google is supplying the web-based app for free and it's available on everything from smartphones to tablets and desktops, making this a useful quick design platform to whip up that Facebook event flyer or, if you're like us, just to help turn those terrible doodles into something people can comprehend.

Later, Microsoft entered the game with its own version of an intelligent personal assistant - Cortana and last year Google went full throttle with its AI-powered Google Assistant which was initially only available to Pixel devices.    Samsung seems to have relied heavily on its new personal assistant Bixby, so much so that the South Korean giant actually gave a dedicated button on the side, for the personal assistant. Unlike Cortana or Google Assistant, Bixby is deeply engraved to both software and hardware which is why Samsung was bullish about it at the time of the unveiling of Galaxy S8.

Benedict Brooknews.com.au@BenedictBrook Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend DON’T be surprised if the NSW Government switches its web browsing to Bing, after Google put a hole at the heart of ambitious regeneration plans for Sydney’s CBD fringe. One of the world’s largest tech companies, Google was the headline tenant of a multi-billion redevelopment project on an industrial Sydney Harbour backwater dubbed the Bays Precinct. The Government’s development arm, UrbanGrowth NSW, had hailed the development as “a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver innovation and attract jobs, reinforcing [Sydney’s] reputation as an internationally-competitive, resilient and prosperous global city to live, work and visit”. But that vision may have to wait with Google now saying sayonara to the Sydney Harbour site. The company insisted it had not reneged on a commitment to move its Australian headquarters to the former White Bay Power Station which currently lies derelict at the heart of the precinct. A spokesman told news.com.au there was never a deal and it only ever held “exploratory negotiations” about the possibility of moving into the building’s shell. However firm — or not — Google’s commitment may have been, it’s volte face has now raised doubts about the entire project. Google was to have been the tenant of the redeveloped White Bay Power Station, seen in this image.Source:Supplied An urban planning expert has told news.com.au Google’s withdrawal is a “huge blow” for the Bays Precinct project. The opposition said the project had “fallen apart” due to bad planning by the Government. Dubbed ‘Silicon Harbour’, the Bays Precinct would have seen 5.5 kilometres of harbour front, and 95 hectares of mostly government-owned land, turned into a hub for technology firms and start-ups. On Wednesday, a statement from UrbanGrowth NSW said it had come to a “mutual agreement” with Google Australia to abandon plans move into the power station. “Both parties have been through a collaborative, respectful and comprehensive process to determine a range of options for the site.” White Bay Power Station is currently derelict. Picture: Toby ZernaSource:News Corp Australia A Google spokesman thanked “the NSW Government and Urban Growth NSW for their efforts to deliver on their impressive vision for White Bay Power Station”. It wasn’t impressive enough, though, with the company now looking for “an alternative long-term home in Sydney”. “We remain committed to Australia, to supporting innovation in Sydney and across the country,” the spokesman said. The Government said it was holding firm on the precinct being a future technology and innovation hub. “Given the iconic nature of White Bay Power Station and its significance to Sydney, UrbanGrowth NSW will continue with its methodical and considered approach to the power station’s redevelopment.” Fairfax reported that a lack of transport links was a key factor in Google walking away from White Bay. While the planned Sydney Metro West underground line does include a stop at the Bays Precinct, it is way down the list of priorities with a new rail link in the city’s north west under construction and a second line to the south west the next cab off the rank. Speaking to news.com.au, Tarsha Finney, an expert on architecture and urbanism at UTS, said good transport links to big development sites was “undeniably and absolutely essential,” and with those links a decade or more away Google may have chosen to base themselves somewhere more connected. Aerial view of the Bays Precinct which the NSW Government wants to become a tech hub.Source:Supplied The loss of a high profile tenant such as Google was a “huge blow,” said Peter Bishop, a professor of urban design at University College London who is visiting Sydney. “You won’t get big people coming in without the infrastructure. It’s enormously difficult to refit the power station without an anchor tenant and it might mean rethinking what the strategy is.” UrbanGrowth NSW are now faced with finding a large new organisation to fund the expensive conversion of the old power station, close to Balmain, or look at converting it at huge cost and hoping smaller tech companies will take up the space. “No one knows what to do with these closed down iconic redundant pieces of infrastructure,” said Ms Finney. “The Tate Modern art gallery [housed in an old London power station] has worked but there’s only so much cultural programming you can use to fill those enormous spaces.” Artist's impression of a redeveloped White Bay Power Station which Google was to move into. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied UrbanGrowth NSW’s head Barry Mann played down Google’s pull out saying “I don’t think it’s a massive drama, it’s a really long-term project, it’s going to take 20 to 30 years across the entire Bays Precinct ... and we’re only three years in.” But Opposition leader Luke Foley has slammed the Government’s entire plan for White Bay. “It’s all fallen apart because the Government has only had a plan for the area for more and more high-rise apartments,” Mr Foley told ABC. “You won’t get companies like Google and their talented mobile workforce to relocate to a precinct unless that precinct has public transport, accessibility and open space” NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian spruiked another infrastructure project on Wednesday announcing the Land and Property Information’s titling and registry services has been leased for $2.6 billion. The Australian Registry Investments consortium, that includes Australian institutional investors, First State Super and Hastings Funds Management as well as 20 per cent stake from the UK’s part nationalised Royal Bank of Scotland Group won the tender. Ms Berejiklian said $1 billion from the concession would be used to upgrade stadiums in Parramatta and Sydney Olympic Park.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — Google has launched a program to be available worldwide in which results of searches and news have been integrated with information from various fact-checking websites, the company said in an official blog post on Friday. "There will still be some need for human judgment at some point, yes?" Friedman asked. "Google will have to check on the trustworthiness and performance of the organizations that they are relying on for instant review of reports. © AP Photo/ Virginia Mayo, File 'Big Problem': Google Fact-Checker May Advantage Mainstream MediaHowever, Friedman cautioned that the reliability of the fact-checking program could not be ensured for subjects. "I imagine there will have to be some ‘grey zone’ scores for information that is not yet convincingly tested," he said. Friedman noted that Google had selected a more cost-effective and streamlined manner of providing fact-checking tools than directly hiring a large additional staff itself. "It seems more efficient than hiring a number of editors and staff at Google. Where would those staff go to check the data offered in an article? So I guess Google will try going directly to the trusted organizations and hire their talent to attach a label quickly about factual validity," he said. In a field such as consumer information about health care evidence for particular treatments and drugs, there have long been services to assess the current state of scientific evidence, Friedman pointed out. "They can give a range of labels about the validity of evidence to support published opinions and claims. But, I imagine Google is looking for simpler criteria about who, where, when, how of specific events," he observed. © AP Photo/ Marcio Jose Sanchez Google Seeks to Dictate Truth Using Dubious New TechnologyFriedman suggested that the new service could prove to be more timely and broadly applicable than Wikipedia. Wikipedia "limits its scope, limits its contributors and uses human intervention to remove portions of an article, but that can be a fairly slow process with appeals and editorial decisions," he noted. Google was wrong to set itself up as an arbiter of factual accuracy in the first place, University of Pittsburgh Professor of International Affairs Michael Brenner told Sputnik. "In my view, none of this is Google's business. It concerns the relationship between the individual and the state — a matter with which we have a few hundred years of experience," Brenner said. © AP Photo/ Marcio Jose Sanchez German Pirate Party Fears Potential for Censorship From Google Fact-CheckerSo long as a substantial segment of the population is thoroughly disengaged from the world around them, they will be prey to manipulations in one form or another, Brenner pointed out. "Facebook warning labels are the not the solution, nor are any of the other technical panacea being bandied about," Brenner added. Google said its fact checks would not be provided by the company as it would instead use fact-checking findings from such web sources as PolitiFact and Snopes. ...

In other words, this Google fact check program is a censure program that intends to redline or eliminate anything that doesn't fit the government. That is the worst kind of censure. PolitiFact is biased. So is Snopes. All humans are biased one way or another. As with all matters of life, a person has to take different viewpoints into consideration and find a way to integrate the into a view that makes logical sense. To what extent people do that and to what extent they blindly believe the media - is a matter of intelligence.

Daydream VR support is absent on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 1:56pm PDTApr 2, 2017 56 Plus 1 on G+ 152 Share on Facebook 87 Share on Twitter Total Shares295 Galaxy S8 News Samsung Google initially spearheaded virtual reality on Android with Google Cardboard, which evolved into the more complete Daydream VR platform. Unlike Cardboard, which could start on any somewhat-recent Android or iOS device, Daydream support requires the phone manufacturer and Google to make sure everything works. Unfortunately, it looks like Samsung isn't supporting Daydream VR on the new Galaxy S8 and S8+. According to VRHeads, trying to install the Daydream app will result in an error message. This could be due to a previous agreement with Oculus (which helped develop the Gear VR), but there's also a strong possibility that Samsung just doesn't care to support it. Admittedly, Daydream VR doesn't have very much content, and Samsung's own Gear VR platform has plenty of apps and games. Still, it's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented.

Kappa saf1927 What is VR again? Ah, some shit that everyone likes to experience once and then realises it's shit. Morten Ulv I must have missed the part where it's shit. Kevin It was actually cool. It really tricks your brain, but I had the opportunity to play a game in an open space. Only thing bad was the actual gameplay. Nothing like COD Adrian Meredith Hmm what? Vr is incredible can't go back to playing elite on a 2d screen Jesse Lee You must be using Daydream VR and not Oculus because you would have realized you're comment is complete shit. George Byers Seems that the only way to get Samsung to support anything Google is to make it compulsory in order to get access to the play store 😒 Willie Chalmers III You knew just what I was thinking. If Google included another no-compete clause in the GMS partner agreement for VR-related platforms, Daydream could finally solidify itself as the Android platform for VR. (Although, Samsung and Oculus could easily sue that Google is abusing their market share and all the other crap we have seen before for requiring partners to preload Google apps.) MicroNix And you think that would be fair when it was Samsung that was to market much earlier with VR than Google? Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.

Sorry to break it to you. But cardboard was out in June of 2014. Gear vr didn't get released until like november of 2015. Over a year later. And at that time, it was basically just a plastic google cardboard. Willie Chalmers III Well, Cardboard was introduced at I/O in May 2014, and Gear VR was released in November 2015. Daydream was released in November 2016. Does that make it any more fair? It doesn't matter if it's fair, I'm just explaining Google's options. I'm not happy about the prospects, but I noted that Google could make Daydream a requirement for GMS at the risk of an antitrust lawsuit. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) they couldn't even if they wanted to the daydream requirements are hardware specific and most phones don't meet them. Willie Chalmers III The phones already support the hardware necessary for Daydream, and Google meant EXISTING phones wouldn't support Daydream when they announced it. Google said that most new Android phones could very easily support it. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Not that simple. For example The G6 can't support it. Not because it doesn't have a screen and a gyroscope like daydream's cardboard cousin but because the LCD panel isn't capable of the fast refresh times needed for VR on that scale. I know that many of you think the gear VR is just like cardboard but it's more like a poorman's oculus. Daydream is on the same playing field as the Gear VR sure but that doesn't mean existing phones or even new ones can join the party. is every phone going to abandon LCD? I don't see that happening just yet. Willie Chalmers III Okay, I didn't realize the G6 doesn't have the hardware requirements to support Daydream, but there is (mind you) likely no reason besides an ulterior motive for the S8/S8+ not to have Daydream support. Could there be hardware requirements that the S8/S8+ don't support? Absolutely, but Daydream can already be enabled and used with the phone by editing a config file as root. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Don't get me wrong, I totally agree that the only reason samsung phones aren't daydream compatible is because of gear vr. With that said my point was only that Google could never make daydream a requirement of GMS not just for the threat of a lawsuit but because it physically wouldn't be possible Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Could? sure, will? Probably not Daisy <-<!-->M­a­n­y p­e­o­ple w­a­nt t­o ha­v­e a go­o­d earnings at their, bu­t t­he­y do­n't kno­w ho­w t­o exactly d­o th­at o­n th­e Int­ernet.

Willie Chalmers III Yeah, I noted that. That's the unfortunate reality of corporate politics. JohnyNoLegs Maybe since Samsung comes up with everything great in Android, Google should be the one using Samsung rather than the other way. Samsung Gear VR is and has been far better for ages. Kawshik Ahmed Google can't implement Gear VR to Android because it's not Open Source rather it is own by Oculus/Facebook. If a OEM share their technology with AOSP, Google have no problem to implement it, take for example Sony, who shared 50+ enhancement in Android O alone. X-47B or think Google - who don't add even the latest google search to AOSP. Is latest chrome, google assistant part of AOSP? Samsung shared KNOX with google, which they are not supposed to. Kawshik Ahmed Chrome has it's own Open Source form named Chromium so it doesn't need to be with AOSP. Anyone can use it like Opera and many others are doing. Google Search and Assistant are not features or enhancement nor part of the actual OS, they are services and it takes money to maintain the servers to run them. I don't think any company will make their services open sourced. It's like saying Samsung should open source Bixby which will never happen. blueman24 That would be good only if samsung made any polished software plus made it open source. JohnyNoLegs Google can't even do that so not sure what you are inferring. illregal Said no one ever. Samsung is a disease. Holding back true innovation with their lackluster devices. Diogo Neves Yeah, the competition really looks fierce for Samsung lol illregal buying reviews, paying to badmouth your competition, marketing dollars and dumbasses eating it up doesn't mean the device is any good. It means you've been had. JohnyNoLegs Sounds like Apple to me haha. Pixel isn't far behind... Good_Ole_Pinocchio No need to support Daydream. There's zero benefit to Samsung. MJ Yes, customer needs are of no concern to Samsung also like updates. billy routh Samsung has their own VR and it's Miles ahead of Google's crappy daydream. Chris Sanner that's...nice? but it means lock-in - if I'm on a nexus/pixel and I leave for a samsung phone...I lose what content I had. if I decide that's fine and move to samsung, if I want to leave and go back to a pixel I lose the content. that means I have to be willing to bet that I will *always* buy Samsung. and guess what - I'm not. Anthony820 And when I switch to Canon I lose all my Nikon lenses. And when I switch back I lose all my canon. And went I switched from iPhone I lost all my apps and had to re-purchase them for a new OS. I say everyone fully endorses their competition's ecosystem of services/products. Chris Sanner um...except this is like someone making a canon-based camera and refusing to support the new cannon attachments on the next release. that's kinda shitty and would be enough to keep me from buying the cannon-based camera OligarchyAmbulance "Miles ahead" lol ok Good_Ole_Pinocchio Of all customer needs, DayDream support is absolute last on that list. No need for it. They want VR? They'll get a freeheadset JohnyNoLegs Lol samsung VR??? And who needs breaking updates. MJ I am not sure why Samsung VR is so funny and... No updates for you huh? Are you one of those people still using Windows XP on their PC? JohnyNoLegs Samsung be is available for customers of Samsung, and it's far better than Daydream still. And no I'm on pixel xl running 7.1.2, but really it's the same as 7.0 so no benefit of having pixel for the past 5 months. AsterMK Daydream is far from a need. It's a want, and barely anyone wants VR in general. Of those that do want it, almost everyone prefers Gear VR. Ra1nb0wD4sh DE I would totally get a HTC Vive, but it's too expensive atm. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They want you to use GearVR MJ Yes, which is the opposite of giving customer choice aka what they may want. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Corporations don't care what you want Rob Cook Your argument is invalid, Samsung isn't forced to provide Daydream as they have developed, in their opinion a superior alternative. The customer choice here is to not buy Samsung if you feel that Daydream is the better product (arguably it's not). You logic is saying that Samsung MUST provide Daydream as well or there isn't a choice being offered at all. That's like saying that Cheverolet MUST offer a V12 quad-turbo in the Corvett because Bugatti offers one in the Chiron. Yes both are cars but that's it. MJ Ummmm The argument I never made is invalid? OK... Dude, I never said Samsung should be REQUIRED to provide Daydream support. I did infer Samsung should should give their customers options. LOL I do agree about NOT buying Samsung products. It is amazing to me all comments defending Samsung on this. Who doesn't like options and prefers a walled garden? Oh yeah... Your analogy was really stupid by the way. What I am saying is the what Ford does with their touch screen system in supporting Apples' CarPlay and Android Auto is better way to go than just supporting one or the other or using a proprietary only system. Jesse Lee Well then why didn't Google offer Oculus support on its Pixel phones....no customer support needs I guess. This was a no-brainer, I thought anyway but.... Dave I will not buy a S8 without Daydream. I was going to finally buy my first new phone since the Note 2, but now think I will wait for the Pixel 2. Mike549 They're losing my purchase of an s8 because of it. I already have the s7 with gear VR but I want access to Daydream too. YaKillaCJ Not surprising and to be expected. The general public see Samsung TouchWiz/GraceUx as Android itself. Google lost control a long time ago. Kwetsima Maluleke Not a lose. Oculus just has so much more to offer here. Morten Ulv And name one service that Samsung provice that's better than what Google offer. That's right there are none. Daydream may not be much now, but it has much more promise than Gear VR. Dominick White so people should wait until Google gets better, or go with Samsung that is know to work very well? Morten Ulv It would obviously have both. This would be like Nvidia only supporting Oculus and not Vive. They only chose to not support it, because, fuck consumers. I'm not saying it's unexpected, or that it won't work. Because Samsung obviously has a lot of power here, and VR is not a main selling point for these phones. MicroNix When Samsung is giving away a GearVR with every S8 purchase, there's not a lot of incentive to support a smaller, questionable as to how long it will be around because its Google, VR platform. Morten Ulv Samsung will not give away a GearVR with every S8, you must be dreaming. Perhaps as a time limited and location limited promotional offer. EcE It is at launch but they also do it every high season (black Friday, back to school, etc) and there are promotions quite often. As much as I would like to use some cardboard apps/videos on my s7 (and obviously daydream) there's zero incentive for Samsung to support it. And like a lot of people here, I wouldn't be surprised if Google would just ditch it in a couple of years JohnyNoLegs Gear VR was before Daydream, google decided to add another one to the group. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They chose not to support it because they are not idiots. Why would they risk losing VR market share? MicroNix Until Google gets tired of it and stops active support of it. Are you new to Google products or something? Dubs816 Name one service that Samsung provides that's better than what Google offers? Let's see... ever heard of Samsung Pay? The service that works in tens of thousands of places Android Pay doesn't? JohnyNoLegs Man it's too late, typical google. Copy Samsung years down the road then expect everyone to pick it up. Gear VR is already established and has a user base. illregal Samsung copied google here.. There's no debate, gear vr came out way after cardboard. samsung pay, etc.. All out after google. Samsung hasn't had an original thought in years, unless it has to do with ripping off their idiot customers. JohnyNoLegs I didn't know Cardboard had sensors in it..... I thought it was just a piece of cardboard with a lense... dhamp2g Cardboard was 1st dude!!! JohnyNoLegs Then VR with actual sensors and lag free use came out... DragoCubed Samsung pay. Kwetsima Maluleke Android TV? Android Pay? The Samsung counterparts are better. Kwetsima Maluleke And you delusional if you think the Daydream VR will catch up to the Gear VR. Whether its sales or content. Nathan J You can root for Oculus if you want, but you have to accept and be transparent about the fact that it's owned and controlled by Facebook. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has left. What you mean is that Facebook has so much more to offer. The major players in the VR space are Valve (HTC Vive), Facebook (Oculus Rift), and Google (Daydream). I won't deny that Facebook is in the lead here, but I have no intention of supporting them against the other two. I personally like Daydream, since it uses phones. I hope Apple doesn't develop their own thing, and just works with Google (as they have on search, and Google apps working so well on iOS). Daydream being multi-platform would be huge. illregal oculus is proprietary crap and losing badly to vive. Kwetsima Maluleke Is it? Jordon De La Cruz Does the s8 fit into the previous gear VR? Kwetsima Maluleke Nope. Only the new one. fredric If Samsung had to choose between Oculos or Google's Daydream, it a no brainier to choose Oculos since they're mostly the acknowledged pioneers in this field. The really​ important question is, are they truly forced into choosing only one of them?? My first thought when I saw their new GearVR set with a controller was Daydream support. They're either working towards supporting it, or just a good feature they can't ignore. In either case (and my opinion, at least), almost nothing is still worth getting a VR headset for (including Vive and the Rift) but would still be interested into trying it for its reasonable price. Leif Sikorski That's not a big suprise I think. GearVR feels much more responsive than Daydream so it makes sense to focus on the new GearVR instead of Daydream which was very late in the game. Samsung and Oculus stand behind their VR solution since years while Google hasn't done much yet and is known for quickly quitting such things. Ryan IMHO Gear and daydream provide the very same experience in term of quality. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Is anyone surprised by this news? AbbyZFresh Does it really matter? Developers seem to be supporting and releasing apps for GearVR more than they've been doing for DayDream. shonangreg Can I use Gear VR on my non-Samsung phones? No? Then it is doomed. When one or two competitors are good enough and available across devices (and platforms), then VR app makers will go to them (and Samsung might open Gear VR to prevent this also). There is no reason to play this stupid vendor lock-in game with VR headsets. AbbyZFresh I would agree with you except for the following factors. 1. Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones) than all the other following Andorid brands combined. Which means Samsung has the most exposure. 2. Gear VR is supported by Oculus, which means it will always have relevance since the two platforms are increasingly linked. 3. Samsung is actively pushing VR with their phones pushing demos for people to try. Couldn't find any places to demo Daydream. shonangreg I don't think you're right on point #1. Samsung has about 20% of the worldwide smartphone market, and android is about 85% of that: http://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor So just off the top of my head, Samsung has maybe 30% of the android market. Point #2: I didn't know that. If they're making Gear VR cross platform like that, then it would be way more worthwhile. X-47B You need context in everything. #1: Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones). S/He's right in that saying Samsung leads VR-compatible phone sales. Gear VR had shipped around 5 million in 2016, more than every other brands combined. Mike549 Verizon stores have Daydream devices for demo purposes. Joshua Hill Can I use daydream on the G6 or any other non pixel flagship??? No then it's doomed lol Dominick White well to be honest it's kinda supported on axon 7 Joshua Hill My bad, now that i've actually checked some moto z phones have daydream support too. Allegedly if you root your phone and insert a single line of code any device is daydream compatible including the S8. JohnyNoLegs Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL. Also Gear VR is still better than Daydream, and has more games and support. Samsung actually support VR...unlike google... Joshua Hill dude you replied to the wrong person or your comprehension sucks!!! lol I was pointing out how ridiculous shonangreg's comment was and how his arguments against gear vr could also be applied to daydream. Oops!!!!!! hahaha JohnyNoLegs Fair enough but it wasn't immediately obvious, considering that Samsung don't support daydream is actually kinda stupid. But yes ignore me then. Klark Kenneth Wait, are you saying it's a fail or are you saying "No? FAIL."? MJ "Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL." What the hell is that supposed to mean? Jesse Lee Dude, stop trolling. Nexus phones were made by Google, the N6 was less then 2 years old when Daydream VR came out and Google didn't even support it. Yet, you're comments seem to contradict that reality and keep bashing Sammy when Google's support is much much worse when it comes to VR. You're barking up the wrong tree is how the expression goes and its apparent from reading this section. MJ Speak about trolling... The OP statement I quoted made so sense so I asked him to explain it. What does that have to do with you buddy? Daydream is NOT supported on the Nexus 6? So what? You need minimal hardware support for a good experience so it's better than something like Cardboard. FACT: Samsung’s first consumer Gear VR headset didn't support any previous Samsung phones either. FACT: Goggle Daydream is open to other OEMs while Samsung's VR solution is NOT. Now go away... Mike549 Agreed. I think the same applies to the Rift and Vive for exclusive too. Ryan The most targeted platform is Cardboard... ShahinTr Utterly convenient.. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/60efae9a00168334a9c265167f8a740795662842c4f1394c015eb51fd1b99d36.jpg MicroNix Which was first, Gear VR or Daydream? Which do you think will be around the longest, something from Samsung or something from Google? There, that should put things into perspective for you. ShahinTr Dude. Jeez. It's a meme. Just go with it. Please. MicroNix Its just an overused term in Android. TannoV It's also a true term. Sudev Together but not the same :) Mert Oculus Store has many options. But anyway, my Gear VR is waiting me with a lots of dusts on it. That technology is going to die if someone won't come with a solid idea. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean there are solid ideas. That doesn't mean people actually want it though. Good ideas don't always sell. Mert I can't say whole store is garbage but still VR tech looking desperately for it's own Angry Birds. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I think everyday people would want more Triple A titles that aren't games. Less games and more pushing life like experiences will help bring folks onboard. Then the next step should be having these experiences at the same time with Friends and family. Not a "My turn ,your turn" set up that we have now. Jose Romero Good, this will only make Google work harder to make Daydream a success and to improve it. Vivek Rameses Good. Jon Fridman VR is a little pointless on smartphones. I'd understand buying a HTC Vive or Oculus VR for your PC not for a phone. I've tried the Google Daydream for the Pixel XL and Samsung Gear VR, neither are what I'd call good. I'd rather use my desktop for VR or nothing. Phones aren't up to par with what VR needs yet. I think using a phone hurts the public image of what VR is truly capable of. Ryan I disagree it's a bit like the console/PC war non sense. While I understand people might want to only experience it on PC for obvious reasons there are a lot of smaller players that are enjoying mobile VR a lot. While it's true there is a lot of crap in the store there are some really good games. Jon Fridman VR on phones doesn't look anywhere near as good based on experience. Consoles are irrelevant to this as well because they still don't have the raw power a PC can (yes thst includes the PS VR headset). While the graphics may look decent, they can't compare to higher end systems. Once VR has matured I think it'll be fine to use on phones. In the current state I cannot see a reason to use a VR headset. I won't buy one for my PC either despite having a more than capable set up (i7 6800K/EVGA 1080FTW/32GB RAM). When the next generation comes out I'll likely buy one. senor_heisenberg Eh, neither platform is particularly worthwhile. That said, I'll always prefer to have​ the one that's not tied to a single OEM's hardware. Joshua Hill At the moment they both are lol op12 Daydream expanded beyond the Pixel a while ago... https://vr.google.com/daydream/phones/#daydream-ready-phones Jesse Lee Yeah, it works great on any phone now named Pixel Grey "It's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented." I agree on that, but you have to agree that Google can't own everything, and that companies shouldn't allow Google to own everything, or go along with Google on all of its ideas. It's like Steam. Would it be easier if all PC games were on Steam and I didn't need anything more? Sure. Would it be better for the market? No. Me Not really surprising Kenny One the one hand, it's nice to have options. On the other hand, if Google tries to require Daydream support as a prerequisit for certification, then it might end up being another Microsoft case of using the platform to force dorminance. Then again, it's also nice to not have fragmentation. Life is so difficult ... :/ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Be together, not the same. Differentiation means competition, which is a good thing. Joshua Hill Competition is bad when it means a potential lack of content. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's only bad for the loser of the competition. But that's why competition is good. The best thing wins out. Joshua Hill Ah no. It's bad for the consumer who cannot acquire the content they desire on their platform as well. How did you not get the point??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You don't understand competition, then. Remember Betamax? It lost. So people stopped caring about content on Betamax. Same thing here. May the best VR win, and then all the content will go there. Joshua Hill Are we talking about today or some unspecified future date you have in your head??? The future is irrelevant as neither of these formats will survive in their current iterations. Consumers will have to buy a new VR I do remember betamax and I bet those users who owned VHS's but couldn't buy the content they wanted because it was exclusive to Betamax would comprehend my point. You do understand that this sort of competition breeds exclusive content. Going back to my initial comment which you seem not to comprehend, this leads to a 'potential lack of content' for the consumer. This means the consumer loses too. Joshua Hill I'm not saying competition is all bad. You claimed it was good and I provided an example of how it can also be bad for the consumer. If you can't comprehend this and discuss the issue I've raised there's really no point continuing the conversation. pfmiller There's a big difference between this and a format war between two physically incompatible storage mediums like VHS and Betamax. There's no reason why a modern phone can't support both Daydream and Gear VR. Atoqir Well that is saying like "Why do my PS4 exclusives don't work on Xbox" There is always some artificial lockout to make a platform more attractive. And I don't think it's a bad thing. It makes competitors do better and create the best platform for the biggest chunk of users. And the least popular loses and doesn't have a vibrant ecosystem. Look at Windows Mobile as prime example. Cause we are not talking about regular hardware products anymore. These days every products is a weapon the "wars of the ecosystems/platforms" Joshua Hill Be together implies that competing formats should be supported on all phones that have the hardware capabilities to do so. This is more a case of 'Go it alone, we're all different anyways' ;) Wilton Daniel Pinto VR has no future. Duh😪 dhamp2g This is some bull. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, ROB Since when has Samsung ever stood for support... can you imagine how long it would take to get an update for the program... hell I am still waiting for 7.0 ast00 VR on phones is pointless. But still... Why? Because Samsung . Kevin Davis Is anyone actually surprised? kalehv Is it just me that owns a pixel, has a free daydream viewer but doesn't even care to dust it off? Ryan VR is not pleasing for everyone.But there are a lot of people that love it. kalehv Oh I love it too. but there's not much to do yet. Margaritas Ante Porcos lol Samsung is digging its grave. Everyday something bad comes up about on s8. tim242 Haha you have been smoking some bad shit. Joshua Hill Can i have some of what you're on??? I'm not a samsung fan, I'm prolly getting an S8 but my last sammy was an S2. I'd like to hear the drug induced reasoning to your claim lol Margaritas Ante Porcos You comment is rude. At your age you should know how to communicate without rudeness, shouldn't you? Joshua Hill If you are going to spread malicious misinformation and not substantiate it you should be used to rude replies! Margaritas Ante Porcos And yet you are continuing being impolite. Obviously, you've got personal reasons to disrespect absolute strangers on the web. After all the world is spinning around your corrosive little ego, isn't it? I don't find it entertaining to feed your unhealthy appetite for ridiculing others. So, bite me. Joshua Hill My 2nd response was not impolite at all it was a simple opinion or statement of the facts as I see it. Would you care to discuss the crux of the issue. I'm still awaiting for you to substantiate the original claim you made which i consider malicious and factually incorrect! 'Everyday something bad', you must have an awfully long list of bad things about the S8 that have been revealed and yet so far you have provided none! Joshua Hill Thanks for feeding my appetite by responding and then offering your body ;) Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Just like Android Wear vs. Samsung Gear watches... very very annoying! "But they said in the store my watch is 100% Android compatible" As an Android Wear developer I get this question on a daily basis (even though I try to make it clear in the app description and inside the app too). It is extremely confusing to regular people. Now the same all over again with VR. Ryan And this is why, as a VR Dev , I only target cardboard for now. Hope the VR future will be brighter and easier for everyone! It is a really good medium. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So you'd rather target a limited audience rather than a large one? How is this a good business decision? darkvadur 1 April??..... Sudev Together but not the same :) Mike549 I was going to get the S8 if it supported both platforms but not now. I'll just keep my S7 and get a Daydream compatible phone if an interesting one comes out soon. Sean Thomas to be fair...daydream is bad. I haven't used Gear VR, but Daydream isn't worth it right now if they already have a platform with more support. Daydream shouldn't be on par with oculus if it's bad tbh. Google should just work with oculus to make an android-wide deal. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Serious question: Does the Pixel / Pixel XL support Gear VR? Jordan L probably not, I'm guessing Gear VR is a Samsung exclusive thing. Whereas Daydream is available to all. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Isn't Gear VR the same VR as Oculus? If so, it's not Samsung exclusive. Jordan L I don't know. I thought it was called Samsung Gear VR. Oculus has a VR framework that is available to cell phone makers? If that's true, then Daydream should work work that, I agree. A big part of Daydream was the ability for other companies to join in. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I googled it. Yes, Samsung Gear VR is powered by Oculus. So it's probably going to have the most content, which is what will make it the most successful VR. If it turns out Daydream gets the most content, then I'm sure Samsung will support it. Otherwise they'll lose customers. This is no different than prior format wars like Betamax vs. VHS or HD DVD vs. Blu-ray. Whoever gets the most content wins. Jordan L Fragmentation. Google allows all companies to attempt to do Daydream... so Samsung does their own thing. Chris Sanner Dear Samsung: this sort of shit is why I refuse to buy any more of your phones. like, ever. dhamp2g WTF this type of shit kills me. Why wouldn't google make it required to use android?????. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Why does it bother you? If Daydream wins the VR competition, then Samsung will either lose customers or be forced to support Daydream. If Gear VR wins, then Google and Daydream phones will either lose customers or be forced to support it. That's the way the free market works. dhamp2g bc I bought a daydream when it was on sale bc I though 4sure that the s8 would support it. I will get the next pixel when it comes out and ditch my s8 and use my s7 for gearVR. I wanted one phone for both. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck with that! I don't care about VR, but if I did, I'd get the phone that supports VR with the most content. That's what determines the end game. Suicide_Note VR is crap, and anything that speeds its demise is fine by me. https://media0.giphy.com/media/d4aTnvQuF6xyfgWI/giphy.gif kgptzac Anyone with a brain should not find this surprising, and should be easily see the reasons behind it. Once again the burden falls to developers to either make exclusives, or games that support multiple VR platforms. It's not unfair either... developers have always been choosing between sony and microsoft on consoles, and google and apple on mobile, so it's fair game. likurges daydream is a gimmick. useless crap in it's current form. On the other hand samsung is an ass for not supporting it Averix No great loss. VR is a fad for right now. The lack of content makes that obvious. Since they're giving away a headset for the Samsung Oculus experience, I don't think Daydream matters much here. Jesse Lee "Could" be Samsung's deal with Oculus?! Absolutely it has to do with the competing VR platform offered by Oculus. I guess I never would have thought they were going to and never got hopes up for it just the same as I never thought the Pixel was going to include Oculus software, kind of a no-brainer really. Jordan L It's possible the Samsung could support both VR's, and maybe Oculus is elusive to Samsung? So pixel couldn't support both platforms. If that's true, then one could hope Samsung would support both.(it was a long shot). Daydream is open to all manufactures... Is Oculus?

Yesterday GOOG: 823.35 -1.38 Google Assistant adds ‘Notifications’ toggle in settings for phones and Home Abner Li - Apr. 11th 2017 9:32 pm PT @technacity Apps & Updates Google Assistant Google app View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Earlier this evening, Google Assistant added a new “Notifications” option in settings on both phones and Google Home. Unfortunately, the new setting does not appear to do anything yet. Nintendo Switch Going to Google Assistant’s settings will reveal a new Notifications toggle under “Adjust settings for this device.” It has popped up on all my phones, with others noting that it also appears in Google Home’s Assistant settings. Receive notifications like weather updates on this device. Even if notifications are off, you’ll still hear alarms and important updates. While the setting did not immediately show up after the Google app was updated to version 7.0 this morning, it does not appear on older versions of the app. Enabled by default, the toggle does not properly work yet. Switching off and exiting the app will automatically re-enable the setting. Incidentally, the toggle remains on even if Assistant is entirely disabled. One straightforward possibility is that Google is consolidating Assistant and Feed/Now card settings. At the moment, the Google Assistant does not technically issue notifications. The Google app, specifically the Feed, is responsible for providing alerts for weather, commute times, and sport scores. Alternatively, Google could be working on having the Assistant provide notifications. This would likely just be a rebrand, but for end users could simplify features under Assistant.

Are you ready to give Samsung another shot after last year's exploding Galaxy Note 7 scandal? The troubled electronics giant just released its newest flagship phone, the Samsung Galaxy S8. If you've taken an iPhone detour while Samsung worked out its issues and are ready to return to Android with the Galaxy S8, then you'll want to take a few things with you, namely your contacts and calendar, your texts, photos and music. Before you get started switching, you'll need to sign up for a Google account if you aren't already using Gmail. You can sign up for a Google account here, which you'll then need when setting up the Galaxy S8. With a Gmail address in tow, it's time to getting started with moving over the data you have stored on your iPhone.

You'll see the "transfer from iOS device" option when you first set up your new Galaxy phone, or you can access the app once you've completed the setup process. Search for the Samsung Smart Switch Mobile app in the Google Play store on your Samsung device and hit update. Once you're able to open the app, tap through until you see the two transfer options on screen. Transfer via USB For the first option (the most reliable of the two) you'll need a Lightning cable and the small USB-C to USB adaptor that comes with your new S8. Plug the adapter into the Samsung phone, the Lightning cable to the iPhone and then connect the two. You should immediately see a message pop up on your iPhone. Tap Trust on the iPhone, and then Next on the Galaxy to continue, then wait a few minutes while it searches for data to transfer. Once this is done, you'll see a list of content available for transfer from the iPhone to the S8: contacts, text message history, call log, music, photos and even Wi-Fi settings are fair game. Select all the categories you want to transfer and tap Transfer on the Galaxy. Now take a coffee break because this may take a while, depending on how much baggage you plan on bringing along with you. The phone will display an estimated wait time on the top of the screen. When it has completed the transfer you'll have a few more download options to choose from. There's even a list of all your old iOS apps, with links to manually reinstall their Android counterparts. Make your final selections and then welcome to your old phone. Even the wallpaper should look familiar if you transferred that too, but on a sexier screen. Transfer over Wi-Fi If you don't have the adapter, you can also chose the wireless option, as long as you have your iPhone backed up to iCloud and a solid Wi-Fi connection. You'll need to sign in to your iCloud account on your Galaxy phone to continue, but the remaining steps should be similar. Or, if you'd rather not give Samsung complete control over the content you're transferring, there are content-specific apps you can download to help you transfer everything individually. Mail, Contacts and Calendar If you are already using a Gmail account for your Contacts, Calendar and Mail on iOS, then you're all set; just sign into the Galaxy S8 with the same account you use on your iPhone and make sure sync is enabled for Mail, Contacts and Calendar. Go to Settings > Mail > Accounts and tap your Gmail account and then toggle on Mail, Contacts and Calendar. If you're all-in on iOS and are using an iCloud account, you can still transfer your contacts and calendars but you're going to need the help of an app. On the Galaxy S8, install SmoothSync for Cloud Calendar to grab your calendar appointments and reminders and SmoothSync for Cloud Contacts for your contacts. These two apps will add your iCloud account to the Galaxy S8, letting you continue to use your Mac or iPad and keeping your calendar and contacts in sync. Text messages If you need to take your texts with you, give free app iSMS2droid a try. I haven't used it, but the app gets positive marks online, has a good rating in the Google Play store, and has been updated somewhat recently. It requires you to make an unencrypted backup of your iPhone to iTunes, locate and copy the backup SMS database file and then import it from the Galaxy S8. Take a look at the developer's step-by-step instructions. Music If you stream music with Apple Music, Pandora or Spotify, then you've got no worries. Just download the apps (yes, there's an Android version of Apple Music) on the Galaxy S8, log into your account, and your playlists and preferences will be there waiting for you. If you've amassed an iTunes music library that's too large and valuable to give up for a streaming music service, then you will need to head to Google Play Music on Chrome or download Google's Music Manager app on the Mac or PC that has your iTunes library and point it at your music collection. Google lets you store up to 50,000 songs for free in the cloud, which you can then stream on the Galaxy S8. Photos and videos The easiest way to get the photos and videos from your iPhone to your Android device is to install Google Photos on your iPhone and upload the files. (You can also use Google Drive to perform a backup of your photos by going to Settings > Backup.) Then you can just log into Google Photos on the Galaxy S8 and either view them from their spot in the cloud or download them. You can perform a similar maneuver with cross-platform cloud apps such as Dropbox and Flickr. If you have a large photo library on iCloud, you use the Photos app on a Mac or iCloud.com on a PC to download photos to your computer to transfer via USB to your Galaxy S8.

Nvidia has revealed that Accelerated Computing in data centres is driven by Artificial Intelligence, causing the dramatic change seen in data centres today. The company refers to deep learning in particular, which is an algorithm that is able to learn from vast amounts of data to create software that can tackle challenges such as language translation and teaching autonomous cars to drive. In order for deep learning to work effectively however, it demands that computers process the vast amounts of data in good time. This is what leads to the invention of new computing architecture. This is where Nvidia’s GPU-accelerated computing model, originally designed for computing graphics and supercomputing applications, is also ideal for deep learning. Nvidia launched its Pascal-based Tesla P40 Inferencing Accelerator which was built to deliver 26x of its deep-learning inferencing performance. Read more: IBM Cloud boosts AI computing with Nvidia Tesla GPU In 2015, Google designed a custom accelerator chip called the tensor processing unit (TPU), also made to handle inferencing. Nvidia makes a comparison with Google’s TPU, in which it identifies that its P40 balances computational precision and throughput, on-chip memory and memory bandwidth to achieve unprecedented performance for training and inferencing. Its P40 has a high-throughput 8-it integer and high-memory bandwidth, whereas Google’s TPU was only developed for inferencing so does not offer training. Although Google and Nvidia’s development path differ for obvious reasons, several themes make them similar as well. This firstly leads back to the importance of accelerated computing for AI. In a blog post, Nvidia said: “The technology world is in the midst of a historic transformation already being referred to as the AI Revolution. The place where its impact is most obvious in the hyperscale data centers of Alibaba, Amazon, Baidu, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Tencent and others.” Secondly, Nvidia says Tensor processing is a major new workload that enterprises are advised to consider when building modern data centres as it is at the core of delivering for deep learning and inference. This can also lead to a reduction of building costs. According to Nvidia, without deployed accelerated computing, the scale-out of AI is not practical.   Tags Accelerated computing AI Deep learning Google NVIDIA Previous ArticleWhat is VPN?

Nelson02/29/2016 One of the features of Samsung’s recent phones has been the ability to use the phone as a virtual reality (VR) headset. Here’s how to do it with your iPhone, instead. Between the Samsung Gear VR and Google’s Cardboard VR initiatives, it’s been a good year for mobile virtual reality. While the various editions of Samsung’s Gear VR work with multiple smartphones, they are limited to the expensive Samsung flagships. Google’s Cardboard, meanwhile, has made virtual reality available to anyone with an Android phone. Although not widely publicized – in part because Apple hasn’t announced any sort of VR project – Google’s Cardboard has worked with the iPhone and iOS for some time. The development efforts for virtual reality on the iPhone still lag significantly in comparison to the sorts of apps and experiences you see hitting Android, but it’s still fun to try. Why would you want to try VR on the iPhone? The experiences may be slight, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t worthwhile. Among some of the experiences you can try on the iPhone include a movie player that renders a virtual movie theater to watch things in, a short but fun trip on a roller coaster, developed by the Cedar Point amusement park, and a collection of fun shorts within the Google Cardboard iPhone app. Aside from these, however, it can be a wonderful way to introduce friends and family to the idea of modern VR. Most people born in the 70s and later is familiar with what virtual reality sounds like, but they’re also aware that every implementation until has been pretty terrible. New headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive offer a more immersive experience than ever – and while the mobile headsets can’t quite compare, they can manage a pretty compelling experience in their own right. How do I use an iPhone with VR? Trying out iPhone VR is actually super easy. It’s almost as simple as downloading an app – because you’ll need both a VR-aware app, and a headset that converts your iPhone’s screen into a virtual reality display. Explore the App Store on your own, or try one of the apps we linked above. Ultimately, it comes down to two steps: Launch a VR app on the iPhone. Insert phone into headset and hold it up to your eyes. When it comes to finding a headset, good news: you can get a pretty good experience without having to spend much money. The easiest way is to look for a headset that says it’s compatible with Google Cardboard. It may or may not mention the iPhone, but as long as you make sure it supports your screen size, it should work okay. You can use any modern iPhone – say, iPhone 5 and newer, though there are two caveats. First, a larger iPhone like the 6/6s and 6 Plus/6s Plus will fit in most VR headsets better than a small model; secondly, the 6 Plus and 6s Plus has a higher pixel density, so it’ll naturally look nicer when magnified in one of these headsets. If you’re looking for the absolute least investment possible to try out VR with your iPhone, take a look at the new Google Goggle Tech C1-Glass VR Viewer. At only fifteen dollars, this headset folds completely flat. It won’t work well for movies unless you only use it in a dark room, as nothing is there to block outside light. For just double the fifteen dollar asking price, Mattel, of all people, have put out the Mattel View-Master VR Starter Pack, which updates the famous toy (confession: I originally wrote 80s toy before checking and discovering that the first View-Master came out in 1939!) for use as a modern virtual reality headset. Note: you’ll need to use your headphones with either one of these headsets, as there are no connections with the iPhone.

 Samsung's new Siri rival won't be fully functional when the Galaxy S8 launches Jeff Dunn Apr. 11, 2017, 11:06 PM 1,522 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Samsung Galaxy S8's Bixby AI assistant. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider Samsung's new voice assistant, Bixby, is off to a rough start. In a statement sent to media outlets on Tuesday night, Samsung confirmed that the AI helper will not support voice commands when it launches alongside the company's flagship Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ phones on April 21. The company says you won't be able to talk to Bixby until "later this spring." The assistant's other features — including a "Bixby Vision" tool that can identify real-world objects and display related info onscreen, a "Bixby Home" tool that serves up Google-like info cards, and a "Bixby Reminder" tool that helps you set, well, reminders — will still be available at launch, according to Samsung. Samsung did not immediately respond to a comment on the reason for the delay. It's worth noting, however, that we ran into bugs as recently as two weeks ago when previewing the new Galaxy S8. It's also worth noting that, conceptually, Samsung has not pitched Bixby as a one-to-one competitor to other popular voice helpers like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Google's Google Assistant. Those companies have spent the past few years building out such assistants in the hopes that they will be the next dominant interfaces for personal computing. Business Insider Here, though, Samsung mostly wants Bixby to make navigating its phones less complicated. The idea is to call on Bixby when you want to, say, change your screen brightness, or find a specific photo within your camera roll. That won't be possible until a future update now.  Nevertheless, with the more capable Google Assistant pre-loaded onto the phone by default — and with limited language support to start — Bixby's staggered launch will not do it any favors out of the gate. Samsung will then have to deal with the AI's more existential problems, namely convincing app developers to lend their support and expanding onto other devices, in the future. Either way, this is clearly a work in progress. We've found the new Galaxy phones to be promising on their own, but Samsung had pitched Bixby as one of their trademark features to the point where it built a dedicated Bixby button onto the side of the devices. Though it is possible to map that button to open another app, the workaround is a bit technical, which means that many Galaxy owners will be left with a shortcut to a limited AI on their new, pricey phones for at least a few weeks. We'll have a full review of the Galaxy S8 soon, so stay tuned.

"I have a problem with how they are to validate information," Binney, a veteran US government cryptanalyst, told Sputnik. The blog post said the company was making the Fact Check label in Google News available everywhere and expanding it into Search globally in all languages. Only publishers that are algorithmically determined to be an authoritative source of information will qualify for inclusion, the statement added. Binney expressed concern about Google’s condition. "It causes me a big problem. For example, if publishers from MSM [mainstream media] are included then I see problems right off the bat," he stated. © AP Photo/ Marcio Jose Sanchez German Pirate Party Fears Potential for Censorship From Google Fact-CheckerAccording to Google, when a user searches for information that is based on public claims, an authoritative result containing the fragment of text with accompanying fact checks will be made available to that user. The snippet will display information on the claim as to who made the claim and the fact check of that particular claim, Google said in its post. However, Binney said Google had yet to demonstrate they had a transparent and credible process to make that distinction. "Somewhere they need to distinguish between opinion and documents that could stand up in court. I don't see where they have established a validation process," he cautioned. © AP Photo/ Virginia Mayo, File Google Fact-Check Created to Promote MSM Amid Waning Popularity – LawmakerGoogle added that the fact checks would not be provided by Google itself and would instead use fact-checking findings from such web sources as PolitiFact and Snopes. This information will be presented so that users could make "more informed judgments. William Binney, a cryptanalyst and mathematician, served for 30 years as senior analyst at the National Security Agency (NSA).

What is with this brand new meme? Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi ad has gone viral for all the wrong reasons Industry News / Big Tech / Google / Google accused of systemic pay discrimination by US Department of Labour By Julia Breakey on 10 April, 2017 breakeypls Share Google has come under fire in the last few months, as the US Department of Labour seeks to prove that it systematically pays the women in its workforce less than men. In January, the DoL filed a lawsuit against the company, requesting that it release its salary data and documents to the government. And on Friday, the Department testified in court that it had significant evidence that proves Google is underpaying its female staff. “The investigation is not complete,” Janet Herold, a DoL regional director, told The Guardian, “but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.” She adds that Google’s discrimination against women is “quite extreme, even in this industry.” Herald is referring to the infamous discrimination against women in the STEM fields. In the US, women fill out 50% of all jobs, but only 25% of STEM jobs. Even when acquiring STEM degrees, women are less likely to acquire a job in the field than their male peers. And when they do get a job in the field, they are paid substantially less than men. ‘The department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters’ Google has consistently touted its goal of closing all gender and race pay gaps in its workplace, and last week tweeted that it had eliminated the gap altogether. Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay. All employers can take steps to eliminate the gender and race pay gaps, today → https://t.co/KTuGTJMV16pic.twitter.com/rBciSK21uF — Google (@Google) April 4, 2017 The company is refusing to hand over the data the Department is requesting, claiming it has no need as it publishes thorough reviews every year. “Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap,” read a statement to The Guardian. “Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology.” The company also argued that the data sought would reveal confidential information, and violated employees’ privacy. Herold claimed the Department required additional information than what Google has already disclosed so as to fully back up its findings.

Android Nougat makes it excellent for working on the go, and it'll handle the most demanding games easily. Supplier GOOGLE Price $599 USD > Pricing info Tweet Email this Print this Feedback A year after launch, but the latest Android updates keep the Pixel C relevant. Ever since the first Asus Transformer, companies have been trying to make a tablet that could actually be used for work. Microsoft's Surface has gradually been building momentum, Apple has followed with the iPad Pro, and now Google has joined the fray with the Pixel C, a 10-inch tablet with a keyboard.  But what does the C stand for: capable or culpable? Commendable or condemnable? Crafty or crud? Maybe it just stands for 'computer'. Anyway: to the review!   GOOGLE PIXEL C DESIGN: COMPACT Basically, what you're looking at is a small Chromebook Pixel, only with a detachable keyobard. The Pixel C is very light and thin, to the extent that I briefly carried it tucked inside the dust jacket of a large hardback book. The two halves are held together by magnets, and to put it into laptop mode you pull the tablet and keyboard apart, flip the tablet over and let the magnets click it into position. The hinge can then be rotated to hold the screen upright. The hinge is pretty firm and the magnet on the back is strong, so despite its small size, it feels quite solid. It rests comfortably on your knees for typing, and because the footprint is small, it fits easily onto one of the tiny little tables on the backs of plane and train seats, spaces that a laptop or a Surface would be too large to fill. GOOGLE PIXEL C KEYBOARD: CWERTYTASTIC Probably the most important feature for a device like this is its keyboard, and the Pixel C's is surprisingly good. 'Surprisingly', because it looks so small, but actually the typing area is normal - the keys are full-size, and they have decent travel (a full 1.4mm, key travel fans). It feels like a smaller version of the superb keyboard on its big brother, the Chromebook Pixel. It’s a lot quicker and easier to type on than the Transformer tablets, or the Surface Pro 4. Some sensible choices have been made in the design, too: classic shortcuts like Alt-Tab do just what you expect them to do. An ellipsis key next to the space bar brings up symbols (as on a phone keyboard), which is really handy. To counteract the usefulness of this key, tapping the Alt key in Google Docs brings up a menu of stupidly grinning emoji. There are even some nice Pixel-specific tweaks to Google Docs waiting within Android, including the ability to easily drag pictures and references into your document. Your hands are very close to the screen, much closer than they are when using a Surface. This can be a good thing in that it makes the transition between the keys and the touchscreen very simple and intuitive. The touchscreen on the Chromebook Pixel isn’t really necessary because there’s a mousepad, but here you’ll use it a lot.  The connection to the keyboard is wireless (Bluetooth) but there’s no lag whatsoever and it never asks you to pair it. The keyboard also charges wirelessly from the tablet, so you just plug the whole thing into a USB charger and never really have to consider them as separate elements. GOOGLE PIXEL C DISPLAY: CRISPY The 2560x1800 display is sharper and brighter than that of the iPad Air 2, cramming in over 300 pixels per inch (the MacBook Pro Retina has 227 ppi).   It's a really, really nice screen, and again it's reminiscent of the expensive componentry you get on Chromebook Pixels. You'll be horrified the first time you go to delete some emails and leave a fingersmear of biscuit chocolate across the middle of it.   The IPS panel doesn't have the deepest blacks or the highest contrast (you'll need an AMOLED-equipped Galaxy Tab S3 for those), but colours look natural and it's plenty bright enough. It makes the most of its display, too, with some powerful Android hardware. The Pixel C shares the same internals as Nvidia’s Shield Console, pairing a Tegra X1 chip with 3GB of RAM. As a result, Goat Simulator loads in seconds, and runs without the slightest lag. Apps open quickly, multi-tasking is smooth as butter, and the fancy card effects of Blizzard's Hearthstone all appear with no stutter or dips to the frame rate. Even a year on from launch, the Pixel C still holds its own with anything available in the Google Play Store. GOOGLE PIXEL C SOFTWARE: CONTROLLED BY ANDROID Having Android running the show gives the Pixel C its major advantage over Chromebooks. There are reasons to like ChromeOS - namely its speed and simplicity - but Android’s choice of apps is years ahead.  You can use other browsers, such as Firefox or Ghostery, and apps like Spotify, BBC iPlayer and Amazon Instant Video run natively and allow you to store music, movies and TV on the device, so you can play them offline. In fact you can run everything that ChromeOS has to offer on Android, plus hundreds of other things, including thousands of games and powerful photo editors like Adobe's Lightroom. Even now that a handful of Chromebooks have access to the App store, the Pixel C still handles it better. It also helps that Android updates are still forthcoming. Google added version 7.0 Nougat to the Pixel C in 2016, giving it some much-needed multi-window abilities for working on two apps at once. The latest string of tweaks even added the new-look launcher from Google's Pixel smartphones, letting you open the app drawer with a swipe. Tapping the Recents key shows all your open apps as preview windows now, too - it's a whole lot easier to switch between multiple apps now. A Google Pill widget lets you jump straight into a search window from the home screen, and all the icons have been swapped for sleeker, rounded ones. It's a minor visual overhaul, but one that shows Google still has plans for its tablets. GOOGLE PIXEL C BATTERY LIFE: CHARGED BY USB-C In our video rundown, test the Pixel averaged around 10% battery loss per hour, so it’ll match the iPad Air and iPad Pro with 10 hours of watching movies or web browsing. You could comfortably expect to get at least one working day (a long working day, including commutes) of use out of the Pixel C, without needing to charge it. And if you do need to charge it, the charger is a small and light phone-type one, or you can just plug its USB-C cable into any port. Using the supplied charger will cause the Pixel C to smugly declare that it's charging 'rapidly'. With a larger battery to fill it doesn't hoover up electrojuice quite as quickly as a OnePlus 3T, but it's still pretty speedy. Another nice Pixel design point is that you can tap the closed Pixel C (or the table near it) and the lightbar on the back will tell you how much battery it has left. GOOGLE PIXEL C CAMERA: CAMERA-EQUIPPED There's an 8MP camera on the back of the tablet, but if the Pixel C was a phone, we'd be deeply unimpressed by the quality of its photos. Images look grainy, even in good light, and with no HDR mode, have a tendency to blow out the highlights in brighter scenes.  Google's camera app is basic at best, with hardly any manual controls, so if looking like a pillock while trying to take photos with a tablet wasn't enough, the Pixel's performance here might be enough to put you off doing so altogether. The important thing here is that its 2MP front-facing camera performs very well in Hangouts and Skype calls. As you'd expect from a Google device, Hangouts are particularly well supported. GOOGLE PIXEL C FEATURES: CURRENTLY MISSING A FEW SMALL POINTS The Pixel C gets a lot of things right, but if you're keen to use a stylus then you're better off looking at the Surface or the iPad Pro and its Magical Pencil. The speakers aren’t amazing, either - they’re better than most phones, and they’re positioned at either end for proper stereo sound, but they’re a little raspier than the sound from the latest iPad Air. They’re plenty good enough for watching a few episodes of Bojack Horseman while ironing, though. GOOGLE PIXEL C VERDICT At $US599 with keyboard, the Pixel C is cheaper than a keyboard-equipped iPad Pro or Surface Pro 4. Only the Surface 3 can compete on price.  That said, the machines that may have more to learn from this tasty little workhorse aren't necessarily other convertibles, but Chromebooks. They now outsell Windows laptops, but Chromebooks are still growing in popularity because they're simple and affordable. The Pixel C hasn't seen hordes of Android faithful turning in their laptops for tablets, admittedly - but it's still a great tabtop, and continued software updates have kept those early adopters happy.  Related Reviews Review: Google Pixel C Source: Copyright © Stuff.tv See more about:  google pixel c   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   App of the week: TypeShift     Destiny 2 – what we know so far     YouPorn and Pornhub activate HTTPS encryption     Microsoft's customised Galaxy S8 might be the closest you get to a Windows Phone in 2017     Unless 'legally compelled to', Microsoft will not hand over data   NOTE: You must be a registered member of PC & Tech Authority to post a comment.

The tech giant had hoped that upgraded transport links to the White Bay area of Rozelle would be in place quickly so it could shift its offices from Pyrmont. But a proposed metro line around that area is still a decade off being ready - and it seems Google's patience has run out.  Google has scrapped plans to move its Sydney headquarters to an abandoned power station in Sydney's inner west because of the city's poor public transport. Pictured, an artist's impression of the now-scrapped HQ The power plant, which was decommissioned in 1983, has poor transport links to the city 'Ultimately, the complexity of the project and the timing of associated transport infrastructure could not meet Google's requirements at this time,' the New South Wales government said. It added that it still planned to develop the former power plant into a 'technology and innovation hub' - although it turned down 13 $1 million tenders for the 105-year-old building last year.

Share this article Share Google said it had 'mutually agreed' with the government to end plans to move to the site, which was decommissioned as a power station back in 1983. A spokesman for the search engine added that it was still looking to move to a new 'long-term home' in Sydney. Google said it and the government had 'mutually agreed' to end plans to move to the site. Pictured, an artist's impression of the now-scrapped HQ The NSW government still plans to develop the former power station (pictured) into a 'technology and innovation hub' The tech giant had had hoped that upgraded transport links to the White Bay area of Rozelle would be in place quickly so it could shift its offices from Pyrmont (pictured) David Pitchford, the former chief executive of the NSW government's city infrastructure arm UrbanGrowth, previously said development in the area would be a 'disaster' without new transport links. 'In the Bays, there is nowhere near the transport infrastructure that needs to be there,' he said in 2015. Mr Pitchford left the agency late last year. A Google spokesman said: 'We are grateful to the NSW Government and UrbanGrowth NSW for their efforts to deliver on their impressive vision for White Bay Power Station.  'Through the genuine and productive negotiations in the last few months we've come to realise that achieving that vision isn't possible within our timeframe. So we've mutually agreed with UrbanGrowth NSW to discontinue negotiations over the site.  'We remain committed to Australia, to supporting innovation in Sydney and across the country and will continue to liaise with the government to identify an alternative long-term home here in Sydney.'              Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Doctor who was 'knocked out' on flight is bleeding from the face Man forcibly removed from plane because flight was overbooked Video shows Robert Seman from courthouse balcony before trial Second passenger's video of man being ripped off UA flight California man films mountain collapse near cars in Malibu Touching moment a usually mute autistic boy sings Hallelujah US Navy moves the USS Carl Vinson strike group towards Korea Jimmy Kimmel mocks United for dragging passenger off flight Poisonous cobra gives unsuspecting man kiss of death on cheek Shocking moment little boy falls through the gap at train station Moment police officer overtakes cyclist on London road Shocking footage shows drink driver launching over roundabout PICTURED: The internal medicine specialist father-of-five...

After quick updates like the LG G5 Android Nougat release, things have slowed down. Many are excitedly awaiting it to arrive, and here we’ll be going over everything owners need to know. From release schedules, confirmations and more. Including the LG G4 Nougat release. Way back in August last year Google rolled out Android 7.0 Nougat. Since then we’ve seen multiple quick maintenance updates, including 7.1.2 for the Pixel. Those with LG smartphone though, aren’t getting updates as quick. Read: Android 7.1 Nougat vs Android 6.0: What’s New Thanks to an LG Nougat preview program updates have been faster this time around. However, millions of those with an LG G4 or V10 are still waiting. Additionally, some LG G5 owners are still on Marshmallow, and are wondering when they’ll get the latest and greatest software. That and more is detailed below for all LG smartphone owners. Popular smartphones from all major manufacturers will see updates to Android 7.0 in the near future, if not already. Reports have surfaced from Samsung, LG, HTC, Sony and many others. Manufacturers are pushing out Android 7.0 though, and not the latest 7.1.1 release by Google. That will come later this year. Owners with the LG G4, LG G5, LG V10, budget devices and potentially even the older LG G3 will get Android 7.0 Nougat. Some already have. And while LG has been relatively quiet, we’re starting to see more movement. In fact, some benchmark results were spotted with the LG G3 running Nougat. A device that’s nearly two years old. That’s a good sign for owners, but don’t expect it anytime soon. If you have a G4 or V10 though, we have some relatively good news to share. The LG G4 Nougat Update is coming soon With that said, when will your LG device get Android Nougat? We’re not entirely sure, but we have some details worth sharing. Here’s the latest news on LG Android 7.0 Nougat updates, what’s new and more. LG Android 7.0 Nougat Updates The first smartphone to ship with Android 7.0 Nougat was the LG V20. As a result many expected LG to be one of the first for software updates too. On November 8th LG confirmed the LG G5 Android 7.0 update had begun. However, it didn’t arrive for those in the United States until far later, and most didn’t get it until February. A few are even waiting as we’re now in March. On November 8th the LG G5 Android 7.0 update began in Korea. LG confirmed it would soon arrive in the United States, Asia, then continue to other popular markets around the globe. The first update in the United States arrived on November 21st. Beginning with the Sprint LG G5. Several users on Reddit confirmed the news, then eventually Sprint made it official. The T-Mobile LG G5 Android 7.0 Nougat update quickly followed, and then the Verizon LG G5 update kicked off in December. Below is a screenshot confirming the software, November 1st security patch, and the large 1.3GB file. Here’s a screenshot for proof. The T-Mobile LG G5 Android 7.0 update is now available So what about AT&T? They’ve been fast with updates in the past, but that wasn’t the case this time around with the LG G5. AT&T is the last major carrier to send out G5 Nougat updates, which began February 20th. Multiple reports online have confirmed its arrival. Head into Settings > About Phone > and check for updates. Remember, AT&T only allows users to check once per day. Otherwise you’ll need to change the phone date forward and try again. It can take up to two weeks to hit your device, so by now most should have it. Next, LG will continue their efforts on the LG V10 and LG G4. When though, is a complete mystery. Originally we heard February and March, but that obviously didn’t happen. However, we do have new information. Reports from Korea say to expect the LG G4 Android 7.1 Nougat update in Q3, which seems way too late. Same goes for the LG V10, which could see it this summer. These are only rumors though, and we’re expecting LG to get these out within the next 1-2 months at the latest. When we know more we’ll share all the details.  The V20 needs a bug-fixing update too, as it has its fair share of problems with Nougat. Surprisingly, select LG G3 phones have been spotted with Nougat. And while it’s possible it may receive an update, the phone is nearly two years old. Meaning it may only get security and maintenance updates, not the new software. We’ll have to wait and see. What’s New in Android 7.0 Nougat At the top of the page LG owners can find an in-depth breakdown of Android 7.0 Nougat, how it compares to older software and everything that’s new. Of course LG has a lot of changes to the look and feel of our software, but it is a great place to start for owners. As a quick recap, the LG Android 7.0 update will bring improvements across the board. From performance, battery life enhancements, improved split-screen multitasking and other changes. Google has over 50+ changes in Android N. Like faster app installs, which are also smaller, a new JIT compiler, improved graphics and performance with the Vulkan API, and even streamlined notifications with new quick reply controls. Not to mention customizable quick setting tiles and other things. Expect all of that and much more from LG Nougat updates. A big addition to Android announced back at Google IO was “Instant Apps” which enables our devices to install small bits of an app (from a search result or web link) and allow one-time instant app usage. Giving smartphone users an app-like experience without downloading anything or leaving the web. Android just adds what it needs for that moment, and removes it once we’re done with the app. Here is more information on Instant Apps, which is now available for select Nougat devices. Most of this will come with LG’s software skin on top, and closely resemble the sleeker UI we’ve seen on the LG V20. Samsung has TouchWiz, HTC uses Sense UI, etc. Don’t expect everything from Nexus or Pixel devices, but most of Android 7.0 Nougat will soon enhance your LG device. Additionally, the Google Assistant is rolling out to any and all smartphones on Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat. It should be on most phones by now, or soon. Final Thoughts As of today the LG V20 and LG G5 are the only LG devices on Android Nougat. Others will follow in the near future. Now that the final US carrier is sending out Nougat to the LG G5, we should start to hear more about the V10 and G4 from 2016. We know they are next, it’s just a matter of when. Hopefully the Q3 launch rumor is wrong. It’s worth nothing that most of LG’s updates have arrived in February or March the year after Google releases an update. Like The LG G3 Android 5.0 update arrived March a few years back. Considering the G5 was in December the company is a few months ahead of schedule. If that’s anything to go by we could see LG G4 Nougat updates in April. Stay tuned for more details, and we’ll update the moment we know more. 10 Responses 11/09/2016 Danny Jacobovitz Reply I’d be happy if my 2 devices running Marshmallow would get update 6.0.1! There are bluetooth bugs in 6.0.0 that make using the phone with things like Tile useless… 02/21/2017 Sarmad Reply Is LG x screen going to get Android 7? 02/25/2017 RAGG Reply Still waiting for LG G4 update. No release date has been published. I the meanwhile, a lot of phones are having the update. This may become a marketing promo for future updates. A promise to keep the phone updates as soon as possible. If not, customers may consider other phone options at purshase time.

Will Android 7.0 be available for this too? 04/05/2017 Konar Kunte Reply Android 7.0 was officially released on August 22, 2016 . Today, after almost 1 Year 2.8% of all mobile, running the almost 1 year old Operating system. LG update policy sucks! As spoken, after around 1 year after the Release, LG wasn’t able to upgrade my 1 Year old V10 to the next Version . Without looking into the amount of kernel bugs, security overall, this was my LAST LG Android Mobile. https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/180113/umfrage/anteil-der-verschiedenen-android-versionen-auf-geraeten-mit-android-os/ 04/11/2017 sean Reply i am still waiting LG i am using a lg g4 h815 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Security Systems-on-a-chip are a huge, unaudited attack surface, says Project Zero's Wi‑Fi attack man What goes on when chip components chat? Nobody cares. But they should 12 Apr 2017 at 01:03, Richard Chirgwin The internal inter-chip communications of devices like smartphones are a “huge, mostly unaudited attack surface,” according to Gal Beniamini of Google’s Project Zero, in his promised follow-up to last week’s demonstration of how to attack Wi‑Fi chips over the air. His April 4 “part one” prompted emergency patches from Apple and Google, new drivers from Broadcom and a lot of scratched heads about which other devices use the FullMAC system-on-chip (SoC) devices. Beniamini calls for better memory isolation between SoCs and the host processors, along with exploit mitigations like stack cookies, to protect devices against Wi‑Fi-borne attacks. Beniamini’s first post only got as far as remote code execution on the Wi‑Fi chip itself, but at the time he said there are paths from the SoC up to the application processor. He's now detailed those issues in 8,300 words of gory detail here. If you don’t have much time, Beniamini found both low-level (the easy way) and high-level (the hard way) communication paths that made the application processor attackable: The “easy way” is to attack the communications channel that links the SoC to the application processor. The “hard way” is to attack high-level messages the SoC passes to signal important Wi‑Fi events to the host (such as SSID discovery, Wi‑Fi power level and so on). The Register is going to take the liberty of detailing the “easy way” first, reversing the order of Beniamini’s post. "The utilisation of hardware components remains as it is, and is currently not mitigated against." The link from the SoC to the host SoCs support a bunch of different upstream interfaces – Beniamini lists the mostly obsolete SDIO along with USB and PCIe. PCIe is the fastest, it uses DMA (direct memory access) to talk to the processor, and since it’s becoming the default in modern devices, that’s the one Beniamini chose to attack. After a fair bit of stack trace work to untangle the communication protocols the Broadcom SoC uses to talk to the host, he found a spot where the SoC “managed to DMA into the physical address range containing the host’s kernel, without any interference” (among other things indicating either a lack of a system memory mapping unit or a configuration error). Broadcom’s SoftMAC driver brcmsmac revealed to the researchers how to map out the SoC’s DMA access and identify which structures represent host-to-device and device-to-host accesses. That provided a path to “hijack any kernel function with our own crafted data” – in other words, complete pwnage of the kernel. The hard way Beniamini’s “hard way,” actually his first line of research, was to look at how the SoC signals things like “SSID available” or Wi‑Fi power level to the host. What he found is that such control messages all use the same EtherType, 0x886C, which encapsulates “information about firmware events which must be handled by the host’s driver.” 0x886C frames were unfiltered until last May, but there are two problems with this: if you pwn the SoC, you can revert that patch; and the WLC_E_PFN_SWC event that signals “significant Wi‑Fi change” (one of 144 possible, of which the Broadcom Android driver supports 35 – a genuinely huge attack surface) is still attackable. Android’s April bulletin fixed five such holes that Beniamini discovered during his research. The WLC_E_PFN_SWC work revealed an unchecked, untrusted array, meaning “an attacker with the ability to inject arbitrary event frames can specify a small total_count and a larger pkt_count, thereby triggering a simple kernel heap overflow.” The reason Beniamini set aside this line of work is that while the vulnerability is genuine, it would have been “tedious” to write a reliable exploit (he should know, given the amount of work needed to get through to a kernel crash). Beniamini’s how-to for pwning the Wi‑Fi processor is here, and our summary is here. ® Tips and corrections 1 Comment MORE Apple Broadcom Smartphone Android More from The Register Apple accused of counter-revolutionary pricing in Russia Tovarishch Cook accused of sending retailers to gulag unless they follow price list 6 Comments Apple fans, Android world scramble to patch Broadcom's nasty drive-by Wi-Fi security hole Grab firmware updates ASAP 46 Comments Silver Lake and Broadcom bid $18bn for Tosh memory biz US memory-buying partnership arrives out of the blue Russia to convicted criminal hackers: 'Work with us or jail?'

The company said it conducts “rigorous analyses” that its pay practices are gender-blind and found “no gender pay gap” in 52 major job categories it analyzed last year. The Department of Labor had accused Google of shortchanging women doing similar work to men, saying it found “systemic compensation disparities” across the company’s workforce.

Qualcomm fires back at Apple An acrimonious legal battle between Apple and Qualcomm is threatening a relationship that helped both companies rake in billions of dollars as leaders of the smartphone revolution. Qualcomm filed a countersuit late Monday, saying Apple was trying to profit from its patented technology without paying up. Qualcomm risks losing a big portion of the revenue it gets from one of its biggest customers. For Apple, it suggests doubt about the iPhone’s ability to remain a prestige product without the chipmaker’s wireless technology. Apple sold $137 billion worth of iPhones in its most recent fiscal year. But in 2016, iPhone unit shipments dropped for the first time, making the company focus more on profitability. Apple pressured suppliers more to save money, and its battle with Qualcomm is the toughest of these tense negotiations. “Apple has built the most profitable company in the world, relying heavily on Qualcomm’s patented technologies,” Qualcomm wrote in the court filing. “Apple achieved its success without contributing much, if anything, to the innovations at the heart of cellular communications.” Apple says Qualcomm is abusing its strength as the major provider of smartphone chips and related patents to suppress competition and extract billions of dollars in licensing fees it doesn’t deserve. Deals RetailMeNot acquired Direct mail and marketing services company Harland Clark Holdings is buying online coupon company RetailMeNot. Harland Clark is paying $11.60 per share for RetailMeNot, a 50 percent premium on the Austin, Texas, company’s closing stock price of $7.75 on Monday. The deal is valued at about $560 million; including debt, the value of stock options and convertible securities, it’s worth $630 million. RetailMeNot’s shares soared Tuesday to hover near the deal price. Harland Clarke is a subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Inc., an investment firm headed by Ronald Perelman. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter. Chronicle News Services Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Radio Sputnik’s Loud and Clear spoke with Dr. Robert Epstein from the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology about this feature and the dangerous implications of corporations having the power to define reality. Epstein explained that Google has long been experimenting with different ways by which it can manipulate search results, even before the concept of fake news became popular during the last election. ​"Google has tried many ways to control those efforts and they’ve been really moving away from the idea of just looking at the popularity of sites and moving into the direction of actually trying to figure out what’s valid and what isn’t, what’s true and what isn’t," he said. "And that’s a very different kind of task than simply looking at popularity or counting links to a website." He added, "So they’ve been getting into the game of judging truth, and in my opinion that’s extremely dangerous." While systematically filtering false information seems like a positive thing on its face, Epstein explained that the issue lies in for-profit entities determining what is true and what isn’t. "What’s happening now, very rapidly, is that some of the big tech companies, Google being the leader, are saying 'we’re going to figure this out.' And the crazy part of that is, they’re not saying they’re assembling a team of analysts and journalists and Nobel Prize winners to figure this out, no. What they’re saying is 'we’ve developed an algorithm that’s going to figure it out.'"  © AFP 2017/ Philippe Huguen Google's New Fact Checker Aims to Stamp Out Fake News 'Before it Causes Trouble' Loud and Clear host Brian Becker asked, "What are some of the markers that the algorithms would look for? What are the discerning pieces to the fake news/real news truth versus non-truth puzzle?" Epstein says this is unclear, because "We’re not dealing with some open source, public kind of enterprise, we’re dealing with a rapacious private corporation that is highly secretive. So we can only guess what their criteria will be because they’re not going to announce them in any detail. So that makes this even worse." Becker recalled the United Nations listing internet access as a fundamental human right, on par with water, shelter and food, commenting that "If this internet is privately controlled by these giant mega-corporations that are driven fundamentally by profits, and they can be the determiners without account, it seems to be a fundamental negation of any semblance of democracy."  © AP Photo/ Google Fact-Checking Tool Worse Than Censorship - French Activist Epstein agreed, and said that internet pioneers envisioned a level playing field where people would be able to explore and express themselves without boundaries, but the exact opposite has happened. He said, "What has happened is the internet is not a free-for-all where everyone has access and equal say, in fact it is an environment dominated overwhelmingly by one major company with a couple of other big companies having some say as well, but that is not what it was supposed to be and this move now by Google and to some extent Facebook, to decide what’s real news and what isn’t, that is really scary. That is making this corporate dominance even more frightening and even more dangerous." ...

Therefore unless we are able to prove each words using the words correctly defined in the official dictionary of the language any news story become fake news. Even more, as the story is reported by a human, and the human is imperfect and emotionally biased, any story correctly reported is by definition fake news. Conclusion: Use internet for what it was originally designed: allowing universities and research dept to share knowledge. As long as money is present in the internet, fake news will be there as fake news rise the media and brings money....

Specifically, the tweet says to “watch out for the next Nougat update,” suggesting that the feature(s) should be coming relatively soon… Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services We obviously don’t have easy access to a Pixel device running in India… on Jio, so we can’t confirm this for ourselves. But while the tweet is vague there is a bit of information floating around that can clarify things for us. Telecomtalk.info reports that VoLTE actually came to the Pixel on Jio back in December, and that this forthcoming Nougat update will enable WiFi calling. Essentially, this will mean that users on Jio who don’t have great cellular service but do have a decent WiFi connection will be able to make calls from their Jio phone number even in those low-reception areas. Keep an eye out for the update coming soon.

(AAP) The NSW government's plan to create a Silicon-Valley in inner-Sydney "lies in a smoking ruin" after Google decided not to base it's new headquarters there, the state opposition leader says. Luke Foley says the plans, originally proposed by former premier Mike Baird, to transform rundown areas in White Bay, Glebe Island and Rozelle into a tech hub were an "utter shambles". "All the plans that have been touted by the government, today lie in a smoking ruin," he said on Wednesday. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the government was still working closely with Google to find a more appropriate location for the tech giant. "They are actually looking at a number of sites ... certainly they are looking to increase the size of their workforce here which is welcome news to me," Ms Berejiklian said. Google, currently based in Pyrmont, said the government's planned upgrades to the precinct wouldn't be completed in time to accommodate the company. "Through the genuine and productive negotiations in the last few months we've come to realise that achieving that vision isn't possible within our time frame," a Google spokesman said. Ms Berejiklian said she understood short-term solutions to public transport were necessary for a prospective tech company to base itself in the area and her government had plans to solve the transport issues. She refused to give specific details. Mr Foley said overall he supported the move to transform the areas but it needed better short-term plans for increasing accessibility, such as reopening a pedestrian bridge at Glebe Island. © AAP 2017 New South Wales Politics Technology TRENDING VIDEO Ashton Kutcher addresses Demi Moore rumours and praises Mila Kunis Ashton Kutcher is a Hollywood leading man, tech entrepreneur, husband, and father-of-two, and as he shared recently, there are several key experiences that got him where he is today.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google hopes the latest addition to its Chrome browser will make reading web sites less frustrating. The tool, called scroll anchoring, will prevent web sites from bouncing users up and down the screen. As Google explains, "annoying page jumps typically happen when the web site inserts an image or other content above the visible area, pushing down what’s on the screen." The result is often grating, as it forces people to navigate back to where they were on the screen to continue reading or viewing. "Scroll anchoring locks the content you’re currently looking at to the screen, keeping you in the same spot so you can keep reading," says Google. Google suggests web developers check out the technical details on its developer web site. Google didn't specify exactly which version of Chrome carries the new feature. Chrome is free to download from the Google Play Store and is preinstalled on most Android handsets. more info at Google » Related Google news Android news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

See Offers Business Posted Yesterday at 7:36 PM Updated April 11 increase font size Google to federal accuser: No gender pay gap found in our analyses But the U.S. government thinks otherwise, possibly because of the way each side defines 'similar job.' By BARBARA ORTUTAYAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article Google said it’s “taken aback ” by the government’s claim that it doesn’t compensate women fairly. The company said it conducts “rigorous analyses” that its pay practices are gender-blind and found “no gender pay gap” in 52 major job categories it analyzed last year. Google noted that analysts who calculate suggested pay don’t have access to employees’ gender data. Google also said that beyond gender pay equity, the company recently expanded the analysis to cover race in the U.S. as well. The U.S. Department of Labor had accused Google of shortchanging women doing similar work to men, saying it found “systemic compensation disparities” across the company’s workforce. Google responded in a blog post Tuesday that the department’s assertion “came without any supporting data or methodology.” The company said it had already produced hundreds of thousands of documents in response to 18 separate requests, and the government is seeking thousands more, including contact details of employees. The department had no comment, saying the case is ongoing. The difference between Google’s and the Labor Department’s claims might come down to how each side defines pay discrimination, Tim Worstall, a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute in London, wrote in a recent post for Forbes. “Google is using a strict definition of ‘same job’ to find no gender pay gap. The Department of Labor is using a looser definition of ‘similar job’ to find that there is one,” he wrote. “Who you think is right here is entirely up to you, but that’s where the disagreement is.” Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

For a company with totally unremarkable diversity numbers, Google is weirdly nonspecific about how it addresses pay inequity in the post, saying both that it doesn't underpay women, but won't support having a third-party certify that. Just a trustworthy bunch of fellas. (Photo: AP) The allegations date back to January, when the Department of Labor filed suit against Google for employment income data as part of a federally mandated review to make sure women and men are paid the same at the company. Since September, Google has repeatedly refused to give the agency the data, claiming that the request violates employee privacy and that Google's own internal audits found no pay discrimination. The Department of Labor, however, asserts that women are grossly underpaid compared to men at the company. Janet Herold, a solicitor for the agency, told The Guardian that the government's preliminary investigation found that "discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry". If Google continues withholding the data, they risk losing all US federal contracts and being barred from all future federal work until they hand it over. Regardless, Google isn't budging, claiming that the government couldn't possibly have discovered a pay disparity because it has incomplete records — the entirety of which Google refuses to hand over. Tuesday's (only slightly passive aggressive) blog post reads: We were taken aback by this assertion, which came without any supporting data or methodology. The [Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs] representative claimed to have reached this conclusion even as the OFCCP is seeking thousands of employee records, including contact details of our employees, in addition to the hundreds of thousands of documents we've already produced in response to 18 different document requests. But Google's methodology for calculating employee compensation is not "gender blind" as it cringingly asserts. According to the blog post, employee compensation is suggested by a number of factors, including "current and recent performance ratings". Although salary is calculated by analysts who can't see employee gender, they factor in performance ratings which themselves are subjective and shaped by biases. Google also acknowledges that managers have "limited discretion to adjust" the final compensation level that analysts suggest. It's almost ridiculous to assert that gender plays absolutely no part in performance or ratings when there's such an enormous gender disparity at the company, with an 80 per cent male tech labour force. Wouldn't that play out in performance ratings? How does Google audit performance ratings for gender bias? How do they know such heavily skewed environments don't affect performance in the first place? The company hasn't answered these questions and according to the Department of Labor, Google's problems are systemic, not incidental. Obviously, the problem is much bigger than just Google. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which files suit against discriminating companies, will start collecting data on income and gender in 2018 to identify wage gaps. Given the rampant problems of sexism in tech, even among feminist-identifying companies, there are many more legal battles (and awkward PR pivots like this) to come.

From its inception in 2007 as a mostly-fibre network to the multi-technology mix of 2017, it's evolved into a Byzantine mess both for customers to understand and for internet service providers to manage. The main pain point is congestion -- a lack of virtual capacity on the network that slows some connections to a crawl. It's bad enough that some smaller ISPs are provisioning their own networks rather than relying on existing backhaul from NBN and their own competitors.

Photo: UrbanGrowth NSW/ YouTube. Google has walked away from plans to turn a disused power station 2km from the CBD, into its new Australian headquarters in a major blow to the NSW’s government’s $20 billion “Bays Precinct” redevelopment of 95 hectares of waterfront land on Sydney Harbour. The global tech giant spent more than 18 months in negotiations with the state government’s developer, UrbanGrowth NSW, about taking over the heritage–listed White Bay power station – currently a rusted shell including two disused chimney stacks beside the Anzac Bridge, west of the CBD, after former premier Mike Baird flagged turning the area, which includes 10 hectares industrial waterfront land, into a tech hub. But Sydney’s traffic woes appear to have killed off the idea, with the government admitting that it could not deliver the infrastructure Google required in time. “Ultimately, the complexity of the project and the timing of associated transport infrastructure could not meet Google’s requirements at this time,” a government spokesperson said. The Anzac Bridge is often choked with traffic and the turnoff that would lead to the site is often banked back to halfway across the bridge. Plans for a metro rail line to the area are still more than a decade away. The option of a ferry service to the Blackwattle Bay area from Circular Quay has not been flagged, despite increased residential density at sites such as the former Harold Park paceway in recent years. A number of community leaders, from former Leichhardt mayor Darcy Byrne to the former CEO of Urbangrowth NSW have repeatedly warned that public transport infrastructure was essential to any redevelopment. The government has instead focussed on delivering more road infrastructure, but the timeline for public transport improvements would mean the site would be surrounded by construction work. An artist’s impression for the Glebe Island tech park. Google said it was still committed to finding a new “long-term” HQ in Sydney, which is believed to be up to 100,000 square metres, but abandoned talks with Urbangrowth NSW by mutual agreement. “We are grateful to the NSW government and UrbanGrowth NSW for their efforts to deliver on their impressive vision for White Bay power station,” a spokesperson said. “Through the genuine and productive negotiations in the last few months we’ve come to realise that achieving that vision isn’t possible within our timeframe. We remain committed to Australia, to supporting innovation in Sydney and across the country and will continue to liaise with the government to identify an alternative long-term home here in Sydney.” Google currently has its Australian headquarters at Darling Island, Pyrmont. It maintains a sales force in Sydney as well as an engineering division, which was most famously responsible for the creation of Google Maps. Losing Google as the signature tenant at the White Bay station puts its future in doubt as a tech hub after the government already knocked back more than a dozen proposals for the site, including one from Lendlease. Photo: Supplied After calling for submissions from the private sector in 2015, the NSW government and planning minister Rob Stokes rejected all 13 proposals they received, instead appointing the government’s property developer UrbanGrowth NSW as master developer of the precinct. UrbanGrowth NSW chairman John Brogden said at the time that none of the proposals complied with the government’s wishes. Former premier Mike Baird said he wanted transform the old power station into “a global centre for hi-tech jobs and innovation” for “global giants of technology and innovation cluster and connect with start-up entrepreneurs, business incubators and accelerators”. At the time the premier sold off the Australian Technology Park in Redfern to a consortium led by the Commonwealth Bank, which is consolidating its operations from Parramatta in western Sydney on the inner city site. A bid by Australian tech giant Atlasssian to take control of the site was rejected by the government. “The NSW government under Gladys Berejiklian said it remains committed to turning White Bay into a tech hub,” an Urbangrowth NSW spokesperson said. “Given the iconic nature of White Bay Power Station and its significance to Sydney, we will continue with our methodical and considered approach to its redevelopment. “Later this year, UrbanGrowth NSW will be commemorating the site’s centenary of operations and will release further information in due course.” Follow Business Insider Australia on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 134 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares270 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company. I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

Indian Yes we guessed him to be the new man by reading his name, Trevor "Newman" Marcie Mtz Good article...But it's "couldn't care less". chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine CF542 6 months? I replaced my S7E three times in four months for chronic and various problems before giving up and going Pixel blueman24 "Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES." "I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge" "Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months." You brought a $700 S7edge and not a $300 oneplus, so it should not be acceptable for it to become less responsive after 6 months? Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. WARLORD VIII On the up side the Pixel isn't catching on fire 😎 das I thought that was a feature for survivalists. :P Eric Works for me. The most stable software wise of any phone I've ever used. Paid 300 for mine and prefer it over the s7. Curved screens don't like screen protector. Nothing like water resistant on a phone that looks like a cat danced on it. Another huge plus is the lack of carrier spam. I'm not getting all the complaints. Google showed us we'd be getting if we choose to buy it. I for one have no regrets about doing so. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. Kristian Ivanov I'm not going to comment on the actual design, I want to hear thoughts comparing it to the undesputed legend - Nexus 5 (design only) JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. CF542 The only thing that the S7/S8 truly suffer from is having Samsung as a parent. They turned the phone (s) into a piece of bloatware full of crappy software that nobody wants. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Ryan Those are usability preferences. I will agree the settings are a freaking nightmare to find, but I dont go into settings often. Right now, and for over a year now, bluetooth audio has been straight-up broken. They implemented that absoloute volume BS without coding how to handle devices that dont send volume information, breaking it in my car. Then the idiots put developer setting that is to allow you to disable it but they didnt even test it and the user doesnt have permissions to change that setting, so the switch does nothing. That is a BIG bug, and one that Google has refused to address for over a year. Then there is the fact that my phone, and the first Nexus phone I have had to deal with this on, has to be rebooted every few weeks because it slows down horribly. Jack Smith Based on what? Had every iPhone since the 3G and relatively recently added Android as carry both and Android is excellent. So much is written is just simply not true. Suggest actually give recent Android a try and you might be surprised ;). Ryan Ive had android for coming up on 8 years, HTC Hero was the first, then one more HTC before going Nexus. Been on Nexus and still am with my 5x. I know, personally, some of the MAJOR shortcomings of Googles implementation of Android. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. ScratchC The problem with the Internet is how do I know you actually own one? Or are you just a troll. In any case, I unfortunately had to pass on the Pixel my S6 shit the bed and I had just upgraded to the S7. My gf tho.. I somehow convinced her to grab a Pixel on Verizon. She has not had not 1 issue. I'm not saying they don't exist. It's just not as bad as commenters trying to win an argument make it seem. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of the 22 Pixel photos had halos. None of the LG G6 photos had halos. whispy_snippet Wow. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. Vega007 My Pixel is, by far, the best phone I have ever had for battery life. Christopher Bement I'm only going with devices I've actually used, I haven't touched a Pixel personally. All I can say is it's day and night between the N6 and S7 on a given work day where I'm calling, texting and emailing almost constantly. Vega007 That's a good point, it all depends on what phone we have used to compare it to. I have never used a S7 Edge, but I have used a S7. While the battery life was fine, the Pixel does do better for my usage (I'm using the 5" btw). And that's the real key to battery issue is personal use. We all use our devices differently so battery life will always be subjective. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. ScratchC The iPhone has been in trouble for some time. It's why it started playing catch up (Forget current sales up to now. Poll after poll, iPhone users are bored of iPhones) Actually Google's Android is in trouble as well. Samsung is doing their own thing. Google needs to put it's foot down or compete. The Pixel is an attempt to do so. It's not perfect by any means. it's better than nothing and it was a solid first entry. If you simply don't like it.. Buy elsewhere. that's the beauty of Android. I think you guys forget, that out of our fanboy bubble, most people when they think of Android have a distinct definition. I'm talking the average consumer...they think Android = cheap phone from prepaid carrier that's slow, plastic, horrible camera & full of bugs. Or.. Android = Samsung Galaxy. Your average consumer still doesn't know what a Pixel is nvm that they don't even know what a Nexus was. Android phones need to be a premium product to compete. They need to charge the amount of money it takes for proper R&D.. Customer support etc. Google cannot sell at a loss and accomplish this. This very reason is why Samsung holds the Android crown. Regardless of your opinion towards their devices. Remember that Carrier subsidizing is how Galaxy devices sell by the millions. Iphones as well. Google is on the right path. They just need to bring the next Pixel to all carriers. Lindsay Meyer You're right. I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved those iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices), and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick (and their new iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to throw my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability, and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. mrjayviper Fairly new? How long have they been selling Nexus phones and other devices? MJ Let me get this straight... You left a comment without reading the whole discussion? I already very clearly laid out an actual argument but thanks for your input. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. madcanada That's correct, I'm pissed that Pixel gets a better camera software while Nexus is fundamentally the same in the department. I understand your point about camera being a combination of both hardware and software, but unlike, say, Apple, where each iteration is actually better in terms of hardware, and older iPhones still get whatever features they can physically run, Google decided to accentuate the difference by simply denying their last year phone the same updates. Where Apple only denies updates when the old phone can't actually handle them Google is simply abandoning their last year model to justify the price of the Pixel. whispy_snippet Except there's one key difference. Unlike iPhones that release each year, the Nexus 6P is not of the Pixel lineage. The Pixel is the first of its kind. madcanada That makes not a shred of difference in the argument I'm making. I find denying last year phone updates it perfectly capable of running, so you can justify the price of the new phone ethically questionable. I don't care if they rebranded, their decision to not give Nexus the updates it can handle is only guided by the fact that they wanted to charge twice the price for Pixel, and they couldn't have if Nexus got the goodies. whispy_snippet Ethically questionable? No, mate, it's business. Google's ultimate responsibility is maximising profits for shareholders. You're cranky that your 6P can't do what the more expensive a Pixel can do. Now imagine how Pixel owners would feel if they saw cheaper, older phones from the same company doing exactly the same thing as theirs. Again, I sympathise to an extent, but ultimately you get what you pay for. If you want the Pixel experience, buy it. madcanada I'm not cranky because my Nexus 6P can't do things Pixel can, on the contrary, I get full Pixel experience with free unlimited full size photo upload, Pixel launcher, Pixel camera, and day one Google Assistant on Nexus 6P. I'm cranky because I need to go to XDA to get them goodies. I understand it's business, but if you want to sell charge twice for the phone - sell a better phone, give us a better camera, bigger battery life, and don't downgrade our goddamn speakers. whispy_snippet Mate, you're simply not making sense anymore. You're effectively wanting something for nothing. You want Google to give you a Pixel quality camera experience on an older, less expensive phone from an entirely different lineage - for free. You're not entitled to free stuff. I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree. madcanada you can disagree all your want, i outlined my gripe with Google in the first post, then you decided to argue about the camera. New lineage or not, when you market Nexus as the phone that gets all the Google love, and then you just leave users behind right next generation simply to justify the price hike of new Pixel - that's low. Apple's feature fragmentation is driven solely by the hardware - newer phones get new exclusive features because older models can't do the same thing physically. Google is creating artificial fragmentation in order to justify twice the price. That's not the Google I remember and that's not the direction I like. Obviously it's their choice. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? Mix Sounds like you have not done this before because sending your phone to Google first, waiting for them to get it and look it over THEN sending a replacement is, 100%, the bad choice. Having them send you the phone first and put a hold on your creditcard is the better and faster choice! Complaining gets you nothing, USA got free daydream headsets, Canadians got nothing. The phone, after taxes, was $1,320.48 - close enough for me to complain about it at the $1,400 point, lol. John Doe OMG, YOU CAN'T READ? That is what I said Google does but you said you had to wait 7 days for your phone but they send you the phone first then you send yours in so no waiting. Yes I have done this before. With Apple, Google, and other companies...it is standard practice. No, they don't charge you taxes they just put a hold of the price of the phone not your total purchase price. Maybe it is just different in Canada...you should stop buying Google products there *rolls eyes* Lindsay Meyer If your damaged, soon-to-be-returned Pixel phone is broken and unusable, there would indeed be a waiting period to have a working phone in either case, because, being unable to easily switch your device at a physical brick and mortar store, you would be at the mercy of waiting for for Google's mailed replacement to have a working phone again. John Doe Google sens it next day here in the US Mix You straight up told me that I chose the bad option: "Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault." when I did not choose the bad option. If my phone bricked, which it did, and it takes 7 days for Googles phone to get to me I have no phone for 7 days, that is waiting without a phone! I think we are both right, 12 of this and a dozen of that, lol. <3 Stuff in Canada is more expensive and shipping generally sucks. I normally chose 2 day shipping with Amazon and get refunded shipping costs because the shipping companies miss the delivery date constantly. Nexus 4 and 5 have been sweet, my Pixel experience has been garbage. Their customer service has been good though so yay for that. Lindsay Meyer Canadian $ ≠ US $ John Doe Yeah but the phone still does not cost $1,400 in canada so yeah destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I'd far rather spend 5-10 minutes online from home getting my replacement shipped to me for free than having to go into a store, talk to someone who's less knowledgeable about my phone than I am, convince them to get it replaced, and then pay them an additional $35 to have them facilitate my phone then getting shipped to their store where I have to return to pick it up. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. Aaron Yeah, top notch. Tell that to all those iPhone 6plus users with the death screen disease and Apple does nothing... mrjayviper Out of warranty? I don't think Google supports out of warranty devices to donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. Berni Hargrove Hold on now, Chromebooks are more than good enough if you go price for price on a cheap laptop. There's no way that $200 Windows laptop with 2gigs of ram is performing on the same level as a $200 Chromebook with the same specs. In addition the reason why "Good Enough" applies to this is because the average person wants to pay very little for a computer, but have it be "fast and last a long time" to effectively browse and use Office. Anyone here should know, unless you are getting over on someone, the least you should pay for decent laptop is $500, but the amount of times I've had people in Best Buy whine that that's too expensive for them to just be using Office and small tasks is frequent. Google can make good products that are ready for primetime when they don't have their ass or in the clouds, but sadly as their messaging strategy has showed us, that's increasingly uncommon. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal. Roy https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fef4fa148cb6b5c2f15fcd856ec70e90ed88abb6606e0f6554b4d09654040535.png Max Johnson X-tra Bezel. Eric Marciniak Doesn't help that Best Buy has a giant iPhone 7 ad that literally blocks the pixel display from view right when you walk in haha. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8283702e9d03a34df4cfb2bd525ea593d0304d3937690392b7b3acc57eb7620e.jpg Berni Hargrove Best Buy is terrible with product placement. Shit literally changes every season if not more. Good luck finding anything remotely niche on your own. lol Jon E. Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. Berni Hargrove While I agree with a lot of what you said, some of your logic is flawed. Take america for example. There's over 150 million people here. It would take at least 15 million in sales here alone, just to see 1 in 10 people with it. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers. C Lo Good first article Trevor. Welcome aboard. Suyash Bansal I liked the article. 🙃 Orjuan Google Pixels customer service is great if you ask me. It takes like a week to get a replacement, not a month. Also, comparing it to the One Plus 3T is unfair, you didn't mention the superior processing and graphical power and the fact that it gets updates for the next 5-8 years. It also features Google Assistant, which is a big selling point. Add all those up and pixel is worth the extra 400. Plus, I got a regular pixel, with a two year protection plan, 128 GB, and it's still cheaper than iPhone. Google Pixel is a commercial and consumer success. Do your research before spouting out shit, all you did was look at the obvious facts and ignored the small stuff that counts. "UGHHHHH, it has a better camera and that's it.". RESEARCH YOUR TOPICS, Google Pixel is $400 more than One Plus 3T because it's better! Orjuan Plus, Nexus was barely Google at all, they just supplied the best version of Android while hiring an OEM to make the parts and design, while slapping their logo on it. Nexus was good, but not Google's essence, it was a startup for Pixel, which is 100% Google. AJZ16 couldn't care less* usamaisawake I had an entire column of pixels that were not working properly. Thing is my Pixel arrived in the first shipment and I had to leave the country so I didn't umbox it until 4 weeks later. When I called to let them know, they were curious why I waited so long and I explained I hadn't turned it on till just then. They didn't give me any trouble with it and exchanged it right away. They sent the new phone and then after I received it I shipped the old back to them. Perhaps this was still early in the release of the phone so they felt more obligated to make sure the experience was good. Phil Rowley My pixel bricked. I thought Google's customer service (along with bestbuy even though I paid for their stupid geek squad) were horrible. I hate to say it but Verizon was the most helpful and luckily I pay for their monthly insurance. Colin Richardson I miss the Nexus line.. Thankfully I can still buy some Nexus 5X phones (not refurbished). But that will not last. I have no idea what I will do for a phone after that.. I want a Stock Android phone, not a Stock Android Flagship phone. Max Johnson There are plenty of stock-like flagship and non-flagship Android phones. HTC, Sony, Moto and OnePlus are all stock based at varying prices. If you want direct update from Google and good customer service that's a different story, I think that's the main thing now, to get the same quality of support as Apple on Android. I'm surprised to get frequently updates from Sony with latest monthly security patches on my X Compact. Micah T "couldn't* care less." Think about it.... Tr3ple I bought a Pixel XL for 370 and I threw my Galaxy S7 edge in the drawer LMAO 😂 oh Happy day. Sammy Phillips 370 USD? or 370 Euro? Tr3ple USD, bought it 220 with a broken screen and fixed it for 150. So I spent 370. mtz Interesting article however, in the same way Microsoft is not really trying to sell the overpriced Surface Studio , Google is not trying to sell Pixels. Why? Simple. Goole has OEM partners that have supported the Android platform by providing the hardware from the beginning. While it one thing for Google to partner with a carrier each year and release a basic Nexus phone its an entirely different thing for them to release top tier Device and undercut thoes partners on price. Tony Bundy Replied via non-existent really blue Pixel. Yes, wasn't easy but here I am. 😀 Pixel.ization.alism Well precisely Google Blue would be #4285F4 not #4485ED if you would ask. Zuxs13 This was a rather poor opinion piece. You make claims like you can't "easily get a replacement pixel" which is completely untrue. The Apple store is hardly the only place that sells phones and offers good customer service. The OP3T might be readily available, but most consumers have no clue what it is or where to even buy one and would rather buy a phone that is sold at their service provider or local best buy and is supported by 24/hr support service. das "Couldn't care less" - if one *could* care less, than it currently cares. Lindsay Meyer I mentioned this in another thread but feel it probably merits its own post here, coming from the perspective of a disenchanted iPhone user who now owns a Pixel (and is still disenchanted). I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved the iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices) and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick, or worse, new packaging on the same lipstick (and their upgraded iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to hurl my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's kind of a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have more innovative features, but Apple with come right behind it and perfect those features. That's what they do now. Still glad I didn't get the iPhone 7; Apple didn't deserve my business, but Pixel has been a disappointment to me thus far. For the price, I'd prefer my husband's Nexus 6. I think he'd prefer his old HTC if it had front-facing speakers lol. I just don't feel there's a lot of good options out there right now that justify the cost. I have given serious thought to trying to find a replacement comparable to the old Sanyo 6100 (yes, that one) and then throwing an iPad or a tablet in my purse. Maybe even that old B&O phone would be fun. I'm just tired of my need for a smartphone to be continually exploited by these inferior products; half the time they break right after the warranty expires, and like an endentured servant, I'm forced into the process all over again. Also, the fact that this Pixel wants to track everything I do scares the bejeezus out of me. I'm sure Apple has done the same thing more covertly for years, but seeing everything I say, type, search, view, read.. not to mention every place I eat at, travel to or shop.. neatly organized into a little packaged profile makes me feel like a product more than ever. Eliminating Google's permissions to track this info also eliminates much of the Pixel's functionality as a smart phone with fluid communication between apps. I should have probably mentioned this first because I absolutely hate that aspect of it. Renee Looker I don't know about anyone else's opinion on the Pixel phone but I have the Pixel XL Blue and have had it since release. I've not had any issues with my phone, absolutely love it. Really quite eager to see what Google will be releasing next, the rumors are on the rise on what's up next. Nicholas Conrad Great article! techieland You and we are the customers when it come to the Pixel and Pixel Xl. And even the late and great Nexus products to some extent. Personally I think the Pixel phones were a fail, Google should have stuck to making reference level phones to ensure the manufacturers understand what the minimum an Android phone is supposed to be like. Samsung and OnePlus obviously gets it but it seems LG, HTC, & Motorola, are struggling despite all 3 being manufacturers of Nexus/AOSP devices. sgtguthrie *couldn't care less Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 142k 105k Latest Deals 2 [Deal Alert] Order an Amazon gift card valued at $25 or more through Alexa and get a $5 promo credit 2017/04/11 3:50pm PDTApr 11, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Verizon BlackBerry Priv for $259.99 on eBay 2017/04/11 12:35pm PDTApr 11, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Amazon's Gold Box deal has a SanDisk MicroSD 256GB for $120 and a 128GB dual USB-C/A drive for $39 2017/04/11 4:46am PDTApr 11, 2017 35 [Update: Added some more] Deal Alert: Here are some more temporarily free apps and games for your Sunday 2017/04/09 3:05pm PDTApr 9, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Gen LTE for $179.99 ($220 off) on eBay 2017/04/08 7:15pm PDTApr 8, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Germain Apr 11, 2017 1:52 PM PT Kingsoft on Tuesday announced that it has expanded its WPS Office suite to include WPS Cloud. The upgrade enables users to work in a cross-platform office suite environment with added storage, file roaming and sharing capabilities. The cloud-enhanced version is available for PCs and mobile as a fully functional free release and with premium subscriptions. It runs on Linux, Windows, Mac and Android devices. The free version is ad-supported. Today's mobile users are accustomed to ad-supported apps and other software, according to Cole Armstrong, senior director for global marketing at Kingsoft. WPS Cloud is designed to work as a companion to WPS Office, offering users the benefits of cloud computing, such as flexibility and collaboration. Cloud adoption continues to soar, according to a report by Allied Research. The personal cloud market, in particular, is expected to reach US$89.9 billion globally by 2020. Providing cloud support with WPS Office will provide a good alternative to the likes of Microsoft's OneDrive offering and Google's Drive, which is part of its G Suite ecosystem, noted Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "It will allow Kingsoft to position WPS Office as a fully capable alternative to solutions and services from larger competitors," he told LinuxInsider. Kingsoft first launched WPS in China almost 30 years ago. It now boasts more than 1.2 billion installs worldwide. Viable Proprietary Option WPS Cloud is a complete document storage and management service that lets users view and edit files anywhere at anytime. Automatic backup and link-sharing tools promote real-time collaboration across multiple devices and platforms. "The new cloud storage service should enable Kingsoft to compete on a more equal footing with traditional office productivity vendors, and is also likely to be welcomed by the company's target SMB customers," observed King. The cloud service complements the WPS Office's File Roaming feature announced earlier this year, he added, which allows users to download and work with files seamlessly on multiple devices, including smartphones, tablets and traditional PCs. Files are protected from loss with enterprise-level data security and multiple backups. WPS Office offers user options beyond those available in products such as Microsoft Office and Libre Office, according to WPS. For example, users can create, view, edit, store and share documents to improve their productivity. Users can access files either from within WPS Office, or through the WPS Cloud Web portal. The enhanced usability offers Linux users an ideal free office software alternative to Microsoft Office. It also gives users on other platforms another office suite option besides LibreOffice. Feature Set WPS Writer, Presentation, Spreadsheets and PDF Reader/Converter are fully compatible with other office software solutions. Users of both the free and premium versions of WPS Office + Cloud receive 1 GB of free storage space on WPS Cloud. However, the free version limits the number of connected devices to three, said Kingsoft's Armstrong. Users so far can not purchase additional cloud storage space, he told LinuxInsider, "but Kingsoft plans to add that capability later this year." Users must register the product -- both the free and premium versions -- to access the WPS Cloud's 1 GB of free cloud storage. Registration is available through linking existing email, Facebook, Google, Dropbox or Twitter accounts. Both free and premium users also get file roaming and cross device support. File roaming allows users to open or create documents in WPS Office. The documents automatically save to WPS Cloud. Users see a list of recent files that they can access across all connected devices, including Windows PCs, Android or iOS mobile devices, and those running the Linux OS. As with file-sharing on other cloud storage platforms, a document creator can share a direct link that allows intended recipients to view and download WPS documents even if they do not have the WPS Office with Cloud suite, noted Armstrong. A feature that lets users view files through a Web browser currently is available only in the China version, but Kingsoft hopes to add that feature globally soon, Armstrong said. Meeting Users' Needs Cross-platform support is essential. So is cloud security. Kingsoft addresses both concerns in its latest offering. "Users are increasingly adopting and using apps and documents in the cloud and growing accustomed to accessing content across devices regardless of their environment," said Armstrong. "More and more, they want equal access to office software, whether on a mobile device or traditional PC." Files are protected from loss with enterprise-level data security and multiple backups. All data is stored in the user's country of residence. Cost and Product Specs Users can subscribe to the premium version of WPS Office + Cloud for US$3.99 per month or $29.99 per year. A one-time $79.99 payment provides a lifetime subscription. The WPS Office suite supports DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PDF, TXT, HTM, RTF, DOT and DOTX file formats. The 1 GB cloud storage limit is paltry compared to the space provided by competing cloud products associated with office suite platforms, but the product cost for WPS Office is considerably lower. For instance, Microsoft Office provides 1 TB of cloud storage on OneDrive for $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year. Google's G Suite provides 30 GB on Google Drive for $5 per month. Premium upgrades come with additional features and tools. However, the free versions -- dubbed "sponsored access" because they display ads -- are fully functional and not otherwise limited in performance. The premium features include a PDF to Word Converter and a PDF Split and Merge tool. Additional fonts and templates also are included. No ads are displayed in the premium versions. Leading-Edge Product It's worth mentioning that rather than using the new service, Kingsoft customers can utilize Microsoft or Google cloud storage for their WPS Office documents instead, noted Pund-IT's King. "In fact, many if not most of them likely already use OneDrive or Google Drive services.," he said, "so it will be critical for Kingsoft to proactively reach out to its SMB clients and provide services designed to their core needs." The company already has begun doing just that. However, "I expect that drumbeat to intensify," said King, "after the WPS Cloud announcement is official." Jack M.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 134 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares270 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company. I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

MrDrWho13 Is this the guy you hired after that ad? Was this the article which got him the place? I quite like this writing style. VAVAMk_2 We wouldn't be giving him the warm welcome to AP if we weren't hard on him ;) dcdttu "...couldn't care less" abc Any writer whose first post on this site is criticism of Google (especially the Pixel), gets my support! A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! Indian Yes we guessed him to be the new man by reading his name, Trevor "Newman" Marcie Mtz Good article...But it's "couldn't care less". chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine CF542 6 months? I replaced my S7E three times in four months for chronic and various problems before giving up and going Pixel blueman24 "Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES." "I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge" "Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months." You brought a $700 S7edge and not a $300 oneplus, so it should not be acceptable for it to become less responsive after 6 months? Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. WARLORD VIII On the up side the Pixel isn't catching on fire 😎 das I thought that was a feature for survivalists. :P Eric Works for me. The most stable software wise of any phone I've ever used. Paid 300 for mine and prefer it over the s7. Curved screens don't like screen protector. Nothing like water resistant on a phone that looks like a cat danced on it. Another huge plus is the lack of carrier spam. I'm not getting all the complaints. Google showed us we'd be getting if we choose to buy it. I for one have no regrets about doing so. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. Kristian Ivanov I'm not going to comment on the actual design, I want to hear thoughts comparing it to the undesputed legend - Nexus 5 (design only) JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. CF542 The only thing that the S7/S8 truly suffer from is having Samsung as a parent. They turned the phone (s) into a piece of bloatware full of crappy software that nobody wants. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Ryan Those are usability preferences. I will agree the settings are a freaking nightmare to find, but I dont go into settings often. Right now, and for over a year now, bluetooth audio has been straight-up broken. They implemented that absoloute volume BS without coding how to handle devices that dont send volume information, breaking it in my car. Then the idiots put developer setting that is to allow you to disable it but they didnt even test it and the user doesnt have permissions to change that setting, so the switch does nothing. That is a BIG bug, and one that Google has refused to address for over a year. Then there is the fact that my phone, and the first Nexus phone I have had to deal with this on, has to be rebooted every few weeks because it slows down horribly. Jack Smith Based on what? Had every iPhone since the 3G and relatively recently added Android as carry both and Android is excellent. So much is written is just simply not true. Suggest actually give recent Android a try and you might be surprised ;). Ryan Ive had android for coming up on 8 years, HTC Hero was the first, then one more HTC before going Nexus. Been on Nexus and still am with my 5x. I know, personally, some of the MAJOR shortcomings of Googles implementation of Android. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. ScratchC The problem with the Internet is how do I know you actually own one? Or are you just a troll. In any case, I unfortunately had to pass on the Pixel my S6 shit the bed and I had just upgraded to the S7. My gf tho.. I somehow convinced her to grab a Pixel on Verizon. She has not had not 1 issue. I'm not saying they don't exist. It's just not as bad as commenters trying to win an argument make it seem. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of the 22 Pixel photos had halos. None of the LG G6 photos had halos. whispy_snippet Wow. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. Vega007 My Pixel is, by far, the best phone I have ever had for battery life. Christopher Bement I'm only going with devices I've actually used, I haven't touched a Pixel personally. All I can say is it's day and night between the N6 and S7 on a given work day where I'm calling, texting and emailing almost constantly. Vega007 That's a good point, it all depends on what phone we have used to compare it to. I have never used a S7 Edge, but I have used a S7. While the battery life was fine, the Pixel does do better for my usage (I'm using the 5" btw). And that's the real key to battery issue is personal use. We all use our devices differently so battery life will always be subjective. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. ScratchC The iPhone has been in trouble for some time. It's why it started playing catch up (Forget current sales up to now. Poll after poll, iPhone users are bored of iPhones) Actually Google's Android is in trouble as well. Samsung is doing their own thing. Google needs to put it's foot down or compete. The Pixel is an attempt to do so. It's not perfect by any means. it's better than nothing and it was a solid first entry. If you simply don't like it.. Buy elsewhere. that's the beauty of Android. I think you guys forget, that out of our fanboy bubble, most people when they think of Android have a distinct definition. I'm talking the average consumer...they think Android = cheap phone from prepaid carrier that's slow, plastic, horrible camera & full of bugs. Or.. Android = Samsung Galaxy. Your average consumer still doesn't know what a Pixel is nvm that they don't even know what a Nexus was. Android phones need to be a premium product to compete. They need to charge the amount of money it takes for proper R&D.. Customer support etc. Google cannot sell at a loss and accomplish this. This very reason is why Samsung holds the Android crown. Regardless of your opinion towards their devices. Remember that Carrier subsidizing is how Galaxy devices sell by the millions. Iphones as well. Google is on the right path. They just need to bring the next Pixel to all carriers. Lindsay Meyer You're right. I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved those iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices), and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick (and their new iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to throw my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability, and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. mrjayviper Fairly new? How long have they been selling Nexus phones and other devices? MJ Let me get this straight... You left a comment without reading the whole discussion? I already very clearly laid out an actual argument but thanks for your input. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. madcanada That's correct, I'm pissed that Pixel gets a better camera software while Nexus is fundamentally the same in the department. I understand your point about camera being a combination of both hardware and software, but unlike, say, Apple, where each iteration is actually better in terms of hardware, and older iPhones still get whatever features they can physically run, Google decided to accentuate the difference by simply denying their last year phone the same updates. Where Apple only denies updates when the old phone can't actually handle them Google is simply abandoning their last year model to justify the price of the Pixel. whispy_snippet Except there's one key difference. Unlike iPhones that release each year, the Nexus 6P is not of the Pixel lineage. The Pixel is the first of its kind. madcanada That makes not a shred of difference in the argument I'm making. I find denying last year phone updates it perfectly capable of running, so you can justify the price of the new phone ethically questionable. I don't care if they rebranded, their decision to not give Nexus the updates it can handle is only guided by the fact that they wanted to charge twice the price for Pixel, and they couldn't have if Nexus got the goodies. whispy_snippet Ethically questionable? No, mate, it's business. Google's ultimate responsibility is maximising profits for shareholders. You're cranky that your 6P can't do what the more expensive a Pixel can do. Now imagine how Pixel owners would feel if they saw cheaper, older phones from the same company doing exactly the same thing as theirs. Again, I sympathise to an extent, but ultimately you get what you pay for. If you want the Pixel experience, buy it. madcanada I'm not cranky because my Nexus 6P can't do things Pixel can, on the contrary, I get full Pixel experience with free unlimited full size photo upload, Pixel launcher, Pixel camera, and day one Google Assistant on Nexus 6P. I'm cranky because I need to go to XDA to get them goodies. I understand it's business, but if you want to sell charge twice for the phone - sell a better phone, give us a better camera, bigger battery life, and don't downgrade our goddamn speakers. whispy_snippet Mate, you're simply not making sense anymore. You're effectively wanting something for nothing. You want Google to give you a Pixel quality camera experience on an older, less expensive phone from an entirely different lineage - for free. You're not entitled to free stuff. I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree. madcanada you can disagree all your want, i outlined my gripe with Google in the first post, then you decided to argue about the camera. New lineage or not, when you market Nexus as the phone that gets all the Google love, and then you just leave users behind right next generation simply to justify the price hike of new Pixel - that's low. Apple's feature fragmentation is driven solely by the hardware - newer phones get new exclusive features because older models can't do the same thing physically. Google is creating artificial fragmentation in order to justify twice the price. That's not the Google I remember and that's not the direction I like. Obviously it's their choice. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? Mix Sounds like you have not done this before because sending your phone to Google first, waiting for them to get it and look it over THEN sending a replacement is, 100%, the bad choice. Having them send you the phone first and put a hold on your creditcard is the better and faster choice! Complaining gets you nothing, USA got free daydream headsets, Canadians got nothing. The phone, after taxes, was $1,320.48 - close enough for me to complain about it at the $1,400 point, lol. John Doe OMG, YOU CAN'T READ? That is what I said Google does but you said you had to wait 7 days for your phone but they send you the phone first then you send yours in so no waiting. Yes I have done this before. With Apple, Google, and other companies...it is standard practice. No, they don't charge you taxes they just put a hold of the price of the phone not your total purchase price. Maybe it is just different in Canada...you should stop buying Google products there *rolls eyes* Lindsay Meyer If your damaged, soon-to-be-returned Pixel phone is broken and unusable, there would indeed be a waiting period to have a working phone in either case, because, being unable to easily switch your device at a physical brick and mortar store, you would be at the mercy of waiting for for Google's mailed replacement to have a working phone again. John Doe Google sens it next day here in the US Mix You straight up told me that I chose the bad option: "Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault." when I did not choose the bad option. If my phone bricked, which it did, and it takes 7 days for Googles phone to get to me I have no phone for 7 days, that is waiting without a phone! I think we are both right, 12 of this and a dozen of that, lol. <3 Stuff in Canada is more expensive and shipping generally sucks. I normally chose 2 day shipping with Amazon and get refunded shipping costs because the shipping companies miss the delivery date constantly. Nexus 4 and 5 have been sweet, my Pixel experience has been garbage. Their customer service has been good though so yay for that. Lindsay Meyer Canadian $ ≠ US $ John Doe Yeah but the phone still does not cost $1,400 in canada so yeah destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I'd far rather spend 5-10 minutes online from home getting my replacement shipped to me for free than having to go into a store, talk to someone who's less knowledgeable about my phone than I am, convince them to get it replaced, and then pay them an additional $35 to have them facilitate my phone then getting shipped to their store where I have to return to pick it up. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. Aaron Yeah, top notch. Tell that to all those iPhone 6plus users with the death screen disease and Apple does nothing... mrjayviper Out of warranty? I don't think Google supports out of warranty devices to donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. Berni Hargrove Hold on now, Chromebooks are more than good enough if you go price for price on a cheap laptop. There's no way that $200 Windows laptop with 2gigs of ram is performing on the same level as a $200 Chromebook with the same specs. In addition the reason why "Good Enough" applies to this is because the average person wants to pay very little for a computer, but have it be "fast and last a long time" to effectively browse and use Office. Anyone here should know, unless you are getting over on someone, the least you should pay for decent laptop is $500, but the amount of times I've had people in Best Buy whine that that's too expensive for them to just be using Office and small tasks is frequent. Google can make good products that are ready for primetime when they don't have their ass or in the clouds, but sadly as their messaging strategy has showed us, that's increasingly uncommon. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Eric Marciniak Doesn't help that Best Buy has a giant iPhone 7 ad that literally blocks the pixel display from view right when you walk in haha. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8283702e9d03a34df4cfb2bd525ea593d0304d3937690392b7b3acc57eb7620e.jpg Berni Hargrove Best Buy is terrible with product placement. Shit literally changes every season if not more. Good luck finding anything remotely niche on your own. lol Jon E. Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. Berni Hargrove While I agree with a lot of what you said, some of your logic is flawed. Take america for example. There's over 150 million people here. It would take at least 15 million in sales here alone, just to see 1 in 10 people with it. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers. C Lo Good first article Trevor. Welcome aboard. Suyash Bansal I liked the article. 🙃 Orjuan Google Pixels customer service is great if you ask me. It takes like a week to get a replacement, not a month. Also, comparing it to the One Plus 3T is unfair, you didn't mention the superior processing and graphical power and the fact that it gets updates for the next 5-8 years. It also features Google Assistant, which is a big selling point. Add all those up and pixel is worth the extra 400. Plus, I got a regular pixel, with a two year protection plan, 128 GB, and it's still cheaper than iPhone. Google Pixel is a commercial and consumer success. Do your research before spouting out shit, all you did was look at the obvious facts and ignored the small stuff that counts. "UGHHHHH, it has a better camera and that's it.". RESEARCH YOUR TOPICS, Google Pixel is $400 more than One Plus 3T because it's better! Orjuan Plus, Nexus was barely Google at all, they just supplied the best version of Android while hiring an OEM to make the parts and design, while slapping their logo on it. Nexus was good, but not Google's essence, it was a startup for Pixel, which is 100% Google. AJZ16 couldn't care less* usamaisawake I had an entire column of pixels that were not working properly. Thing is my Pixel arrived in the first shipment and I had to leave the country so I didn't umbox it until 4 weeks later. When I called to let them know, they were curious why I waited so long and I explained I hadn't turned it on till just then. They didn't give me any trouble with it and exchanged it right away. They sent the new phone and then after I received it I shipped the old back to them. Perhaps this was still early in the release of the phone so they felt more obligated to make sure the experience was good. Phil Rowley My pixel bricked. I thought Google's customer service (along with bestbuy even though I paid for their stupid geek squad) were horrible. I hate to say it but Verizon was the most helpful and luckily I pay for their monthly insurance. Colin Richardson I miss the Nexus line.. Thankfully I can still buy some Nexus 5X phones (not refurbished). But that will not last. I have no idea what I will do for a phone after that.. I want a Stock Android phone, not a Stock Android Flagship phone. Max Johnson There are plenty of stock-like flagship and non-flagship Android phones. HTC, Sony, Moto and OnePlus are all stock based at varying prices. If you want direct update from Google and good customer service that's a different story, I think that's the main thing now, to get the same quality of support as Apple on Android. I'm surprised to get frequently updates from Sony with latest monthly security patches on my X Compact. Micah T "couldn't* care less." Think about it.... Tr3ple I bought a Pixel XL for 370 and I threw my Galaxy S7 edge in the drawer LMAO 😂 oh Happy day. Sammy Phillips 370 USD? or 370 Euro? Tr3ple USD, bought it 220 with a broken screen and fixed it for 150. So I spent 370. mtz Interesting article however, in the same way Microsoft is not really trying to sell the overpriced Surface Studio , Google is not trying to sell Pixels. Why? Simple. Goole has OEM partners that have supported the Android platform by providing the hardware from the beginning. While it one thing for Google to partner with a carrier each year and release a basic Nexus phone its an entirely different thing for them to release top tier Device and undercut thoes partners on price. Tony Bundy Replied via non-existent really blue Pixel. Yes, wasn't easy but here I am. 😀 Pixel.ization.alism Well precisely Google Blue would be #4285F4 not #4485ED if you would ask. Zuxs13 This was a rather poor opinion piece. You make claims like you can't "easily get a replacement pixel" which is completely untrue. The Apple store is hardly the only place that sells phones and offers good customer service. The OP3T might be readily available, but most consumers have no clue what it is or where to even buy one and would rather buy a phone that is sold at their service provider or local best buy and is supported by 24/hr support service. das "Couldn't care less" - if one *could* care less, than it currently cares. Lindsay Meyer I mentioned this in another thread but feel it probably merits its own post here, coming from the perspective of a disenchanted iPhone user who now owns a Pixel (and is still disenchanted). I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved the iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices) and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick, or worse, new packaging on the same lipstick (and their upgraded iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to hurl my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's kind of a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have more innovative features, but Apple with come right behind it and perfect those features. That's what they do now. Still glad I didn't get the iPhone 7; Apple didn't deserve my business, but Pixel has been a disappointment to me thus far. For the price, I'd prefer my husband's Nexus 6. I think he'd prefer his old HTC if it had front-facing speakers lol. I just don't feel there's a lot of good options out there right now that justify the cost. I have given serious thought to trying to find a replacement comparable to the old Sanyo 6100 (yes, that one) and then throwing an iPad or a tablet in my purse. Maybe even that old B&O phone would be fun. I'm just tired of my need for a smartphone to be continually exploited by these inferior products; half the time they break right after the warranty expires, and like an endentured servant, I'm forced into the process all over again. Also, the fact that this Pixel wants to track everything I do scares the bejeezus out of me. I'm sure Apple has done the same thing more covertly for years, but seeing everything I say, type, search, view, read.. not to mention every place I eat at, travel to or shop.. neatly organized into a little packaged profile makes me feel like a product more than ever. Eliminating Google's permissions to track this info also eliminates much of the Pixel's functionality as a smart phone with fluid communication between apps. I should have probably mentioned this first because I absolutely hate that aspect of it. Renee Looker I don't know about anyone else's opinion on the Pixel phone but I have the Pixel XL Blue and have had it since release. I've not had any issues with my phone, absolutely love it. Really quite eager to see what Google will be releasing next, the rumors are on the rise on what's up next. Nicholas Conrad Great article! techieland You and we are the customers when it come to the Pixel and Pixel Xl. And even the late and great Nexus products to some extent. Personally I think the Pixel phones were a fail, Google should have stuck to making reference level phones to ensure the manufacturers understand what the minimum an Android phone is supposed to be like. Samsung and OnePlus obviously gets it but it seems LG, HTC, & Motorola, are struggling despite all 3 being manufacturers of Nexus/AOSP devices. sgtguthrie *couldn't care less Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 142k 105k Latest Deals 2 [Deal Alert] Order an Amazon gift card valued at $25 or more through Alexa and get a $5 promo credit 2017/04/11 3:50pm PDTApr 11, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Verizon BlackBerry Priv for $259.99 on eBay 2017/04/11 12:35pm PDTApr 11, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Amazon's Gold Box deal has a SanDisk MicroSD 256GB for $120 and a 128GB dual USB-C/A drive for $39 2017/04/11 4:46am PDTApr 11, 2017 35 [Update: Added some more] Deal Alert: Here are some more temporarily free apps and games for your Sunday 2017/04/09 3:05pm PDTApr 9, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Gen LTE for $179.99 ($220 off) on eBay 2017/04/08 7:15pm PDTApr 8, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

A touch of a finger unlocks the phone — no password required. With services like Apple Pay or Android Pay, a fingerprint can buy a bag of groceries, a new laptop or even a $1 million vintage Aston Martin. And pressing a finger inside a banking app allows the user to pay bills or transfer thousands of dollars. While such wizardry is convenient, it has also left a gaping security hole. New findings published Monday by researchers at New York University and Michigan State University suggest that smartphones can easily be fooled by fake fingerprints digitally composed of many common features found in human prints. In computer simulations, the researchers from the universities were able to develop a set of artificial “MasterPrints” that could match real prints similar to those used by phones as much as 65 percent of the time. The researchers did not test their approach with real phones, and other security experts said the match rate would be significantly lower in real-life conditions. Still, the findings raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of fingerprint security on smartphones. “It’s almost certainly not as worrisome as presented, but it’s almost certainly pretty darn bad,” said Andy Adler, a professor of systems and computer engineering at Carleton University in Canada, who studies biometric security systems. “If all I want to do is take your phone and use your Apple Pay to buy stuff, if I can get into 1 in 10 phones, that’s not bad odds.” Full human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but the finger scanners on phones are so small that they read only partial fingerprints. When a user sets up fingerprint security on an Apple iPhone or a phone that runs Google’s Android software, the phone typically takes eight to 10 images of a finger to make it easier to make a match. And many users record more than one finger — say, the thumb and forefinger of each hand. Sample fingerprints that the researchers at N.Y.U. and Michigan State University compared against the so-called MasterPrints. Solid black lines around a print indicate a match. Since a finger swipe has to match only one stored image to unlock the phone, the system is vulnerable to false matches. “It’s as if you have 30 passwords and the attacker only has to match one,” said Nasir Memon, a professor of computer science and engineering at N.Y.U.’s Tandon School of Engineering, who is one of three authors of the study, which was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security. The other authors are Aditi Roy, a postdoctoral fellow at N.Y.U.’s Tandon School, and Arun Ross, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State. Dr. Memon said their findings indicated that if you could somehow create a magic glove with a MasterPrint on each finger, you could get into 40 to 50 percent of iPhones within the five tries allowed before the phone demands the numeric password, known as a personal identification number. Apple said the chance of a false match in the iPhone’s fingerprint system was 1 in 50,000 with one fingerprint enrolled. Ryan James, a company spokesman, said Apple had tested various attacks when developing its Touch ID system, and also incorporated other security features to prevent false matches. Google declined to comment. The actual risk is difficult to quantify. Apple and Google keep many details of their fingerprint technology secret, and the dozens of companies that make Android phones can adapt Google’s standard design in ways that reduce the level of security. Stephanie Schuckers, a professor at Clarkson University and director of the Center for Identification Technology Research, was cautious about the implications of the MasterPrint findings. She said the researchers used a midrange, commercially available software program that was designed to match full fingerprints, limiting the broader applicability of their findings. “To really know what the impact would be on a cellphone, you’d have to try it on the cellphone,” she said. She noted that cellphone makers and others who use fingerprint security systems are studying anti-spoofing techniques to detect the presence of a real finger, such as looking for perspiration or examining patterns in deeper layers of skin. A new fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm, for example, uses ultrasound. Aditi Roy, the lead author of a new paper on master fingerprints that could be used to unlock smartphones, examines data on her computer at N.Y.U.’s Tandon School of Engineering.CreditRoger Kisby for The New York Times Phone makers also said that the ease of touching a finger to unlock a phone meant more users actually turned on security features instead of leaving their phones unlocked — a common habit in the early days of smartphones. Dr. Ross acknowledged the limitations of the work. “Most of the current smartphone vendors do not give us access to the fingerprint image,” he said. Still, the team’s fundamental finding that partial fingerprints are vulnerable to spoofing is significant, said Chris Boehnen, the manager of the federal government’s Odin program, which studies how to defeat biometric security attacks as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. “What’s concerning here is that you could find a random phone, and your barrier to attack is pretty low,” Dr. Boehnen said. Phone makers could easily increase security by making it harder to match the partial fingerprint, he said, “but the average phone company is more worried about you being annoyed that you have to put your finger against the phone two or three times than they are with someone breaking into it.” Adding a larger fingerprint sensor would also decrease the risk, Dr. Boehnen said. And some newer biometric security options, such as the iris scanner in Samsung’s new Galaxy S8, are harder to fool. Dr. Memon said that despite his research he was still using fingerprint security on his iPhone. “I’m not worried,” he said. “I think it’s still a very convenient way of unlocking a phone. But I’d rather see Apple make me enter the PIN if it’s idle for one hour.” Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter @vindugoel.

Business Apps | 11 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (1) BusyCal 2/Google Calendar Users Should Upgrade by Adam C. Engst We’re fans of BusyCal, the replacement for Apple’s Calendar app from BusyMac. The company has announced that on 20 April 2017, Google will no longer allow apps to sign in to Google Calendar using “web-views,” basically embedded mini-browsers. Instead, all apps will have to send sign-in requests out to a full Web browser. This change doesn’t affect the current BusyCal 3, but it will prevent the older BusyCal 2 from connecting to Google Calendar entirely. There are three possibilities for those who are still using BusyCal 2: If you sync with Google Calendar and want to keep using BusyCal, you have to upgrade to BusyCal 3. If you sync with Google Calendar, but either don’t want to pay for the upgrade or are using OS X 10.10 Yosemite or earlier, falling back to Apple’s Calendar app is likely the easiest course of action. If you don’t sync with Google Calendar at all, you don’t have to do anything — BusyCal 2 will continue to work fine. The upgrade to BusyCal 3 costs $29.99 for existing customers, or, if you purchased BusyCal 2 after 1 March 2016, the upgrade is free. BusyMac provides full instructions on how to get the upgrade pricing and perform the upgrade. BusyCal 3 requires 10.11 El Capitan or later. BusyCal 3 improves on BusyCal 2 in numerous ways, including: Alerts that are sensitive to travel time and traffic conditions A redesigned menu bar app that provides a mini-month calendar Inline display of timed to-dos with other calendar events Quick entry of events and to-dos using natural language   TextExpander: Communicate smarter. Accuracy and consistency wherever you type. Insert “snippets” of text from a repository of boilerplate, emails and other text. Seamless sharing between you and your team on Mac, Windows, and iOS <http://smle.us/newte-tb>   Comments about BusyCal 2/Google Calendar Users Should Upgrade To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed). Your comment will appear after you follow a link in the one-time confirmation message we send to verify that you're a real person. A change in Google Calendar will make it incompatible with BusyCal 2 as of 20 April 2017. The solution is to upgrade to BusyCal 3, if possible. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Derek Roff   2017-04-11 22:32 I bought BusyCal on the recommendation of TidBITS, and upgraded to BusyCal 2, again following your recommendation. It was a competent program for me, but I never got that excited about it. I had some trouble with the way it handles time zones when I travel, and had a bad customer service/tech support experience in trying to solve those problems. When BusyCal told me that I needed to pay for yet another upgrade, I started to reconsider my calendar options. I've also had Fantastical 1, which I bought after a TidBITS review. It was a bit quirky, but I like the menu bar widget and the natural language input options, so I used it to input many of my calendar events, while using BusyCal to view the calendar. Facing the BusyCal upgrade decision, I contacted Fantastical, and discussed some of the things I wanted from a calendar, asking whether Fantastical 2 addressed my concerns. I got a detailed and useful response. They also told me about their current 20% off sale. I decided to upgrade to Fantastical 2.3.x. I've been very happy with the change. Fantastical does a number of things in ways that I like. Their training videos are short, focused, and informative. Technical support has been very good, quick to respond, and helpful. I have no connection with the company, except as a satisfied customer, who would like to see them succeed. If you are unsure about upgrading to BusyCal, take a look at Fantastical, and see if it appeals to you. Reply  Search   Cached. Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2017 Adam C.

Nope, Nothing to See Here Google: Gender Pay Gap? Nope, Nothing to See Here By Angela Moscaritolo April 11, 2017 11:32am EST 10 Comments Google pushes back on a Department of Labor report, and says it 'conducts rigorous, annual analyses' to make sure it adheres to equal pay practices. Google is pushing back against claims from the US Department of Labor that it systemically discriminates against female employees by paying them less than their male counterparts. In a Tuesday blog post, Google's Vice President of people operations, Eileen Naughton, said the company "conducts rigorous, annual analyses so that our pay practices remain aligned with our commitment to equal pay practices. "So we were quite surprised when a representative of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs at the US Department of Labor (OFCCP) accused us of not compensating women fairly," she added. "We were taken aback by this assertion, which came without any supporting data or methodology." Naughton went on to say that the Labor Department reached its conclusion "even as the [agency] is seeking thousands of employee records, including contact details of our employees." Google's response comes after Labor Department officials late last week said they had uncovered evidence of widespread gender-based discrimination at the firm, according to The Guardian. "We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," DoL Regional Director Janette Wipper said in a San Francisco federal court on Friday, according to the report. Wipper was testifying at a hearing over a lawsuit the agency filed against Google in January seeking to force it to hand over salary information to the government. The Guardian also got in touch with DoL Regional Solicitor Janet Herold, who acknowledged that the investigation is not yet complete, but said the department "has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters. "The government's analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry," Herold added. Related Gender Pay Gap: Real, But Improving Gender Pay Gap: Real, But Improving Google today pushed back against those claims, saying it goes to great lengths to ensure equal pay for men and women. "Our pay equity model … looks at employees in the same job categories, and analyzes their compensation to confirm that the adjusted amount shows no statistically significant differences between men's and women's compensation," Naughton wrote. If the company discovers that women are being paid a "significantly lower amount," it makes adjustments to bring their compensation in line with others. "In late 2016, we performed our most recent analysis across 52 different, major job categories, and found no gender pay gap," Naughton wrote.

Despite the growing popularity of Chromebooks in schools in the United States, schools here are still off the pace in adopting these low-cost laptops. But Google believes there is now enough consumer demand for Chromebooks.ST PHOTO: FELINE LIM Published10 hours ago More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Purchase Article Permalink: http://str.sg/4XhH Copy Signs point to computers running on Google ChromeOS making a comeback Vincent Chang vinchang@sph.com.sg Chromebooks could be seen everywhere in the classrooms of Yusof Ishak Secondary School for three days at the end of last month. Designated "Chromebook Day", Secondary 1 to 3 students used laptops that run on the ChromeOS operating system for lessons. E-Learning Day followed and students could opt to stay at home to complete assignments using their Chromebooks. According to a school spokesman, students "enjoyed e-learning as it encouraged them to be self-directed learners". Yusof Ishak Secondary is among a handful of local schools that use Chromebooks in classrooms. Another one is Punggol Secondary School. About 35 per cent of its students use Chromebooks as part of the school's one-to-one computing initiative to enhance learning through collaboration and self-directed activities. The others use Windows or Apple computers. "Students use their Chromebooks or learning devices to submit their responses on-site through Web apps like Linoit or Padlet, while teachers and peers can provide feedback to students instantaneously," said Mr Kelvin Lee, who teaches biology and geography at the school. CHROMEBOOK FAQs 1 WHAT ARE CHROMEBOOKS? They are laptops that run the lightweight ChromeOS operating system with the Chrome browser interface. They have limited internal storage (up to 64GB). Instead, cloud storage (for instance, 100GB Google Drive for two years) is usually bundled. Security and feature updates are also automatically pushed to Chromebooks 2 WHAT SOFTWARE CAN I RUN ON CHROMEBOOKS? Chromebooks are built to run Web-based apps that operate inside its Chrome browser. Newer models have support for the same Android apps that run on Android phones and tablets, via the Google Play Store., though This feature is still in beta testing, though. 3 CAN I USE THEM WITHOUT AN INTERNET CONNECTION? Early Chromebooks needed to be connected to a Wi-Fi network all the time, and were severely handicapped without a connection. But Google and other developers have since added offline functionality for some apps, including Gmail and Google Docs. 4 HOW MUCH DO THEY COST? They typically cost from $300 to $500, though some PC makers have also launched higher-end models that are over $1,000. 5 WHERE CAN I BUY THEM? They are available directly from PC makers via their websites. Both schools are the exception rather than the norm. Despite the growing popularity of Chromebooks in schools in the United States, schools here are slow to adopt the low-cost laptops. In the US, Chromebooks even outsold Apple computers in Q1 2016, thanks to the US education market, according to market-research firm IDC. More than 10 million Chromebooks were sold worldwide last year, 40 per cent more than in 2015. Outside of the US, Chromebooks have had mixed success in education. A Futuresource report said Sweden was the only country where Chromebooks were the top-selling device in schools last year. "In the Asia-Pacific, we have seen success stories only in Australia and New Zealand. Chrome shipments for education remain very small in Singapore," said IDC research manager Maciek Gornicki. The Ministry of Education (MOE) does not track Chromebook usage in local schools. "Schools are given the autonomy and discretion to experiment with new devices, as long as these are appropriate for learning needs," said an MOE spokesman. Singapore is "a very Windows (heavy) country", said Google's vice-president of product management, Mr Caesar Sengupta, because "we adopted computing before many other countries, so a lot of our schools and government agencies use Windows devices". However, the Government's move to delink Internet access from computers used officially by public servants has resulted in plans to buy low-cost Web-surfing devices, including Chromebooks. Google said that more than 1,000 Chromebooks are now in use at more than 10 government agencies. "We are starting to see good traction in schools, even though we haven't expressly pushed Chromebooks here," Mr Sengupta said. Chromebooks were initially sold at retail outlets here in 2013. But they were poorly received and subsequently available only if you contact the manufacturer directly. But there are signs of a comeback. Newstead Technologies started selling Chromebooks last year at the HP Store at Marina Square, while reseller GSA plans to launch a Web portal at the end of the month to sell them to the public. "The big thing we're trying to tell the manufacturers is that there is enough consumer demand now to bring them back into the consumer space," said Mr Sengupta. A new feature to run Android apps on Chromebooks may boost consumer adoption. All new Chromebooks launched this year will support the Google Play Store - older models will gradually get this feature, too. This move tackles the oft-repeated criticism that there are limited apps for Chromebooks. New convertible Chromebooks with touchscreens have already been launched. The next version of Android will also have better keyboard support for Android apps. Mr Gornicki was more cautious: "Introducing Google Play to Chromebooks will definitely make them more interesting to consumers. However, it is too early to say that it will be a game changer."

Business Apps | 11 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (0) Comparing Five Travel Management Apps by Mike Matthews Well over 30 years ago, I had just started a new job when the boss strolled by — and out of the clear, blue, friendly skies asked me to make an airline reservation for him. I had little to go on, just the destination airport, travel days, and some rough travel times. I had no idea about his airline preferences, much less whether he preferred window or aisle seating. Back in those days, you called a travel agent and stepped through the process of getting a ticket delivered to your door. Or, if you wanted to make sure the travel agent was on target, you could do a little of the legwork yourself first by looking up flights in the Official Airline Guide, a thick book with tiny phonebook type. I eventually located a suitable set of flights and passed the info on to his assistant, who dutifully typed the itinerary on an index card for him to carry in his pocket. How times have changed! Airlines now offer booking Web sites, their own apps, and mobile boarding passes. Plus, you can quickly and easily research flights, hotels, rental cars, and more with apps that are dedicated to that purpose. But two things haven’t changed: travel is still a very personal thing, and I’m still looking for the best way to keep all my travel info in one place. The index card approach just doesn’t cut it today. Over the years, I’ve done a fair bit of traveling, both business and personal, and here’s what I’m looking for in a travel management app: Easy itinerary creation, with as little manual data entry as possible and the option to manage it on different devices The capability to share an itinerary with other people Automatic updates Syncing of data Notifications, in as many ways as possible Thoroughness, with all the bases covered, and bonus points for additional features directly related to the itinerary A streamlined interface that lets me get info quickly, ideally with one hand while on the move through an airport There are a number of candidates in the App Store, but these five stood out: App in the Air, Google Trips, Kayak, TripCase, and TripIt. All the apps have most of the same basic features. After you set up an account with their service, they scan your email inbox for details about a trip (flight times, hotel bookings, etc.) and build an itinerary for you. With most of the apps, you can also either forward booking emails you’ve received to a standard address to create the itinerary or enter the details manually. Once the trip is in place, the app generates additional information such as airport info and local weather, and adds it to your itinerary. You can share the trip with others, add the details to your calendar, and receive notifications about trip-related activities such as check-in times and flight delays. If you’re on the move, your travel plans should move with you in the most convenient way possible. So all these apps make their data accessible on different devices, and most of them extend a subset of their features to the Apple Watch. Only Google Trips lacks an Apple Watch app, and of the other four, only TripIt doesn’t include a complication that can show at-a-glance flight details such as gate information, time to check-in, and baggage claim carousels. Also, all but Google Trips include a Messages app, which can be helpful if you regularly need to share trip details in conversations. Beyond these basics, there’s plenty of room for each app to differentiate itself, be it through the use of crowdsourcing, packing lists, flight trackers, or the ability to book travel from within the app. In short, there’s probably an app in this group with features that will best fit your needs. We can’t cover every nuance in this article, but let’s take a look at some of the more interesting features. Google Trips -- Google is nearly ubiquitous and its services are generally regarded as being top tier. Plenty of people rely on Google while planning and booking travel plans, so organizing travel information with the free Google Trips app seems like a reasonable extension of its services. Setup is simple. You allow the app to access your location while using it, allow notifications about your trip to be sent to you, and sign in with your Google account, giving the app permission to detect past and future trips from information it can find in your Gmail account. From there, the app’s real strength appears, as it suggests things to do, creates customizable daily itineraries of places to go, provides food and drink recommendations, covers how to get around in the local area, and offers “need to know” facts such as emergency numbers, shopping, and tipping info. Plus, it lets you download all this information from Google for offline viewing. Making use of Google’s vast collection of the world’s knowledge is easily the strongest part of the app. However, Google Trips is the newest of the five apps in the group and lacks many features that the other apps have. If you don’t use Gmail as your primary email provider, Google Trips won’t be nearly as useful. You can add a trip manually, but unlike the other services, Google doesn’t offer a standard email address to which your booking emails can be forwarded to create an itinerary. Many of the other four apps offer at least some notification options. Google Trips itself contains no notification settings within the app, just the opportunity during setup to enable them — but offers no specifics as to what the notifications are. Also, in the current version of the app, you can’t share itineraries, which may be a deal-breaker for many people. There’s also just an iPhone app; no iPad, Apple Watch, or Messages app. And now a confession: I don’t use Google’s services much. As such, Google Trips has limited value for me because it relies heavily on harvesting flight data from a Google account. As the new app on the block, it’s also devoid of basic features that the other more mature apps have. But if you’re waist-deep in the Google ecosystem, the way the app makes it easy to explore your destination might make it the ideal solution for you or as a companion to one of the other apps. App in the Air -- Not surprisingly, given its name, the free App in the Air focuses on managing air travel but has recently begun to branch out by allowing you to include hotel and car rental details in your itinerary. Flights are organized into cards. Tapping a card reveals all the details from a generous selection of up to 16 customizable widgets, including a timeline, airport and airline info, an online check-in form, maps, wait times, hotel and car rental details, and more. Unique among the five apps, App in the Air presents flight information in a timeline of four segments: Check-in, Boarding, Take-off, and Landing. Knowing these four items in a flight’s timeline can help you prepare for your flight and keep family and business associates in the loop as to your schedule. You can also allow App in the Air to access your calendar to import existing flights and access your contacts for itinerary notifications. App in the Air offers plenty of push and text alerts that you can activate individually (including one for in-flight exercises), but you’ll need a subscription to make them work. Other premium features ($29.99 per year with a free 14-day trial or $49.99 for lifetime access) include a family subscription and unlimited auto check-in. As with many freemium apps, it sports a long list of in-app purchases that range from disabling ads for $0.99 to a lifetime subscription for flight alerts for $49.99. Other notable features include: You can subscribe family and friends to flight alerts too, keeping them in the loop should your itinerary change. Some of the widgets are innovative. One allows you to track your luggage on American Airlines flights. The TSA Rules widget lets you enter an item and responds with rules about whether the item may be carried on board or must be stowed in checked bags. And sometimes widgets appear only if they are relevant; for example, the Uber widget shows up only if there’s service where you are. If you enter your passport information, App in the Air can theoretically check you in for flights automatically. I couldn’t get this feature to work, perhaps because I didn’t have an active subscription, but it would come in handy for airlines like Southwest that don’t assign seats in advance. You can export trips to any of your calendars, which can save you the extra step of downloading flight itineraries from an airline’s Web site and adding them to your calendar. You can import itineraries from TripIt. So if, for example, you want to switch from using TripIt or your company has standardized on TripIt, but you prefer the App in the Air interface or features, it’s easy to do so. You can also import flight plans by scanning your boarding pass or from the boarding pass stored in Apple’s Wallet app; on the back of the pass, just tap Share Pass, then tap App in the Air. If you’re into tracking your travel, let App in the Air do the heavy lifting. It can log miles, hours, airport, and more. You can also earn badges for your achievements. There’s even a whimsical award for Time Travel, but you’ll need to supply your own flux capacitor. To help you get through airports more efficiently, App in the Air includes maps and crowdsourced wait times for check-in, passport processing, and security. If you’re still using scraps of paper to track what to pack, you might like App in the Air’s editable packing list. App in the Air can help you track loyalty points for airlines, hotels, rental cars, and other entities, but the feature is relatively limited, particularly for U.S. airlines. It also requires creating yet another account, with Points Loyalty Wallet. There’s a lot to like in App in the Air and there’s likely more to come. The cost to enable the additional features provided by the subscription isn’t cheap. But if you fly regularly, the lifetime subscription is probably a worthwhile bet to place, since the app receives regular feature updates. I highly recommend App in the Air. Kayak -- Now owned by Priceline, the free Kayak app boasts a long list of travel-related features. Most notably, it helps you find and book flights, hotel rooms, and rental cars and provides a top-notch interface. You can filter your searches by a multitude of categories, including price, non-stop flights, car type, hotel brands, amenities, and much more. When the search results are presented you can book them, or in the case of flights and hotel rooms, set up a price alert. Kayak does a nice job suggesting whether it makes sense to buy an airline ticket immediately, or to wait a while and see if prices come down. Kayak takes travel planning a step further with its Explore feature. You set parameters for your trip, such as a budget, time of year, location, and activities, and Kayak responds with suggestions. Along with all the basics, once a trip is created, you can also add related events and details such as meetings, dinners, and local transportation, a plus for business travelers. One-upping App in the Air, Kayak automatically creates a calendar feed with all your itineraries, so if information about the trip changes, it’s automatically updated in your calendar. To get the URL for the calendar feed, you’ll need to log in to Kayak on the Web and look in Trips Settings. Kayak recently added the capability to import booking confirmations automatically from Gmail accounts. That’s a nice improvement, but like Google Trips, it works only with Gmail while App in the Air and TripIt can sift through the inboxes of many more email services. Kayak provides a number of other niceties: Kayak’s flight tracker isn’t limited to just the flights you travel on. You can track any flight you want; that’s helpful if you’re the one making the airport run to pick up Grandma. It can automatically share all new trips with others via email. Kayak even provides the option of letting others edit the trip, which would be useful for an administrative aide to add a meeting for a traveling boss. When you add a hotel manually to an itinerary, Kayak automatically fills in the address, phone number, and URL for the property. Hotel details include a section on nearby restaurants (courtesy of OpenTable, another Priceline company) and a Show Driver button that displays the hotel address to show a driver if there’s a language barrier. In addition to email, SMS, and notifications, Kayak can also send flight status alerts via Facebook Messenger. You can use autofill for your contact info, pulling your data out of your Contacts app with a couple of taps. These autofill settings can be kept in sync through iCloud. So if you change any of your contact info — say, your home address — you can change it on one device and let iCloud handle the syncing with the rest of your devices. Kayak is the only app of the bunch that has an Apple TV app. That makes it easier for people to do travel planning together… and I’ll bet those shots of the French Riviera on a 60-inch TV screen are enticing. While it’s a good fit for personal travel, Kayak also works well for business travelers, who can use the app to include meetings and other events in their itineraries, follow flight plans of co-workers, and allow others to edit their trips. If you’re looking for a single app to plan, book, and manage travel, you can’t go wrong with Kayak, especially given that it’s entirely free. TripCase -- Our next entry is TripCase, which is owned by Sabre — perhaps the first company to get into the real-time, computer-based air travel booking business. TripCase provides a full array of travel management tools, including several that target business travelers. Unlike the other apps, after you set up an account and complete your profile (which you must do to use TripCase), TripCase doesn’t search through your email for travel info and automatically build itineraries. Instead, you either: Forward email confirmation messages with travel info to trips@tripcase.com or enter the details manually. Use a TripCase affiliate to do bookings, in which case, the details will automatically be added to your account. An affiliate is any airline, travel agency, company travel department, or supplier that uses TripCase’s technology to automatically import reservations into a traveler’s TripCase account. Unfortunately, there’s no list of affiliates to be found online or in the app, so your results may be hit and miss. Neither of these is as friction-free as having the app look through your inbox. And the mystery surrounding the affiliates isn’t good, either — two demerits. Once you have a trip built, you can add activities such as meetings, restaurants, and attractions, and the app provides access to Uber, airport maps, weather, and other information right within the trip. Separate screens provide links to restaurants and things to see and do at your destination. TripCase offers the usual trappings, such as push/email alerts and the capability to share trips with others, although updates other than flight changes are not sent automatically to people you designate. However, if those people sign up for TripCase, your trip appears in a convenient Following list, with full updates — a handy feature for business travelers. On the calendar side, TripCase lets you do a one-time import of your trips, or it can create a calendar feed that will update itself. Of course, there’s more: TripCase shows a Tripfeed in its details screen that may include helpful information such as a link to an airport map or ads that suggest you buy various trip-related items such as travel insurance, an audiobook for the flight, and an airport lounge ticket. Unfortunately, there’s no way to turn off the ads with an in-app purchase. TripCase offers (for a $5.99 in-app purchase good for a year after a 1-month trial period) the capability of storing images of your receipts as PDF files to save time when filling out expense reports, a welcome feature for business travelers. You can use TripCase to search for alternate flights for future trips you have planned. An Apple Watch app displays an itinerary as well as nearby locations. But while the complication appears in the list contained in the Watch app, it would not appear as an option under the Faces section of the app. TripCase is clearly built for business travelers. But it feels incredibly dated in terms of look and feel and lacks too many standard features that its counterparts have. Unless your company mandates its use, I recommend looking elsewhere because there are better options. TripIt -- As with a couple of the other apps, TripIt is part of a larger company’s travel portfolio. It’s owned by Concur Technologies, which provides travel and expense management services to businesses. Concur also owns Hipmunk, another app that can book flights and hotels. Combine the two and you have a travel solution aimed squarely at business travelers. TripIt has all the basics covered and, like Kayak and TripCase, you can manually beef up your itineraries with additional travel plans, such as train or ferry trips, and activities like meetings or theater outings. TripIt provides a calendar feed that maintains updated itineraries in your calendar app. You can share trips, which isn’t unusual, but TripIt allows you to share only parts of your itinerary, so you could choose to share flight info but not hotel arrangements, for example. For $49 per year, you can upgrade to TripIt Pro and get flight status alerts by text or email, reward tracking with a number of vendors, check-in reminders, automatic trip sharing, flight refund monitoring, and more. That cost is higher than what other apps charge, but you can try TripIt Pro for 30 days for free. TripIt is big on social via its Network feature, offering a dizzying array of options, including: You can post travel plans to LinkedIn, Facebook, Yammer, and Salesforce Chatter. You can add connections to other people either manually or through your Google or Yahoo email accounts. Once connections are made, you and your connection can each see summaries of each other’s trips. In addition, TripIt can spot when connections are near each other when travel plans overlap. TripIt Pro users can create an “inner circle,” members of which see your detailed itineraries and get automatic notifications when you create new trips. People in your inner circle do not have to be TripIt Pro users and trip information is shared only from you to them, not the other way. You can optionally choose to allow an inner circle member to edit your trips, which might be handy if your assistant regularly handles such details anyway. You can designate individual trips as private to avoid sharing trip information, even with your inner circle. And that’s not all: TripIt stores an extended set of profile info, including space for travel documents like your passport, TSA Pre, CLEAR, and driver license. It can also store travel-related contacts such as emergency contacts, house sitters, boarding kennels, and so on. Like App in the Air, TripIt can track basic travel stats. There are no medals for achievements, though. You can create groups for free. People with email addresses with the same domain (think companies) can use a shared calendar to coordinate travel schedules and see other group members’ trips and locations on a map. Trips can also be made private. For $29 per month for up to 10 users (with prices scaling up to $159 per month for 100 users), an organization can subscribe to TripIt for Teams, which offers the group features above along with team-wide spending reports and a travel dashboard that shows all of the team’s travel plans in one place. It’s best suited for an organization that has a department arranging travel for others. TripIt is solid on all fronts and works equally well for both personal and business travel. If you travel a lot, the Pro features are a must-have. Unless you have a big problem with using a separate app to book travel, TripIt has you covered. Book It -- Let’s wrap it up. All five of these apps can work for personal travel, but Kayak, App in the Air, and TripIt are clearly ahead of Google Trips and TripCase thanks to a more complete set of features. Kayak and TripIt are best suited for business travelers given their capability to add other activities to trip itineraries, and the inclusion of TripIt’s $49 Pro package gives it a slight edge over Kayak for business travelers. With its features that appeal to groups and teams, TripIt is the best option for organizations that need to manage complex travel calendars and costs, bolstering its position as the best app for business travelers.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: The Google Assistant, Google's voice assistant that powers the Google app on Android phones, tablets, and Google Home, has just gotten a major downgrade. In a move reminiscent of all the forced and user-hostile Google+ integrations, Google has gutted the Google Assistant's shopping list functionality in order to turn it into a big advertisement for Google's shopping site, Google Express. The shopping list has been a major feature of the Google Assistant. You can say "Add milk to my shopping list," and the Google Assistant would dutifully store this information somewhere. The shopping list used to live in Google Keep. Keep is Google's primary note-taking app, making it a natural home for the shopping list with lots of useful tools and management options. Now the shopping list lives in Google Express. Express is an online shopping site, and it has no business becoming a dedicated place to store a shopping list that probably has nothing to do with Google's online marketplace. Since Google Express is an online shopping site (and, again, has no business having a note-taking app grafted onto it), the move from Keep to Google Express means the Assistant's shopping list functionality loses the following features: Being able to reorder items with drag and drop; Reminders; Adding images to the shopping list; Adding voice recordings to the shopping list; Real time collaboration with other users (Express has sharing, but you can't see other people as they type -- you have to refresh.); Android Wear integration; Desktop keyboard shortcuts; Checkbox management: deleting all checked items, unchecking all items, hiding checkboxes. Alternatively, the move from Keep to Google Express means the Assistant shopping list gains the following features: Google Express advertising next to every list item; Google Express advertising at the bottom of the page. android google software ← You may like to read: → Sir Tim Berners-Lee Lays Out Nightmare Scenario Where AI Runs the Financial World Silicon Valley Investors Call For California To Secede From the US After Trump Win Twitters Says It Will Ban Trump If He Breaks Hate-Speech Rules Ask Slashdot: Would You Recommend Updating To Windows 10?

For example, it used to work from any screen so I could tell it "OK Google, dial {phone number I see on the screen}" or "OK Google, search for {thing I see on screen}" It also can't identify songs. It even has a special message where it tells me that feature isn't supported yet. That was a strange response since that was the first indication I had that the program I was using had been replaced.

Google Assistant's new shopping list is live, here's how it works Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/10 7:00pm PDTApr 10, 2017 58 Plus 1 on G+ 99 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares231 Applications Google News When Google Assistant was first introduced, you could ask it to add items to your personal shopping list. This would create a note called 'Google Assistant shopping list' in Google Keep, and you could easily manage your list from the Keep app (or web app). It makes sense that your shopping list would be in the same app as your notes, right? Apparently not to Google, because two days ago, a support article was updated to say the shopping list is moving out of Keep. Why? Because the new list ties into Google Express, so you can order what you need in fewer steps. That doesn't make the change any less stupid, but that's the reason.    When you ask Assistant to add something to your list, it is now added to the Google Express shopping list. You can actually have multiple shopping lists, and set any of them as the default. You can also share lists with other Google accounts, and they can easily add or remove items (which was a bit buggy with Keep lists). You might notice that some items (like the Vitamin Water in the above screenshot) have a tiny umbrella icon. When you tap it, it will link you to the product on Google Express. I guess that's useful? But there are some major problems with this implementation too. Unless you have the Google Express app installed, your shopping list is opened in a Chrome Custom Tab. Google could have easily added this to the Google app, but they didn't. One of my favorite aspects of the Keep list was being able to check items off with my watch (through the Android Wear Keep app). Even if you have the Express app installed, there's no way to access the list from Android Wear. In addition, adding items to the shopping list through Google Now still adds them to Keep. So in summary, the new shopping list implementation is two steps forward, one step back. Feel free to vent your frustration in the comments below.

So now my Google Assistant shopping list in Keep has been gimped because... no reason at all. Todd Johnson That's what I thought when I was reading this article... What the F@&% is Google Express, look it up and yeah good work Google, change a feature that people use to something that people don't use... They are releasing the Google Home in the UK and it doesn't look like Google Express is available there? So what, UK users won't be able to use the feature? I bought a Google Home about 1.5weeks ago and am waiting for it to arrive. Yay! Upon reading the below comments, I suppose we could name a list as Coles list or Woolies List... But that is such a stupid work around! EDIT: And it's a monthly subscription!!!! "Google Express membership is $10/month or $95/year after your trial." - https://www.google.com/express/u/0/about Alex To be honest, the only difference for those of us without Express is that it opens up the shopping list in Chrome instead of Keep. That's a bit disadvantageous, but I'm also the only person I know that even knows Keep exists, let alone uses it, so nothing will significantly change. It's a weird move to tie it to this app/service that isn't even available in the region that they just launched Home in, though. I don't really follow why, if they were going to do anything, they didn't just make it a part of the Google Home app itself. All they've done is remove one bodge of tying it to another app/service and changed it to another bodge of tying it to another app/service - except this app can't even be downloaded here... akshay7394 > That's a bit disadvantageous, but I'm also the only person I know that even knows Keep exists, let alone uses it, so nothing will significantly change. I strongly disagree. What about offline-syncing? This current implementation always opens a chrome custom tab. I, for example, would always use it such that I'd note what I needed and then, later, refer to Keep (which has it sync'd offline) to see and check-off what I need and bought. Alvar Lagerlof It is possible till make offline websites. But they haven't Alex I'd assume the app previously opened Keep up in a browser too if you didn't have it installed (which would seem to be more common than not, from my anecdotal experience) - so for a lot of people it won't be any different. It's surprising that they wouldn't use Chrome's offline ability though. Has anyone actually tested it to find out? xxTheGoDxx Google Keep has 100 to 500 million users... tabguy2 Since that's the "only difference" what you're saying is that I'll still be able to see the list on my Android Wear watch? demarcmj FWIW, the price is competitive with Amazon Prime. That doesn't solve the availability issue of course. Cory S Prime offers a whole lot more than shipping. Express doesn't even scratch the surface of product availability, or benefits. If they tossed in Red, and Play Music, it be somewhat comparable...but even then. demarcmj Some people may find the overnight or sometimes same day delivery outweighs or at least balances the difference in number of products. Plus, you can get groceries from this, which Amazon charges extra for and doesn't even have competitive prices on. I'd say for the shipping aspect at least, the services both have pros and cons and which one is "better" would depend on the needs of the person. I'll give you the fact that Prime has a bunch of other services bundled in with it, but I suspect that a large percentage of people don't even use those. Cory S Express doesn't offer any perishable good on the grocery front...So it's of limited use there. Amazon doesn't charge extra for prime now which includes far more in the grocery selection area. It just has a minimum purchase price of 20 dollars. However, it does have a tip suggestion (which is optional) which I find annoying. PAY YOUR DRIVERS AMAZON. demarcmj All true... although Prime Now is only available in a small number of major cities. My point in comparing it to prime was simply directed at Todd Johnson's incredulity that "it's a monthly subscription!!!!" (four exclamation points). Of course it's a monthly subscription! bekifft Do yourself a favor and return it / cancel the order while you can. Jon Edge I would demand my money back.

If I am at the store I don't need to be reminded I have a list...I need a good list app that ideally is shareable and syncs with the person shopping with me. Teja "Okay Google, show me my shopping list" should work though. Anyways I also prefer Keep integration as the list can be a shared list. MatchstickMan Ah shit, using voice assistant? That's actually a pretty good point, I'll keep that in mind. Teja Damn! you're good at sarcasm. I just gave you an alternative for "I now have to open Home, click the sidebar menu, then select shopping list and wait for the Chrome tab to load up!" I do agree that a Google Keep widget is a simpler way to access the list rather than a voice command. Especially when you have people around, as it would be awkward to talk to your phone. :P MatchstickMan Haha! I really didn't mean for it to come off as maliciously sarcastic as I'm now reading it. I sincerely never considered it! nside1 The Google app (Google search box widget) still allows me to add items to my Google keep shopping list, will that change? Corbin Davenport No idea. Nicolas Finn From the article: "In addition, adding items to the shopping list through Google Now still adds them to Keep." David Hyman Hopefully this evolves quickly into something great. Adding a widget and launcher shortcuts should make getting there very easy. And if this allows me to better manage the items on my list I'm all in. I really want to be able to ask is peanut butter on my list and have assistant say "yes" instead of just reading me my entire list Grey So "hope all the lost functionality is restored"? David Hyman Yep, pretty much all of us can hope for at this point dylan-m Of course, not living in the United States, I don't have the Google Express app. (Not that most people do anyway). So I get the dumb website instead. First thing I notice is you can add other lists. Interesting. And yet if I say "add foo to my to do list" it adds to a new list in Google Keep anyway. So apparently this feature only applies to lists with names like "shopping list." Brilliant, Google. Top notch interface design, as ever. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard Google services killed the first born children of the Google Assistant team. That's why they don't like integrating with Google services. It's personal for them. Booyabobby I rather the list stay on Keep. supersanborn The original clunky approach of being unable to use an existing keep shopping lift has been made clunkier.

Grey Nope you have to buy from Google Express. Also, not telling you what Google Express is. newtonfb God dammit.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio Being an Android Site you guys should be used to Google going 2 steps forward and 1 step back. It's called Job Security. Marty McWong Just as an aside, are many Nexus 5X/6P owners are still waiting for Assistant to roll out? I've yet to receive it, and if it makes a difference I'm on 7.1.2 (via the beta), no root and with an apparently up to date (7.6.08...) Play Store... Grey Check your settings Marty McWong Oh, re-reading the original AP article (http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/02/google-assistant-coming-android-6-0-devices/) I see they mention checking language settings... Mine is set to English UK, so that's probably it (I'll check after work), thanks! Grey "Can't we just add Google Express support to Keep?" "You're fired." create812 Get your logic out of here! Kevin Sword relevant CoffeeZombie I like Keep. I have a shared shopping list on Keep with my wife. We can both add things to it and take things off that we've bought. We both have access to it at the store. I could use it from my watch while at the store, which was always nice. Google Now knew how to add items to this shared list, too. It was super convenient. "Oh, we're out of milk! Okay, Google, add milk to my shopping list." Done! Then Assistant came. I tried adding an item to the shopping list...and it created a new Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. WTF? I already have a shopping list, that's what I want to use. So, basically, I guess this doesn't affect me at this point because I've already had my nice, voice-activated shopping list taken away from me. I'll just stick with manually adding things in Keep and remembering back in 2004 when Google was cool... Rob Using Voice Search (Google Now) you can still add items to Keep! Abhimanyu Seth Since I found wunderlist, never looked at another app for shopping lists! Jose Romero More renewed focus on Google Express. This gives me a little bit more hope that Google might one day make a "Google Prime" that at least includes Google Express, Google Movies, and Google Music in the yearly subscription cost. Wynnded Keep app just got an update, lol. James Briano "OK, Google, add an iPhone to my shopping list." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No kidding. I'm getting more and more tempted to switch. Indefinite Implosion As someone with a work iPhone and only a Nexus 4 that has no SIM and little battery, don't. I miss Android. There's so many things about Android that I miss and have no good replacement for (such as Nine mail for Exchange). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ My kids have iPhones and I think they're terrific. I'd be happy with one, only I really like the S Pen too much to switch. But if Google pisses me off enough, I will switch. JD Do it you'll feel better, way less frustrated. Portzblitz You CAN'T use Google Express in about 5,292 US cities, sooo.. Is the wisdom of this intentionally hidden from us, or does this really, truly do no one- including Google- any good? b_boogey_xl *rabble rabble rabble* this one change ruins everything. how will I go on with life, my shopping list is ruined… *rabble rabble rabble* 🙄 disqus_3Gy5bmHRAv Yet another example of Google's haphazard policies towards apps. Android has become a complete frustration. The apps work differently on different devices, an app can be killed off at any minute based on a whim and important apps do not get enough attention because of Google's philosophy: Try everything, master nothing. Teja I need an option to add tasks to a to do list in keep through Google Assistant. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher R.I.P. shopping with my watch :-( http://i.imgur.com/RuHrQnK.jpg There is still a way, much more complicated: 1. Make sure NOT to install Google Express 2. Open shopping list on the phone 3. Select all → Copy 4. Open Google Keep 5. Create new list 6. Paste 7. Remove extra line spacing → Now you can still use your watch in the store. Thank you Google. DragoCubed It makes total sense for a shopping list to be in keep. Google is trying to make itself a mess. I shouldn't be used to this Google, I shouldn't be afraid to recommend a Google messaging app. James Bray I am in the UK, and I'm not able to download the Google Express App, so I need to use the website. This wouldn't be the end of the world if I could get any mobile service in my local supermarket! With this change, they effectively just removed this feature from me entirely. I only set it up on the 6th because that's when the Home came out! Annoyed! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher See my other comment, you can still copy/paste the list to Keep Tamil Arasan A new assistant for me making things simple!!! Stefan Weißhampel It's a stupid move, especially for international users who simply use the US assistant because it is a few steps ahead of the several international versions. I'm not going to order eggs from the US. Empraim can the new shopping list give me location based notifications like Keep could? It was the best feature that my phone would buzz, giving me my shopping list as I entered the supermarket Filipe Santos They make a move thinking on everyone but in the end Google Express only exist on a very very few countries.... Filipe Santos Ok Google stop being an asshole and release Google assistant for everyone myssi How about they had updated Google Keep to have a little Google Express badge on any list item buyable from express while person in supported country and zip area?? Now even on saying "Create a list" on Google Assitant makes a Google Express list -___- Chicachica Wow what a load of crap, they took an awesome feature and instead of improving it, made it much worse. I sent feedback in the apps. Hopefully when enough people bitch like that they will change it back... Jason Pagliaro Sent detailed feedback as well. Unlikely that we'll see any change but worth a shot. Crossstick Ten thumbs down. It was perfect as a Keep interface. Now we have to manually enter items in a Keep shopping list. Brilliant, Google. Albert R I think you got that reversed: this is one step forward, two steps back. Albert R Just like killing of reader, the Hangouts chrome extension, and when they stopped using xmpp for chat. They really need better product direction/someone with common sense. makapav You're giving them too much credit - they actually lack any product direction. David Dalrymple This was not a well - thought decision. I hope Google rethinks this decision. bdbplatano Google is the dumbest smart company out there Martin Send your ANGRY thoughts to Google from the Assistant's FEEDBACK :-))) Let them know at least how much they SUCK... :-))) P.S: Don't expect change, it's not like Google ever gives a sh*t about their users... They are just dumb and ignorant most of the time :) makapav Feedback? I have up on it years ago. All that Hangouts feedback went to shit. They came up with Allo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Obvious attempt to get you to shop using Google Express instead of Amazon. SavageJeep and... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And it won't work. All this will do is piss off people who used Keep for shopping lists. SavageJeep I use Express. I use Amazon. Ordering stuff off my list makes sense. That is their intent and yes it is a business decision. EDIT: spelling Bodah My biggest complaint is that you can no longer reorder the list. In my usage, I would add items throughout the week, and then reorder the list based on the layout of the store before I left. That way I wouldn't be going from one end of the store to the other because I happened to add grapes at the end of the week. demarcmj You realize that's not an "umbrella icon" right? Graham Newman I was already disliking the way that assistant added reminders were not added to keep. But im a new convert from iOS. I thought keep was great at keeping reminders gathered in one place rather than spread all over my calendar but I just need to try to get used to it. I don't like the cal app much. Metal_Link Disappointed for the same reason as the author... Can't see my list on my watch. Ugh. Navarr Barnier two forward, one back? This is more like one forward two back. Aaron Dishman https://giphy.com/gifs/superstore-lauren-ash-26ueYRXkmpTVsB7K8 Kakairo It looks like I can share the list if I view it in a web browser, but not when I view it in Google Express. The hell? This was one of our most used features in the house, it will take a lot of getting used to. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Google giveth and the Google taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Google. (This change is a transparent attempt to compete with Amazon.) create812 What is Google Express? Why can't I see my list on my watch? Why can't I check items off? How can my SO and I collaborate on the same shopping list? Oh no Google WHAT! is you doing? Roberto Virga "... have a tiny umbrella icon" From "don't be evil" to "resident evil": Google has now become Umbrella Corp. :D JD I can imagine the Google Lunch room now. You got different cliques sitting at different tables. None of them are allowed to sit in different cliques, you sit with your own and that's it. You got the G-Home Table, The Android Table, Android Wear table etc, G-Apps. Each one planning how to shank the other like in a prison. Then you have the guys who are in charge of Adopting Material design in to G-Apps walking around outside like giant chickens pecking at the ground crowing randomly at passerbys. Roy So they're basically removing the two things that I love about using keep for this: Android Wear Sharing the list with my wife (her phone has yet to get google assistant and neither of us can get the Google Express app). Good job Google. It must be nice to be able to consistently ignore and piss off your users because we're not really your customers, your advertisers are. Well, I hope one day you realize that your products will move to greener pastures when a company comes around that can do what you do but doesn't see us as widgets to be sold to advertisers, but as people that are the foundation of your income. Advertisers won't pay you a dime if you have no one to show their ads to! Cecil Hardwood Why are you guys surprised or disappointed ? This is Google. Look at messaging and reminders. Those are all over the place too. Google is becoming more and more incompetent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome sucks now. It used to be my favorite browser. Unfortunately, there's no competition anymore. Edge sucks more. Firefox works great but is slow as fark. Opera is great, but it's based on Chrome. Merf This is as bad as it sounded. Vons Records Good move, Google. Now I'm back to having zero reasons to interact with the assistant. Except for telling it to shut up when it overhears me setting up the backup phone I use for flashing ROMs. R.J. Great, no widget for Express as well, so my shopping list isn't viewable with all my other notes on my home screen. Glich damit i use a extra home screen of my phone as one big keep wigget for my shopiing list. o well so much for that David Lloyd Thomas Sucks because Google Express isn't available in the UK! No way of accessing the list without adding something to it 😕😕 Jon Edge Maybe this has already been posted...I didn't read all the comments. I'm not saying this will solve everyone's issues, but it's at least a work around I can live with. Once the list is launched, you can pin it to your homescreen. That makes it easily accessible, As a matter of fact, it's one step shorter than accessing through Keep (unless you keep that list open all the time). Just now, I copied the address of that Chrome Tab and emailed that to myself. I launched that link on Chrome on my desktop and now I have that bookmarked in my Bookmarks Bar. Pretty easy access to my list on mobile and desktop. I can live with that. Who cares if they have integrated this new list with Google Express. Use it or don't. That really shouldn't be an issue for anyone. I'll bet this is only temporary anyway and that eventually this finds its way into the Google Home app (or somewhere else). LondonLeedsFan Is Google Express their attempt at Prime then? I wouldn't know as don't think it's in the UK. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes. They want to compete with Amazon Prime because you can order stuff with the Amazon Echo. h4rr4r I don't understand the issue here. Just use keep, who the heck wants to yell at their phone? surethom No express in the UK & cellular signel In supermarkets is very bad so shopping list DOES NOT work in UK as it uses a web link, we NEED an offline sync version. xxTheGoDxx So, summarize: Google relies now on app not available outside of the US Express doesn't work on Android Wear, nor tablets from what I have read. You can instead open your shopping list in Chrome, which means you won't have access to it if the page / app reloads or you miss click unless you have a working data connection in your local grocery store / super market. Good job guys! BTW, when does your next totally useless messaging app launch? And have you ever thought about moving the ability to take selfies into Google Keep instead of the camera app? That would be so cool. thereasoner Perhaps Wear support is coming shortly?

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 134 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares270 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company. I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine CF542 6 months? I replaced my S7E three times in four months for chronic and various problems before giving up and going Pixel blueman24 "Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES." "I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge" "Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months." You brought a $700 S7edge and not a $300 oneplus, so it should not be acceptable for it to become less responsive after 6 months? Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. WARLORD VIII On the up side the Pixel isn't catching on fire 😎 das I thought that was a feature for survivalists. :P Eric Works for me. The most stable software wise of any phone I've ever used. Paid 300 for mine and prefer it over the s7. Curved screens don't like screen protector. Nothing like water resistant on a phone that looks like a cat danced on it. Another huge plus is the lack of carrier spam. I'm not getting all the complaints. Google showed us we'd be getting if we choose to buy it. I for one have no regrets about doing so. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. Kristian Ivanov I'm not going to comment on the actual design, I want to hear thoughts comparing it to the undesputed legend - Nexus 5 (design only) JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. CF542 The only thing that the S7/S8 truly suffer from is having Samsung as a parent. They turned the phone (s) into a piece of bloatware full of crappy software that nobody wants. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Ryan Those are usability preferences. I will agree the settings are a freaking nightmare to find, but I dont go into settings often. Right now, and for over a year now, bluetooth audio has been straight-up broken. They implemented that absoloute volume BS without coding how to handle devices that dont send volume information, breaking it in my car. Then the idiots put developer setting that is to allow you to disable it but they didnt even test it and the user doesnt have permissions to change that setting, so the switch does nothing. That is a BIG bug, and one that Google has refused to address for over a year. Then there is the fact that my phone, and the first Nexus phone I have had to deal with this on, has to be rebooted every few weeks because it slows down horribly. Jack Smith Based on what? Had every iPhone since the 3G and relatively recently added Android as carry both and Android is excellent. So much is written is just simply not true. Suggest actually give recent Android a try and you might be surprised ;). Ryan Ive had android for coming up on 8 years, HTC Hero was the first, then one more HTC before going Nexus. Been on Nexus and still am with my 5x. I know, personally, some of the MAJOR shortcomings of Googles implementation of Android. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. ScratchC The problem with the Internet is how do I know you actually own one? Or are you just a troll. In any case, I unfortunately had to pass on the Pixel my S6 shit the bed and I had just upgraded to the S7. My gf tho.. I somehow convinced her to grab a Pixel on Verizon. She has not had not 1 issue. I'm not saying they don't exist. It's just not as bad as commenters trying to win an argument make it seem. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of the 22 Pixel photos had halos. None of the LG G6 photos had halos. whispy_snippet Wow. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. Vega007 My Pixel is, by far, the best phone I have ever had for battery life. Christopher Bement I'm only going with devices I've actually used, I haven't touched a Pixel personally. All I can say is it's day and night between the N6 and S7 on a given work day where I'm calling, texting and emailing almost constantly. Vega007 That's a good point, it all depends on what phone we have used to compare it to. I have never used a S7 Edge, but I have used a S7. While the battery life was fine, the Pixel does do better for my usage (I'm using the 5" btw). And that's the real key to battery issue is personal use. We all use our devices differently so battery life will always be subjective. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. ScratchC The iPhone has been in trouble for some time. It's why it started playing catch up (Forget current sales up to now. Poll after poll, iPhone users are bored of iPhones) Actually Google's Android is in trouble as well. Samsung is doing their own thing. Google needs to put it's foot down or compete. The Pixel is an attempt to do so. It's not perfect by any means. it's better than nothing and it was a solid first entry. If you simply don't like it.. Buy elsewhere. that's the beauty of Android. I think you guys forget, that out of our fanboy bubble, most people when they think of Android have a distinct definition. I'm talking the average consumer...they think Android = cheap phone from prepaid carrier that's slow, plastic, horrible camera & full of bugs. Or.. Android = Samsung Galaxy. Your average consumer still doesn't know what a Pixel is nvm that they don't even know what a Nexus was. Android phones need to be a premium product to compete. They need to charge the amount of money it takes for proper R&D.. Customer support etc. Google cannot sell at a loss and accomplish this. This very reason is why Samsung holds the Android crown. Regardless of your opinion towards their devices. Remember that Carrier subsidizing is how Galaxy devices sell by the millions. Iphones as well. Google is on the right path. They just need to bring the next Pixel to all carriers. Lindsay Meyer You're right. I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved those iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices), and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick (and their new iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to throw my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability, and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. mrjayviper Fairly new? How long have they been selling Nexus phones and other devices? MJ Let me get this straight... You left a comment without reading the whole discussion? I already very clearly laid out an actual argument but thanks for your input. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. madcanada That's correct, I'm pissed that Pixel gets a better camera software while Nexus is fundamentally the same in the department. I understand your point about camera being a combination of both hardware and software, but unlike, say, Apple, where each iteration is actually better in terms of hardware, and older iPhones still get whatever features they can physically run, Google decided to accentuate the difference by simply denying their last year phone the same updates. Where Apple only denies updates when the old phone can't actually handle them Google is simply abandoning their last year model to justify the price of the Pixel. whispy_snippet Except there's one key difference. Unlike iPhones that release each year, the Nexus 6P is not of the Pixel lineage. The Pixel is the first of its kind. madcanada That makes not a shred of difference in the argument I'm making. I find denying last year phone updates it perfectly capable of running, so you can justify the price of the new phone ethically questionable. I don't care if they rebranded, their decision to not give Nexus the updates it can handle is only guided by the fact that they wanted to charge twice the price for Pixel, and they couldn't have if Nexus got the goodies. whispy_snippet Ethically questionable? No, mate, it's business. Google's ultimate responsibility is maximising profits for shareholders. You're cranky that your 6P can't do what the more expensive a Pixel can do. Now imagine how Pixel owners would feel if they saw cheaper, older phones from the same company doing exactly the same thing as theirs. Again, I sympathise to an extent, but ultimately you get what you pay for. If you want the Pixel experience, buy it. madcanada I'm not cranky because my Nexus 6P can't do things Pixel can, on the contrary, I get full Pixel experience with free unlimited full size photo upload, Pixel launcher, Pixel camera, and day one Google Assistant on Nexus 6P. I'm cranky because I need to go to XDA to get them goodies. I understand it's business, but if you want to sell charge twice for the phone - sell a better phone, give us a better camera, bigger battery life, and don't downgrade our goddamn speakers. whispy_snippet Mate, you're simply not making sense anymore. You're effectively wanting something for nothing. You want Google to give you a Pixel quality camera experience on an older, less expensive phone from an entirely different lineage - for free. You're not entitled to free stuff. I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree. madcanada you can disagree all your want, i outlined my gripe with Google in the first post, then you decided to argue about the camera. New lineage or not, when you market Nexus as the phone that gets all the Google love, and then you just leave users behind right next generation simply to justify the price hike of new Pixel - that's low. Apple's feature fragmentation is driven solely by the hardware - newer phones get new exclusive features because older models can't do the same thing physically. Google is creating artificial fragmentation in order to justify twice the price. That's not the Google I remember and that's not the direction I like. Obviously it's their choice. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? Mix Sounds like you have not done this before because sending your phone to Google first, waiting for them to get it and look it over THEN sending a replacement is, 100%, the bad choice. Having them send you the phone first and put a hold on your creditcard is the better and faster choice! Complaining gets you nothing, USA got free daydream headsets, Canadians got nothing. The phone, after taxes, was $1,320.48 - close enough for me to complain about it at the $1,400 point, lol. John Doe OMG, YOU CAN'T READ? That is what I said Google does but you said you had to wait 7 days for your phone but they send you the phone first then you send yours in so no waiting. Yes I have done this before. With Apple, Google, and other companies...it is standard practice. No, they don't charge you taxes they just put a hold of the price of the phone not your total purchase price. Maybe it is just different in Canada...you should stop buying Google products there *rolls eyes* Lindsay Meyer If your damaged, soon-to-be-returned Pixel phone is broken and unusable, there would indeed be a waiting period to have a working phone in either case, because, being unable to easily switch your device at a physical brick and mortar store, you would be at the mercy of waiting for for Google's mailed replacement to have a working phone again. John Doe Google sens it next day here in the US Mix You straight up told me that I chose the bad option: "Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault." when I did not choose the bad option. If my phone bricked, which it did, and it takes 7 days for Googles phone to get to me I have no phone for 7 days, that is waiting without a phone! I think we are both right, 12 of this and a dozen of that, lol. <3 Stuff in Canada is more expensive and shipping generally sucks. I normally chose 2 day shipping with Amazon and get refunded shipping costs because the shipping companies miss the delivery date constantly. Nexus 4 and 5 have been sweet, my Pixel experience has been garbage. Their customer service has been good though so yay for that. Lindsay Meyer Canadian $ ≠ US $ John Doe Yeah but the phone still does not cost $1,400 in canada so yeah destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I'd far rather spend 5-10 minutes online from home getting my replacement shipped to me for free than having to go into a store, talk to someone who's less knowledgeable about my phone than I am, convince them to get it replaced, and then pay them an additional $35 to have them facilitate my phone then getting shipped to their store where I have to return to pick it up. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. Aaron Yeah, top notch. Tell that to all those iPhone 6plus users with the death screen disease and Apple does nothing... mrjayviper Out of warranty? I don't think Google supports out of warranty devices to donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. Berni Hargrove Hold on now, Chromebooks are more than good enough if you go price for price on a cheap laptop. There's no way that $200 Windows laptop with 2gigs of ram is performing on the same level as a $200 Chromebook with the same specs. In addition the reason why "Good Enough" applies to this is because the average person wants to pay very little for a computer, but have it be "fast and last a long time" to effectively browse and use Office. Anyone here should know, unless you are getting over on someone, the least you should pay for decent laptop is $500, but the amount of times I've had people in Best Buy whine that that's too expensive for them to just be using Office and small tasks is frequent. Google can make good products that are ready for primetime when they don't have their ass or in the clouds, but sadly as their messaging strategy has showed us, that's increasingly uncommon. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Eric Marciniak Doesn't help that Best Buy has a giant iPhone 7 ad that literally blocks the pixel display from view right when you walk in haha. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8283702e9d03a34df4cfb2bd525ea593d0304d3937690392b7b3acc57eb7620e.jpg Berni Hargrove Best Buy is terrible with product placement. Shit literally changes every season if not more. Good luck finding anything remotely niche on your own. lol Jon E. Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. Berni Hargrove While I agree with a lot of what you said, some of your logic is flawed. Take america for example. There's over 150 million people here. It would take at least 15 million in sales here alone, just to see 1 in 10 people with it. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers. C Lo Good first article Trevor. Welcome aboard. Suyash Bansal I liked the article. 🙃 Orjuan Google Pixels customer service is great if you ask me. It takes like a week to get a replacement, not a month. Also, comparing it to the One Plus 3T is unfair, you didn't mention the superior processing and graphical power and the fact that it gets updates for the next 5-8 years. It also features Google Assistant, which is a big selling point. Add all those up and pixel is worth the extra 400. Plus, I got a regular pixel, with a two year protection plan, 128 GB, and it's still cheaper than iPhone. Google Pixel is a commercial and consumer success. Do your research before spouting out shit, all you did was look at the obvious facts and ignored the small stuff that counts. "UGHHHHH, it has a better camera and that's it.". RESEARCH YOUR TOPICS, Google Pixel is $400 more than One Plus 3T because it's better! Orjuan Plus, Nexus was barely Google at all, they just supplied the best version of Android while hiring an OEM to make the parts and design, while slapping their logo on it. Nexus was good, but not Google's essence, it was a startup for Pixel, which is 100% Google. AJZ16 couldn't care less* usamaisawake I had an entire column of pixels that were not working properly. Thing is my Pixel arrived in the first shipment and I had to leave the country so I didn't umbox it until 4 weeks later. When I called to let them know, they were curious why I waited so long and I explained I hadn't turned it on till just then. They didn't give me any trouble with it and exchanged it right away. They sent the new phone and then after I received it I shipped the old back to them. Perhaps this was still early in the release of the phone so they felt more obligated to make sure the experience was good. Phil Rowley My pixel bricked. I thought Google's customer service (along with bestbuy even though I paid for their stupid geek squad) were horrible. I hate to say it but Verizon was the most helpful and luckily I pay for their monthly insurance. Colin Richardson I miss the Nexus line.. Thankfully I can still buy some Nexus 5X phones (not refurbished). But that will not last. I have no idea what I will do for a phone after that.. I want a Stock Android phone, not a Stock Android Flagship phone. Max Johnson There are plenty of stock-like flagship and non-flagship Android phones. HTC, Sony, Moto and OnePlus are all stock based at varying prices. If you want direct update from Google and good customer service that's a different story, I think that's the main thing now, to get the same quality of support as Apple on Android. I'm surprised to get frequently updates from Sony with latest monthly security patches on my X Compact. Micah T "couldn't* care less." Think about it.... Tr3ple I bought a Pixel XL for 370 and I threw my Galaxy S7 edge in the drawer LMAO 😂 oh Happy day. Sammy Phillips 370 USD? or 370 Euro? Tr3ple USD, bought it 220 with a broken screen and fixed it for 150. So I spent 370. mtz Interesting article however, in the same way Microsoft is not really trying to sell the overpriced Surface Studio , Google is not trying to sell Pixels. Why? Simple. Goole has OEM partners that have supported the Android platform by providing the hardware from the beginning. While it one thing for Google to partner with a carrier each year and release a basic Nexus phone its an entirely different thing for them to release top tier Device and undercut thoes partners on price. Tony Bundy Replied via non-existent really blue Pixel. Yes, wasn't easy but here I am. 😀 Pixel.ization.alism Well precisely Google Blue would be #4285F4 not #4485ED if you would ask. Zuxs13 This was a rather poor opinion piece. You make claims like you can't "easily get a replacement pixel" which is completely untrue. The Apple store is hardly the only place that sells phones and offers good customer service. The OP3T might be readily available, but most consumers have no clue what it is or where to even buy one and would rather buy a phone that is sold at their service provider or local best buy and is supported by 24/hr support service. das "Couldn't care less" - if one *could* care less, than it currently cares. Lindsay Meyer I mentioned this in another thread but feel it probably merits its own post here, coming from the perspective of a disenchanted iPhone user who now owns a Pixel (and is still disenchanted). I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved the iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices) and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick, or worse, new packaging on the same lipstick (and their upgraded iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to hurl my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's kind of a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have more innovative features, but Apple with come right behind it and perfect those features. That's what they do now. Still glad I didn't get the iPhone 7; Apple didn't deserve my business, but Pixel has been a disappointment to me thus far. For the price, I'd prefer my husband's Nexus 6. I think he'd prefer his old HTC if it had front-facing speakers lol. I just don't feel there's a lot of good options out there right now that justify the cost. I have given serious thought to trying to find a replacement comparable to the old Sanyo 6100 (yes, that one) and then throwing an iPad or a tablet in my purse. Maybe even that old B&O phone would be fun. I'm just tired of my need for a smartphone to be continually exploited by these inferior products; half the time they break right after the warranty expires, and like an endentured servant, I'm forced into the process all over again. Also, the fact that this Pixel wants to track everything I do scares the bejeezus out of me. I'm sure Apple has done the same thing more covertly for years, but seeing everything I say, type, search, view, read.. not to mention every place I eat at, travel to or shop.. neatly organized into a little packaged profile makes me feel like a product more than ever. Eliminating Google's permissions to track this info also eliminates much of the Pixel's functionality as a smart phone with fluid communication between apps. I should have probably mentioned this first because I absolutely hate that aspect of it. Renee Looker I don't know about anyone else's opinion on the Pixel phone but I have the Pixel XL Blue and have had it since release. I've not had any issues with my phone, absolutely love it. Really quite eager to see what Google will be releasing next, the rumors are on the rise on what's up next. Nicholas Conrad Great article! techieland You and we are the customers when it come to the Pixel and Pixel Xl. And even the late and great Nexus products to some extent. Personally I think the Pixel phones were a fail, Google should have stuck to making reference level phones to ensure the manufacturers understand what the minimum an Android phone is supposed to be like. Samsung and OnePlus obviously gets it but it seems LG, HTC, & Motorola, are struggling despite all 3 being manufacturers of Nexus/AOSP devices. sgtguthrie *couldn't care less Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 142k 105k Latest Deals 2 [Deal Alert] Order an Amazon gift card valued at $25 or more through Alexa and get a $5 promo credit 2017/04/11 3:50pm PDTApr 11, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Verizon BlackBerry Priv for $259.99 on eBay 2017/04/11 12:35pm PDTApr 11, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Amazon's Gold Box deal has a SanDisk MicroSD 256GB for $120 and a 128GB dual USB-C/A drive for $39 2017/04/11 4:46am PDTApr 11, 2017 35 [Update: Added some more] Deal Alert: Here are some more temporarily free apps and games for your Sunday 2017/04/09 3:05pm PDTApr 9, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Gen LTE for $179.99 ($220 off) on eBay 2017/04/08 7:15pm PDTApr 8, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

SmithPsychology When Bob wakes up in the morning, he can't wait to get downstairs because of how well he is greeted. "Good morning, how am I looking today?" he asks his attentive partner when he arrives in the kitchen. "You're looking great as always," she replies. "What's the weather looking like today?" he asks her, and he receives a detailed forecast complete with predicted high and low temperatures. Looking for a little levity, Bob asks, "Can you tell me a joke?" only to have her tell him, "Sure, you might find this funny… scientists are studying whether people heal faster when they cross their fingers after surgery but it may just be super-stitchin." Bob laughs and as he leaves for work he says goodbye to his supportive partner who replies, "Goodbye, take care, I'll be here for you when you get back." Bob feels like the luckiest man in the world as he heads out to work. You may have already recognized by the content of the responses that Bob's supportive partner is not human but is none other than the Google Home device that uses Google Assistant and utilizes voice recognition software to communicate. Marketed as a "personal assistant", the device is a virtual fountain of "real-time" weather, traffic, finance, sports, business news and more. It will even tell a joke if you want or play a game with you, complete with sound effects! Groundhog Day symbolizes optimism! Scott E.

Smith) Google Home and other similar products such as the Amazon Echo are newer extensions of our former best friend - the smart-phone. We have all been staring at our phones and even communicating verbally with them through Siri, Cortana and Google for several years but now with advances in Artificial Intelligence we can put technology on our countertop that is specifically dedicated to keeping us company and helping us out. What do these developments mean to us for the future? As a society, it appears that we are on the threshold of a wave of first generation robotic companions to help us through our day.

Smith) Numerous private companies have already developed prototypes such as "Buddy" and "Stanley" to be our personal assistants and companions. These companions are designed to listen to us and to speak with us while serving as a source of conversation, information, entertainment, and administrative assistance. As we prepare to enter into this future it raises many questions as to what robots should be like and what they should do and not do. Should they be made to be human-like as in Isaac Asimov's "I-Robot" or should they be distinct machines with their own look? Should they have a value system and morals or be value free? Should they have a personality and if so, what should it be like? Could mechanical companions ever be as satisfying as real humans? Everyone would probably agree that it would be great if robots were able to do housework, make coffee, cook, and clean but what about providing us with meaningful emotional support? One of the exciting aspects of these new companions is their ability to interact with people and provide a "sense" of companionship. It may be that people who were once isolated with little or no human interaction or conversation will now be able to have a vibrant, ongoing, meaningful relationship with their robotic personal assistant! Designers are recognizing that the interactive component of the new technology and the ability to provide emotionally satisfying companionship may ultimately be the most important feature driving future sales. While all the information, news and weather they can provide is great, it may really be the "human-like" interactive component that is most important to people. After all, you can get the news from a variety of sources, but finding steadfast, trustworthy companionship can be much harder. A "companion robot" is defined as a machine that provides us with some type of assistance and interacts with us in a socially and emotionally gratifying manner. A companion robot's primary purpose is to assist humans and to contribute to human life in a positive way. Early prototype efforts are aimed at creating robot assistants that can reciprocally communicate and may be able to help those with special needs such as the elderly, the autistic and the emotionally disabled. While there is much work to do, things have moved far beyond the volleyball, "Wilson" in Tom Hank's movie, Castaway! Imagine how great it would be to have a supportive robot assistant keeping an isolated elderly person company or helping an autistic child. One new robot product, named Pepper, is produced by Aldebaran Robotics and is a classic humanoid robot companion. It is made to look human and programmed to provide personal assistance by supplying requested information, making decisions, and even detecting facial expressions and communicating reciprocally. Robots like this are becoming capable of recognizing emotions and even asking, "Are you feeling sad?" Some present-day robots are already able to roam about the house when you're not home and alert the security system if there is an intruder. Or if an elderly person falls and needs help, a robot can now call 911 for them. As further proof that we have come a long, long way since mobile vacuum cleaners like Roomba, one new robot product produced by Mobley Robotics is able to interact with people and cook up to 2000 meals! Just tell him what you want to eat and put the ingredients out and voila, mom's apple pie is ready! You may want to look around you today and make a mental note of how things are because the world is about to change with the advent of mechanical companions. It is an interesting fact that humans can emotionally bond with inanimate objects and this forms the basis for a robot's emotional appeal. There appears to be no doubt that robots have a future role in being good listeners and emotionally comforting to us. Of all the roles that robots may have in the future, being a good friend to humans might be the most important one. Just ask Bob, who is in love with his Google Home device! Scott E.

Rebecca Davis Rebecca Davis Rebecca Davis studied at Rhodes University and Oxford before working in lexicography at the Oxford English Dictionary. After deciding she’d rather make up words than define them, she returned to South Africa in 2011 to write for the Daily Maverick, which has been a magnificilious decision.   South Africa 11 Apr 2017 11:27 (South Africa) President Jacob Zuma used his address at Monday’s memorial for SACP leader Chris Hani to tell the nation that the remainder of his presidency will see government gunning hard for “radical socio-economic transformation”. Is such talk a populist attempt to deflect from current leadership scandals? Is it an attempt to co-opt the rhetoric of the EFF? Or is it the logical evolution of the ANC’s principled stance since democracy? REBECCA DAVIS takes a look. Google has a nifty little tool called Ngram Viewer. You can use it to see at what historical point a word or phrase was most popular. Type in your query, and it searches a body of over 5-million books published in English between 1800 and 2008 to determine when a particular concept started trending. If you plug in “radical economic transformation”, you’ll find that the phrase first appears in the Google books corpus around 1926 – possibly linked to the first and only British General Strike of that year. From 1926, the prevalence of the phrase builds slowly and unevenly to an all-time high in 1996. By 2008, when Google’s data in this instance unfortunately ends, its use is on the decline again, appearing at levels last seen in 1986. If you could crunch the numbers for South Africa right now, however, that graph would be spiking hard. Radical economic transformation is the phrase du jour. Most recently, it received an airing from President Jacob Zuma during Chris Hani’s memorial this week, with an additional “socio” thrown in. “We have decided to focus firmly on radical socio-economic transformation in the remaining term of this government,” President Zuma told his audience. In January, the Sunday Times reported that President Zuma demanded the reworking of several economic policy proposals because they were “not radical enough”. Compare that version of President Zuma to the one who shut down the Julius Malema-run ANC Youth League’s proposals for radical economic transformation at the ANC national general council in 2010. That year’s Zuma was all about caution and deferral to international markets, telling the NGC that it should be aware that employment creation “cannot be done easily or overnight”. In 2010 Zuma continued: “Critically, [employment creation] has to be achieved in a way that sustains growth and transforms the quality of that growth so that we ensure that both the benefits and costs of change are fairly spread, in ways that protect the poor and bring about a more equitable and just society.” Economic measures that the President endorsed back then included “appropriate fiscal and monetary policy measures that are actively directed to promoting larger number of jobs. These should be linked with measures to control inflation and improve efficiency across the economy, including through a more competitive and stable exchange rate”. The President’s 2010 utterances on such matters were in line with what had by then become tradition. From 1994 onwards, ANC leadership favoured a more centrist, measured tone when approaching economic transformation. This was the case even during the transition to democracy. Read Codesa documents now, and you may find the language astonishingly tame by today’s standards. “Socio-economic conditions should be improved to curb the high crime rate,” reads one Codesa resolution. The draft principle on economic freedom notes: “The Constitution should provide for the promotion of the improvement in the quality of life of all South Africans by enabling economic growth, human development, social justice and equal opportunities for all.” What changed things? From around 2011, a sense of greater urgency began to be heard in government’s declarations on the economy. Just after local government elections in 2011, ANC alliance partner Numsa, under the leadership of Irvin Jim (pre-Marikana) announced that the alliance would need to “champion a radical programme that seeks to transfer the bulk of the wealth of our country into the hands of the people as a whole”. By the time of the ANC conference in Mangaung in 2012, radical was the order of the day. There, the ruling party resolved that “the second phase in our transition from apartheid colonialism to a national democratic society will be characterised by more radical policies and decisive action to effect thorough-going socio-economic and continued democratic transformation”. Just less than a year later, the Economic Freedom Fighters would officially burst on to the scene, bringing far more revolutionary rhetoric into the public space. Come the launch of the ANC’s election manifesto in 2014, and the word “radical” is being thrown about with considerably more abandon. Despite the build-up over the last five years or so, the renewed emphasis on the “radical” right now has lately caused some scepticism even from within government. In late February, general secretary of the South African Communist Party Blade Nzimande – better known as Minister of Higher Education – told a media briefing disapprovingly: “Policy shifts with a radical sounding air are being announced randomly.” The SACP had its own theory about why this should be the case now in particular. “While the Gupta family clearly lurks in the background in many cases, there has been an attempt to downplay links in this direction and adopt a more radical sounding, Africanist posture,” Nzimande said at the same briefing. The suggestion there was that radical political posturing was aimed at deflecting attention away from Gupta control of the state. An alternative theory would be that the radical rhetoric is also nicely in line with the Gupta family’s war on financial institutions and “white monopoly capital”: in other words, that a call to escalate radical discourse might have come from the Guptas themselves. From the beginning of the year, Gupta-owned media products – TV channel ANN7 and newspaper The New Age – began running a campaign titled “The Fight for Economic Liberation”.  Few people would dispute that the economic transformation of South Africa since apartheid has been unsuccessful thus far, so from that perspective the ANC’s verbal acceleration on the issue now might seem expected; even necessary. The timing, however, will inevitably raise eyebrows. In a time of protest, populist statements on land and the economy may be seen as the best ways to stem dissent. In that context, those who are anti-Zuma can be swiftly framed as anti-radical reform. It remains to be seen if the EFF-led anti-Zuma march on Wednesday can manage to simultaneously express dissatisfaction with the sitting president and affirm its commitment to a radicalism which the ruling party is now claiming for itself.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 134 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares270 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company. I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine CF542 6 months? I replaced my S7E three times in four months for chronic and various problems before giving up and going Pixel blueman24 "Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES." "I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge" "Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months." You brought a $700 S7edge and not a $300 oneplus, so it should not be acceptable for it to become less responsive after 6 months? Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. WARLORD VIII On the up side the Pixel isn't catching on fire 😎 das I thought that was a feature for survivalists. :P Eric Works for me. The most stable software wise of any phone I've ever used. Paid 300 for mine and prefer it over the s7. Curved screens don't like screen protector. Nothing like water resistant on a phone that looks like a cat danced on it. Another huge plus is the lack of carrier spam. I'm not getting all the complaints. Google showed us we'd be getting if we choose to buy it. I for one have no regrets about doing so. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. Kristian Ivanov I'm not going to comment on the actual design, I want to hear thoughts comparing it to the undesputed legend - Nexus 5 (design only) JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. CF542 The only thing that the S7/S8 truly suffer from is having Samsung as a parent. They turned the phone (s) into a piece of bloatware full of crappy software that nobody wants. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Ryan Those are usability preferences. I will agree the settings are a freaking nightmare to find, but I dont go into settings often. Right now, and for over a year now, bluetooth audio has been straight-up broken. They implemented that absoloute volume BS without coding how to handle devices that dont send volume information, breaking it in my car. Then the idiots put developer setting that is to allow you to disable it but they didnt even test it and the user doesnt have permissions to change that setting, so the switch does nothing. That is a BIG bug, and one that Google has refused to address for over a year. Then there is the fact that my phone, and the first Nexus phone I have had to deal with this on, has to be rebooted every few weeks because it slows down horribly. Jack Smith Based on what? Had every iPhone since the 3G and relatively recently added Android as carry both and Android is excellent. So much is written is just simply not true. Suggest actually give recent Android a try and you might be surprised ;). Ryan Ive had android for coming up on 8 years, HTC Hero was the first, then one more HTC before going Nexus. Been on Nexus and still am with my 5x. I know, personally, some of the MAJOR shortcomings of Googles implementation of Android. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. ScratchC The problem with the Internet is how do I know you actually own one? Or are you just a troll. In any case, I unfortunately had to pass on the Pixel my S6 shit the bed and I had just upgraded to the S7. My gf tho.. I somehow convinced her to grab a Pixel on Verizon. She has not had not 1 issue. I'm not saying they don't exist. It's just not as bad as commenters trying to win an argument make it seem. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of the 22 Pixel photos had halos. None of the LG G6 photos had halos. whispy_snippet Wow. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. Vega007 My Pixel is, by far, the best phone I have ever had for battery life. Christopher Bement I'm only going with devices I've actually used, I haven't touched a Pixel personally. All I can say is it's day and night between the N6 and S7 on a given work day where I'm calling, texting and emailing almost constantly. Vega007 That's a good point, it all depends on what phone we have used to compare it to. I have never used a S7 Edge, but I have used a S7. While the battery life was fine, the Pixel does do better for my usage (I'm using the 5" btw). And that's the real key to battery issue is personal use. We all use our devices differently so battery life will always be subjective. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. ScratchC The iPhone has been in trouble for some time. It's why it started playing catch up (Forget current sales up to now. Poll after poll, iPhone users are bored of iPhones) Actually Google's Android is in trouble as well. Samsung is doing their own thing. Google needs to put it's foot down or compete. The Pixel is an attempt to do so. It's not perfect by any means. it's better than nothing and it was a solid first entry. If you simply don't like it.. Buy elsewhere. that's the beauty of Android. I think you guys forget, that out of our fanboy bubble, most people when they think of Android have a distinct definition. I'm talking the average consumer...they think Android = cheap phone from prepaid carrier that's slow, plastic, horrible camera & full of bugs. Or.. Android = Samsung Galaxy. Your average consumer still doesn't know what a Pixel is nvm that they don't even know what a Nexus was. Android phones need to be a premium product to compete. They need to charge the amount of money it takes for proper R&D.. Customer support etc. Google cannot sell at a loss and accomplish this. This very reason is why Samsung holds the Android crown. Regardless of your opinion towards their devices. Remember that Carrier subsidizing is how Galaxy devices sell by the millions. Iphones as well. Google is on the right path. They just need to bring the next Pixel to all carriers. Lindsay Meyer You're right. I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved those iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices), and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick (and their new iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to throw my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability, and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. mrjayviper Fairly new? How long have they been selling Nexus phones and other devices? MJ Let me get this straight... You left a comment without reading the whole discussion? I already very clearly laid out an actual argument but thanks for your input. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. madcanada That's correct, I'm pissed that Pixel gets a better camera software while Nexus is fundamentally the same in the department. I understand your point about camera being a combination of both hardware and software, but unlike, say, Apple, where each iteration is actually better in terms of hardware, and older iPhones still get whatever features they can physically run, Google decided to accentuate the difference by simply denying their last year phone the same updates. Where Apple only denies updates when the old phone can't actually handle them Google is simply abandoning their last year model to justify the price of the Pixel. whispy_snippet Except there's one key difference. Unlike iPhones that release each year, the Nexus 6P is not of the Pixel lineage. The Pixel is the first of its kind. madcanada That makes not a shred of difference in the argument I'm making. I find denying last year phone updates it perfectly capable of running, so you can justify the price of the new phone ethically questionable. I don't care if they rebranded, their decision to not give Nexus the updates it can handle is only guided by the fact that they wanted to charge twice the price for Pixel, and they couldn't have if Nexus got the goodies. whispy_snippet Ethically questionable? No, mate, it's business. Google's ultimate responsibility is maximising profits for shareholders. You're cranky that your 6P can't do what the more expensive a Pixel can do. Now imagine how Pixel owners would feel if they saw cheaper, older phones from the same company doing exactly the same thing as theirs. Again, I sympathise to an extent, but ultimately you get what you pay for. If you want the Pixel experience, buy it. madcanada I'm not cranky because my Nexus 6P can't do things Pixel can, on the contrary, I get full Pixel experience with free unlimited full size photo upload, Pixel launcher, Pixel camera, and day one Google Assistant on Nexus 6P. I'm cranky because I need to go to XDA to get them goodies. I understand it's business, but if you want to sell charge twice for the phone - sell a better phone, give us a better camera, bigger battery life, and don't downgrade our goddamn speakers. whispy_snippet Mate, you're simply not making sense anymore. You're effectively wanting something for nothing. You want Google to give you a Pixel quality camera experience on an older, less expensive phone from an entirely different lineage - for free. You're not entitled to free stuff. I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree. madcanada you can disagree all your want, i outlined my gripe with Google in the first post, then you decided to argue about the camera. New lineage or not, when you market Nexus as the phone that gets all the Google love, and then you just leave users behind right next generation simply to justify the price hike of new Pixel - that's low. Apple's feature fragmentation is driven solely by the hardware - newer phones get new exclusive features because older models can't do the same thing physically. Google is creating artificial fragmentation in order to justify twice the price. That's not the Google I remember and that's not the direction I like. Obviously it's their choice. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? Mix Sounds like you have not done this before because sending your phone to Google first, waiting for them to get it and look it over THEN sending a replacement is, 100%, the bad choice. Having them send you the phone first and put a hold on your creditcard is the better and faster choice! Complaining gets you nothing, USA got free daydream headsets, Canadians got nothing. The phone, after taxes, was $1,320.48 - close enough for me to complain about it at the $1,400 point, lol. John Doe OMG, YOU CAN'T READ? That is what I said Google does but you said you had to wait 7 days for your phone but they send you the phone first then you send yours in so no waiting. Yes I have done this before. With Apple, Google, and other companies...it is standard practice. No, they don't charge you taxes they just put a hold of the price of the phone not your total purchase price. Maybe it is just different in Canada...you should stop buying Google products there *rolls eyes* Lindsay Meyer If your damaged, soon-to-be-returned Pixel phone is broken and unusable, there would indeed be a waiting period to have a working phone in either case, because, being unable to easily switch your device at a physical brick and mortar store, you would be at the mercy of waiting for for Google's mailed replacement to have a working phone again. John Doe Google sens it next day here in the US Mix You straight up told me that I chose the bad option: "Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault." when I did not choose the bad option. If my phone bricked, which it did, and it takes 7 days for Googles phone to get to me I have no phone for 7 days, that is waiting without a phone! I think we are both right, 12 of this and a dozen of that, lol. <3 Stuff in Canada is more expensive and shipping generally sucks. I normally chose 2 day shipping with Amazon and get refunded shipping costs because the shipping companies miss the delivery date constantly. Nexus 4 and 5 have been sweet, my Pixel experience has been garbage. Their customer service has been good though so yay for that. Lindsay Meyer Canadian $ ≠ US $ John Doe Yeah but the phone still does not cost $1,400 in canada so yeah destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I'd far rather spend 5-10 minutes online from home getting my replacement shipped to me for free than having to go into a store, talk to someone who's less knowledgeable about my phone than I am, convince them to get it replaced, and then pay them an additional $35 to have them facilitate my phone then getting shipped to their store where I have to return to pick it up. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. Aaron Yeah, top notch. Tell that to all those iPhone 6plus users with the death screen disease and Apple does nothing... mrjayviper Out of warranty? I don't think Google supports out of warranty devices to donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. Berni Hargrove Hold on now, Chromebooks are more than good enough if you go price for price on a cheap laptop. There's no way that $200 Windows laptop with 2gigs of ram is performing on the same level as a $200 Chromebook with the same specs. In addition the reason why "Good Enough" applies to this is because the average person wants to pay very little for a computer, but have it be "fast and last a long time" to effectively browse and use Office. Anyone here should know, unless you are getting over on someone, the least you should pay for decent laptop is $500, but the amount of times I've had people in Best Buy whine that that's too expensive for them to just be using Office and small tasks is frequent. Google can make good products that are ready for primetime when they don't have their ass or in the clouds, but sadly as their messaging strategy has showed us, that's increasingly uncommon. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal. Roy https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fef4fa148cb6b5c2f15fcd856ec70e90ed88abb6606e0f6554b4d09654040535.png Max Johnson X-tra Bezel. Eric Marciniak Doesn't help that Best Buy has a giant iPhone 7 ad that literally blocks the pixel display from view right when you walk in haha. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8283702e9d03a34df4cfb2bd525ea593d0304d3937690392b7b3acc57eb7620e.jpg Berni Hargrove Best Buy is terrible with product placement. Shit literally changes every season if not more. Good luck finding anything remotely niche on your own. lol Jon E. Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. Berni Hargrove While I agree with a lot of what you said, some of your logic is flawed. Take america for example. There's over 150 million people here. It would take at least 15 million in sales here alone, just to see 1 in 10 people with it. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers. C Lo Good first article Trevor. Welcome aboard. Suyash Bansal I liked the article. 🙃 Orjuan Google Pixels customer service is great if you ask me. It takes like a week to get a replacement, not a month. Also, comparing it to the One Plus 3T is unfair, you didn't mention the superior processing and graphical power and the fact that it gets updates for the next 5-8 years. It also features Google Assistant, which is a big selling point. Add all those up and pixel is worth the extra 400. Plus, I got a regular pixel, with a two year protection plan, 128 GB, and it's still cheaper than iPhone. Google Pixel is a commercial and consumer success. Do your research before spouting out shit, all you did was look at the obvious facts and ignored the small stuff that counts. "UGHHHHH, it has a better camera and that's it.". RESEARCH YOUR TOPICS, Google Pixel is $400 more than One Plus 3T because it's better! Orjuan Plus, Nexus was barely Google at all, they just supplied the best version of Android while hiring an OEM to make the parts and design, while slapping their logo on it. Nexus was good, but not Google's essence, it was a startup for Pixel, which is 100% Google. AJZ16 couldn't care less* usamaisawake I had an entire column of pixels that were not working properly. Thing is my Pixel arrived in the first shipment and I had to leave the country so I didn't umbox it until 4 weeks later. When I called to let them know, they were curious why I waited so long and I explained I hadn't turned it on till just then. They didn't give me any trouble with it and exchanged it right away. They sent the new phone and then after I received it I shipped the old back to them. Perhaps this was still early in the release of the phone so they felt more obligated to make sure the experience was good. Phil Rowley My pixel bricked. I thought Google's customer service (along with bestbuy even though I paid for their stupid geek squad) were horrible. I hate to say it but Verizon was the most helpful and luckily I pay for their monthly insurance. Colin Richardson I miss the Nexus line.. Thankfully I can still buy some Nexus 5X phones (not refurbished). But that will not last. I have no idea what I will do for a phone after that.. I want a Stock Android phone, not a Stock Android Flagship phone. Max Johnson There are plenty of stock-like flagship and non-flagship Android phones. HTC, Sony, Moto and OnePlus are all stock based at varying prices. If you want direct update from Google and good customer service that's a different story, I think that's the main thing now, to get the same quality of support as Apple on Android. I'm surprised to get frequently updates from Sony with latest monthly security patches on my X Compact. Micah T "couldn't* care less." Think about it.... Tr3ple I bought a Pixel XL for 370 and I threw my Galaxy S7 edge in the drawer LMAO 😂 oh Happy day. Sammy Phillips 370 USD? or 370 Euro? Tr3ple USD, bought it 220 with a broken screen and fixed it for 150. So I spent 370. mtz Interesting article however, in the same way Microsoft is not really trying to sell the overpriced Surface Studio , Google is not trying to sell Pixels. Why? Simple. Goole has OEM partners that have supported the Android platform by providing the hardware from the beginning. While it one thing for Google to partner with a carrier each year and release a basic Nexus phone its an entirely different thing for them to release top tier Device and undercut thoes partners on price. Tony Bundy Replied via non-existent really blue Pixel. Yes, wasn't easy but here I am. 😀 Pixel.ization.alism Well precisely Google Blue would be #4285F4 not #4485ED if you would ask. Zuxs13 This was a rather poor opinion piece. You make claims like you can't "easily get a replacement pixel" which is completely untrue. The Apple store is hardly the only place that sells phones and offers good customer service. The OP3T might be readily available, but most consumers have no clue what it is or where to even buy one and would rather buy a phone that is sold at their service provider or local best buy and is supported by 24/hr support service. das "Couldn't care less" - if one *could* care less, than it currently cares. Lindsay Meyer I mentioned this in another thread but feel it probably merits its own post here, coming from the perspective of a disenchanted iPhone user who now owns a Pixel (and is still disenchanted). I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved the iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices) and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick, or worse, new packaging on the same lipstick (and their upgraded iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to hurl my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's kind of a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have more innovative features, but Apple with come right behind it and perfect those features. That's what they do now. Still glad I didn't get the iPhone 7; Apple didn't deserve my business, but Pixel has been a disappointment to me thus far. For the price, I'd prefer my husband's Nexus 6. I think he'd prefer his old HTC if it had front-facing speakers lol. I just don't feel there's a lot of good options out there right now that justify the cost. I have given serious thought to trying to find a replacement comparable to the old Sanyo 6100 (yes, that one) and then throwing an iPad or a tablet in my purse. Maybe even that old B&O phone would be fun. I'm just tired of my need for a smartphone to be continually exploited by these inferior products; half the time they break right after the warranty expires, and like an endentured servant, I'm forced into the process all over again. Also, the fact that this Pixel wants to track everything I do scares the bejeezus out of me. I'm sure Apple has done the same thing more covertly for years, but seeing everything I say, type, search, view, read.. not to mention every place I eat at, travel to or shop.. neatly organized into a little packaged profile makes me feel like a product more than ever. Eliminating Google's permissions to track this info also eliminates much of the Pixel's functionality as a smart phone with fluid communication between apps. I should have probably mentioned this first because I absolutely hate that aspect of it. Renee Looker I don't know about anyone else's opinion on the Pixel phone but I have the Pixel XL Blue and have had it since release. I've not had any issues with my phone, absolutely love it. Really quite eager to see what Google will be releasing next, the rumors are on the rise on what's up next. Nicholas Conrad Great article! techieland You and we are the customers when it come to the Pixel and Pixel Xl. And even the late and great Nexus products to some extent. Personally I think the Pixel phones were a fail, Google should have stuck to making reference level phones to ensure the manufacturers understand what the minimum an Android phone is supposed to be like. Samsung and OnePlus obviously gets it but it seems LG, HTC, & Motorola, are struggling despite all 3 being manufacturers of Nexus/AOSP devices. sgtguthrie *couldn't care less Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 142k 105k Latest Deals 2 [Deal Alert] Order an Amazon gift card valued at $25 or more through Alexa and get a $5 promo credit 2017/04/11 3:50pm PDTApr 11, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Verizon BlackBerry Priv for $259.99 on eBay 2017/04/11 12:35pm PDTApr 11, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Amazon's Gold Box deal has a SanDisk MicroSD 256GB for $120 and a 128GB dual USB-C/A drive for $39 2017/04/11 4:46am PDTApr 11, 2017 35 [Update: Added some more] Deal Alert: Here are some more temporarily free apps and games for your Sunday 2017/04/09 3:05pm PDTApr 9, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Gen LTE for $179.99 ($220 off) on eBay 2017/04/08 7:15pm PDTApr 8, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Following the algorithmic advertising debacle that reared its head a couple of weeks ago, where Google was inserting ads from well known companies into YouTube clips from terrorist organisations, they've been caught up in a salary equity brouhaha. But the company has hit back, claiming they don't have an equity and equality problem. It all started when the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs at the U.S. Department of Labor (OFCCP) accused Google of not compensating women fairly. Silicon Valley has not enjoyed a great reputation when it comes to equity, with allegations of misogyny and harassment. But Google says, in a recent blog post, that it conducts annual reviews to ensure their pay structures and other employment benefits are distributed fails. Google says it will work with the OFCCP to clear the matter up. But I'm curious. Do your employers have processes in place to regularly review work conditions to ensure there is gender equity and equal opportunity? If they do, what processes do they have?

Bam, instant 20% profit to the bottom line! The pay gap is due to failures in personal negotiation. Females typically bend to corporate will easier (I'm not a bitch!). Males typically look after themselves (I'm strong!). You have a personal responsibility to your family herd - not the herd of the corporation. Understand how to negotiate.

Prices for iTunes Match and Google Play Music have gone up in Russia as foreign online companies operating here now have to pay "the Google tax" – the value added tax (VAT), which they were previously exempt from. Apple has raised the price of an annual subscription for iTunes Match by 16%. Monthly subscription fees for Apple Music have remained unchanged for now. Google has informed users that due to the changes in the Russian legislation, the value added that an 18 percent VAT will now be added to the price of all subscriptions, including that of Google Play Music. "Google observes the tax legislation in all countries where it operates," a spokesperson for Google in Russia told Billboard. Apple's Russian office did not respond to Billboard's request for comment. The VAT for foreign online companies operating in Russia was introduced last year, effective Jan. 1, 2017. It is to be paid on a quarterly basis and this month, companies will have to pay it for the first time for the period between Jan.–March. In addition to Google and Apple, the tax will also apply to Netflix, Microsoft and Facebook. In 2008, an exemption from VAT was adopted in Russia for foreign software developers. It was subsequently applied to software sales on Apple's AppStore and Google Play and later to sales of music and films on iTunes, Google Play Music and Netflix. In early 2016, however, local online video services and music streaming companies complained that the exemption of their foreign competitors from paying VAT led to "unequal market conditions.” The Russian legislators immediately jumped on the idea of introducing VAT for foreign online companies, which was dubbed "the Google tax." The government estimates it will take in an extra 10 billion rubles ($174 million) a year from the added tax.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Google, an Internet search provider, said it conducts "rigorous analyses" that its pay practices are gender-blind and found "no gender pay gap" in 52 major job categories it analyzed last year. Google added that analysts who calculate suggested pay don't have access to employees' gender data. Google also said that beyond gender pay equity, the company recently expanded the analysis to cover race in the U.S. as well. The U.S. Department of Labor had accused Google of shortchanging women doing similar work to men, saying it found "systemic compensation disparities" across the company's workforce. Google responded in a blog post Tuesday that the department's assertion "came without any supporting data or methodology." The company said it had already produced hundreds of thousands of documents in response to 18 separate requests, and the government is seeking thousands more, including contact details of employees. The department had no comment, saying the case is ongoing. The difference between Google's and the Labor Department's claims might come down to how each side defines pay discrimination, Tim Worstall, a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute in London, wrote in a recent post for Forbes. "Google is using a strict definition of 'same job' to find no gender pay gap. The Department of Labor is using a looser definition of 'similar job' to find that there is one," he wrote. "Who you think is right here is entirely up to you but that's where the disagreement is." © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Google's Wifi (that's how Google spells the name) mesh-router kit is an easy, fast and, at $300 for a three-pack, relatively inexpensive way to cover a home with wireless data. But you'll definitely need more than one unit to work effectively, as individual Google Wifi units have shorter ranges than those of any other mesh-router system we've tested. You'll also need a phone or tablet, and a Google account, to set them up. We can recommend Google Wifi over the Eero and Luma systems, which are similar to Google Wifi but more expensive. But if cost were no objection, we'd spend the extra $100 and go for the much more powerful Netgear Orbi. Each Google Wifi unit is small and can be hidden on a shelf or a window sill. Design With a diameter of 4.1 inches and a height of 2.7 inches, each Google Wifi unit is small and can be hidden on a shelf or a window sill. They're tiny compared with the Netgear Orbi's 8.9-inch-tall base station, and are more on a par with Ubiquiti Network's AmpliFi HD's 3.9-inch cube router. Like the AmpliFi HD, each Google Wifi unit has an LED ring to show its status. The LED can be dimmed or turned off. It glows bluish-white when things are OK, but changes to amber if your internet connection is severed. Google Wifi, however, lacks the AmpliFi HD's 1.6-inch touch screen or the ability to act as a clock or a visual network monitor. You can buy Google Wifi units for $129 each, or a set of three for $299. That's inexpensive compared with other mesh-router systems such as the AmpliFi, Eero or Luma, which cost $350 and $400 for a three-pack, respectively, or the even pricier Linksys Velop and Orbi, which cost $350 or $400, respectively, for two powerful units. Built around 2x2 MIMO technology (which means it can handle two streams of simultaneous data connections with one similarly equipped laptop), the Google Wifi system has a theoretical maximum performance of 1.2Gbps. There's an array of five antennas (four Wi-Fi and one Bluetooth) arranged around each device's circumference. Each Google Wifi node is rated to cover 1,500 square feet, more than enough for most apartments and small houses. Three Google Wifi devices can, in theory,  cover a 4,500-square-foot home. You can connect up to four satellites, making up to five broadcast points in total, to cover extra real estate. On the underside of each Google Wifi unit is a USB-C power port, along with a pair of Gigabit Ethernet ports for linking the router to the home's broadband modem as well as to a networked data-storage unit, printer or LAN switch (if you need to connect more Ethernet devices). Google Wifi doesn't require any knowledge of networking, the internet or of computer technology. You will need a Google account, however. On units acting as extenders rather than routers, both Ethernet ports can connect to local devices (or directly to the router unit, if you have enough cable to hardwire the nodes). If you have a combination modem/router, you'll need to disable its router functions to use Google Wifi. However, there's no USB 2.0 port to hook up a Google Wifi unit to a local printer or storage drive. If you use such a device, you'll have to trade up to a networked one. (To be fair, most of the mesh-router systems that come with USB ports haven't turned them on.) Because each Google Wifi unit is physically identical, any one of them can be set up as the router in a mesh-router configuration. Google Wifi is also backward-compatible with Google's earlier router, the OnHub, so one or more Wifi units can be added as a node to extend an OnHub's range. MORE: Best Routers Specs Wi-Fi Spec: 802.11ac/Dual Band Mesh Number of Antennas/Removable: 4/No Ports: Two 1Gbps LAN, USB-C (power) Processor: ARM quad-core 710MHz Memory/Storage: 512MB/4GB WiFi Chip: Qualcomm IPQ4019 Peak 802.11ac Performance: 464.4Mbps Range: 105 feet - router only Size: 4.1- x 4.1- x 2.7 inches Performance With the ability to handle only two lanes of data traffic, Google Wifi is a step behind the Ubiquiti AmpliFi HD, Linksys Velop and Netgear Orbi's three concurrent data streams, and our test results bore that out. Like the roughly similar Eero mesh-router system, the Wifi lacks the latest MU-MIMO technology for satisfying several clients at once. Each Google Wifi unit is powered by a 710 MHz ARM-based quad-core processor, and has 512MB of RAM and 4GB of solid-state storage space. It uses Qualcomm's IPQ4019 Wi-Fi radio and control chip. Google says the internal network created among three or more nodes is a true mesh network, in that each node is equal and you can send signals between satellite nodes without going through the router node. In our own testing, we were not able to confirm or disprove this, but whereas some mesh systems' signals jumped all over the place, the Wifi was stable and consistent. Using IxChariot software, Purch Labs' real-world testing showed that a single Google Wifi device could deliver a combined throughput of 464.4  megabits per second at 5 feet, which drops to 440.1 Mbps (at 15 feet), 389.7 Mbps (50 feet) and 227.2Mbps (100 feet). Compared with other single mesh-router units, those numbers are respectable but not spectacular. Router Performance Compared (in Mbps)*   AmpliFi HD Eero Google Wifi Linksys Velop Netgear Orbi 5 feet 368.17 573.65 464.36 412.34 552.11 15 feet 377.73 +2.6% 450.96 -21.4% 440.90 -5.1% 527.10 +30% 510.90 -7.5% 50 feet 350.83 -4.7% 449.87 -21.6% 389.74 -16% 459.35 +11% 447.13 -19% 100 feet 293.82 -20% 250.27 -56.4% 227.22 -51% 330.06 -20% 371.42 -33% 150 feet 230.86 -37% 229.85 -59.9% 33.79 -93% 288.42 -30% 229.07 -58% * Line-of-sight testing with a single router point. Percentages indicate change from 5-foot measurement on same device. However, at 150 feet, a single Google Wifi device could deliver only 33.8 Mbps, a 93 percent decrease from the 5-foot rate. No other mesh system we've tested showed such a steep drop-off past 100 feet. [dropoff chart] By comparison, the Amplifi HD, Eero, Orbi and Velop were all pushing between 229 and 288 Mbps at 150 feet – more than the Google Wifi could manage at 100 feet. Again, if you get Google Wifi, you'll need to get more than one. The Google Wifi's signal showed little deterioration when penetrating walls with metal shelving, thick soundboard and ceilings, although the Eero showed even less. In the Purch Labs’ single-hop and double-hop tests involving extra nodes placed every 50 feet, the Wifi beat the Eero, but perhaps only because the Eero's stronger overall signal strength caused more interference between nodes. Data Penetration Compared (in Mbps)*   AmpliFi HD Eero Google Wifi Linksys Velop Netgear Orbi Metal 343.45 -9.1% 448.58 -0.5% 396.39 -10% 559.95 +6.2% 455.70 -11% Soundboard 369.51 -2.2% 457.17 +1.4% 402.55 -8.7% 381.66 -28% 549.99 +7.7% Ceiling 390.21 +3.3% 471.79 +4.6% 425.2 -3.6% 67.80 -87% 424.12 -17% *Throughput from a single router point passing through ceiling and walls of different compositions. Percentages indicate change from 15-foot line-of-sight measurement. The Wifi perked up when its units were placed in complicated configurations scattered among multiple rooms on two floors. With the router set up 30 feet and one wall away from a satellite node, and the Purch Labs test laptop located one floor up, directly above the satellite, we read 189.9 Mbps, a more than fourfold boost above the throughput without the intervening node. That's a lot more than the Eero. Single-Line Extension Hop Test (in Mbps)*   AmpliFi HD Eero Google Wifi Linksys Velop Netgear Orbi Single Hop (100 feet) 219.93 -25% 128.99 -48.5% 175.57 -23% 331.62 +0.5% 475.87 +28% Double Hop (150 feet) n/a 103.52 -55.0% 128.90 +282% 223.22 -23% n/a *Extensions placed every 50 feet between router and endpoint. Percentages indicate change from line-of-sight tests at same distances without extensions. However, the Velop and Orbi blew the Wifi (and the Eero) out of the water in these 3D tests, Those systems have much stronger signals, MU-MIMO capabilities and a third band, inaccessible to client devices, to handle the communications between nodes. They're in a different league. 3D Extension Hop Tests (in Mbps)*   AmpliFi HD Eero Google Wifi Linksys Velop Netgear Orbi 30 feet thru 2 walls (A to B) 393.32 445.33 251.09 371.03 333.64 33 feet thru wall, ceiling (A to C) 192.47 136.46 36.75 121.81 119.99 48 feet thru 2 walls, ceiling (A to D) 99.72 10.62 4.42 40.29 47.35 One hop, 45 feet thru ceiling, 2 walls (A to B to C) 202.08 +5.0% 117.63 -13.8% 189.92 +417% 427.00 +250 429.13 +258% One hop, 68 feet thru ceiling, 4 walls (A to B to D) 158.01 +58% 99.81 +839.8% 73.23 +1,557% 332.79 +726% 245.66 +419% Two hops, 80 feet thru ceiling, 4 walls (A to B to C to D) n/a 30.71 +189.2% 56.63 +1,181% 145.41 +261% n/a *First three tests involve direct router-to-client communication, with client laptop moving to new rooms and floors. Second three tests add extensions to same configurations. Percentages indicate change in data throughput between two sets. In an old suburban home with lots of thick walls, a single Google Wifi unit, acting as a router, had a range that reached as far as 105 feet. By comparison, the Eero reached only 65 feet, The Google Wifi network easily covered the 3,500-square-foot, three-story home in two different configurations, with range to spare. We first set up one node acting as a router in the middle of the home's main floor, with the two other nodes acting as extensions in the basement and second floor, directly above and below the router. Then we put the router node in the basement and the extensions on the main and second floors. Either way, the network delivered between 60- and 95 Mbps of download speed out of a potential 100 Mbps as measured by Speedtest.net. Google Wifi also survived our informal saturation test, in which we played videos on an iPad Pro and a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 tablet while a MacBook Air played an internet radio station and a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro S swapped data with a LAN storage system. The audio came through loud and clear, while the video was smooth without dropped frames or skips. Setup, Warranty and Support In a world where every new mesh-router kit tries to simplify the setup process further, Google Wifi nearly takes the lead. It doesn't require any knowledge of networking, the internet or of computer technology. You will need a Google account, however. After plugging the Google Wifi device I planned to use as the router into an electrical outlet and my broadband modem, I loaded and opened the Google Wifi app on my iPad Pro tablet. There are apps for iOS 8 and later and Android 4 and later, but as with most mesh-router systems (except the Orbi), there's no way to configure the devices from a PC, Mac or online interface. You'll need to type in the code printed underneath the Google Wifi device, or capture its QR code. The interface quickly creates a Bluetooth connection with your phone or tablet. After you sign in using a Google account, the app finds the device and asks you to select the device's location or type one in. Finally, you need to come up with a network name and a passcode. That's it. The network started doling out data after a quick restart. Adding the mesh extensions took 5 minutes each. At the end, the software presented me with a summary of the settings and performed a network test. All told, it took 15 minutes to fill my house with data. The Google Wifi mesh kit includes a one-year warranty and a slew of online resources that range from videos and tips to mesh tutorials. There's a 24/7 hotline if you need to talk to a technician, and you can also email them questions. On the downside, there's no manual with detailed instructions. MORE: How a VPN Can Boost Your Security and Privacy Customization and Smart Home As is the case with the Luma and AmpliFi HD apps, the Google Wifi app's setup screens run in portrait mode. The main screen monitors the network, shows that your extensions are connected and lets you adjust a guest network's settings. At any time, you can run a network check. The Settings section has a way to prioritize which systems get first dibs on data, and can also control home automation devices such as the Philips Hue bridge and connected lights directly, and smart thermostats and smart locks through IFTTT. However, there's no way to interact with a voice assistant, whereas most mesh-router systems can accept basic Amazon Alexa commends. And although Google shares a parent company with Nest Labs, IFTTT is for the moment the only way Google Wifi can interact with the Nest Cam, Protect and Smart Thermostat. The Google Wifi app lets you manage port forwarding and set your favorite DNS server. The Network Settings are rudimentary, however, compared with those of some traditional routers, having only the abilities to restart the router, do a factory reset and add another extension. Google Wifi supports static IP addressing, and you can also reserve IP addresses for key LAN accessories. It also lacks controls that are standard on high-performance traditional routers, such as the ability to adjust the transmission strength and change the channel width. While Google Wifi doesn't currently work with IP version 6 addressing, Google is working on an update to add that function. MORE: The Best Smart Home Devices That Work with Google Home Security and Parental Controls Like most recent mesh-router systems, Google Wifi supports WPA2 wireless encryption. It won't work with older and less secure WEP-based devices, though. If you have any Wi-Fi-enabled devices built before 2002, you might have to connect them to the router via Ethernet. Each Google Wifi unit has an Infineon Trusted Platform Module (TPM) built in, which can thwart hackers by creating an encrypted link with Google's servers for downloads and verifying the installed firmware upon reboot. Google Wifi automatically updates its firmware as needed, something that many mesh routers, and more regular routers are beginning to do. Unlike some other modern home wireless routers, Google Wifi lacks parental controls. You can "pause" the internet connection to specific or all devices for dinner or a family meeting, but that's about it. You can't cut off excursions into the dark side of the online world by blacklisting websites or categories. Nor can you limit individual users' hours of online use. The Google Wifi also doesn't screen out known malicious websites, which the current Bitdefender Box and upcoming Norton Core and F-Secure Sense security routers do. Bottom Line It may not be the most powerful mesh-router kit around, but Google Wifi's $300 three-pack is one of the cheapest and easiest ways to fill a large home with strong wireless connections. Because it lacks parental controls, a detailed settings menu or a desktop administrative interface, the Google Wifi may not for everyone — but it is for those who want to set up a mesh-router system without thinking about it too much, or without busting their budgets. Credit: Google 8/10 Quick Take Google Wifi is stable, secure, easy to set up and relatively inexpensive. But it's got less power or range than other mesh systems. If you can afford it, we recommend the Netgear Orbi instead. - About the author Brian Nadel @nadelbrian Brian Nadel is a freelance writer and editor who specializes in technology reporting and reviewing.

In a blog post on Tuesday, the company said its own reviews found that there is not any gender inequality in how it pays its workers. And Google insisted it has a system in place to correct any potential gender pay discrepancies. ADVERTISEMENT “It’s very important to us that men and women who join Google in the same role are compensated on a level playing field, when they start and throughout their careers here,” wrote Eileen Naughton, Google’s vice president of “people operations,” the company's human resources equivalent. “Our analysis gives us confidence that there is no gender pay gap at Google.” Naughton said that Google was “taken aback” by the charge from the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs that the company did not pay women fairly. The agency said an ongoing investigation showed Google could be violating federal laws over its pay of women. “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, said in a San Francisco court on Friday. The charge came out in a court hearing over a lawsuit that the department filed against Google in January for access to its payment data. Google responded to the Labor Department’s allegation in a statement to the Guardian on Friday, writing that “the [Department of Labor] hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology.” Google previously came under scrutiny for its gender pay practices in 2015, when then-employee Erica Baker created a spreadsheet that employees at the company could voluntarily put their salaries in. She said the data “highlighted not great things.” The department’s dispute with Google is part of a broader set of suits against Silicon Valley companies over alleged discrimination. In January, the agency sued Oracle for pay discrimination against women, as well as African-Americans and Asians. In September, the agency sued Palantir for allegedly discriminating against Asian job applicants.   View the discussion thread.

Called AutoDraw, the software is another of Google’s ongoing creative machine learning demonstrations that it releases as part of its AI Experiments series. It uses the underlying technology behind the company’s experimental image recognition software to identify potential objects and pairs that with a database of neat and simplistic hand-drawn images. A doodle bot for fast and clean clip art The company bills AutoDraw as a “drawing tool for the rest of us,” and by us it means aesthetically impaired individuals who couldn’t doodle themselves out of a paper bag. “AutoDraw pairs the magic of machine learning with drawings from talented artists to help you draw stuff fast,” says the narrator in Google’s AutoDraw teaser video. The actual tech under the hood comes from another Google AI experiment called Quick Draw, which uses machine learning to analyze human drawings and get better over time at guessing what they are. Quick Draw was a neat distraction, but AutoDraw is an absolute blast with some very tangible benefits for non-artists looking to add art to everything from fliers and party invites to custom birthday cards. For instance, if you want to make some balloons and a cake, it takes just a few moments: Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge Of course, AutoDraw isn’t perfect. A lot of the times the program will suggest some truly bizarre replacements and it’s impossible to know really how the software arrived there. Write some English text, like the word “Verge,” and it will for some reason suggest toes or feet or yoga poses. But that does at the very least give you an opportunity to get really weird and experimental, like turning a taco into a boomerang: Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge Or turning a shooting star into a battle ax: In other cases, AutoDraw feels truly novel and clever, like when it appears to understand doodling shorthand for turning a pair of triangles into a fish: Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge It’s a ton of fun to play with and it’s easily the first of these Google-made experiments I could see truly taking off with the general public. Google seems to know this, too, which is why it made the tool free and accessible through the mobile web, so you can access it on both your desktop and on a tablet or smartphone. Try it out for yourself. Just be warned, it can ensnare even the most casual of doodlers among us into long, procrastinatory art sessions.

Sample fingerpints Handout via The New York Times This image shows sample fingerprints that researchers at New York University and Michigan State University compared against the so-called MasterPrints. Solid black lines around a print indicate a match. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Vindu Goel SAN FRANCISCO — Fingerprint sensors have turned modern smartphones into miracles of convenience. A touch of a finger unlocks the phone — no password required. With services such as Apple Pay or Android Pay, a fingerprint can buy a bag of groceries, a new laptop or even a $1-million vintage Aston Martin. And pressing a finger inside a banking app allows the user to pay bills or transfer thousands of dollars. While such wizardry is convenient, it has also left a gaping security hole. New findings published this week by researchers at New York University and Michigan State University suggest that smartphones can easily be fooled by fake fingerprints digitally composed of many common features found in human prints. In computer simulations, the researchers from the universities were able to develop a set of artificial "MasterPrints" that could match real prints similar to those used by phones as much as 65 per cent of the time. The researchers did not test their approach with real phones, and other security experts said the match rate would be significantly lower in real-life conditions. Still, the findings raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of fingerprint security on smartphones. "It's almost certainly not as worrisome as presented, but it's almost certainly pretty darn bad," said Andy Adler, a professor of systems and computer engineering at Carleton University in Ottawa, who studies biometric security systems. "If all I want to do is take your phone and use your Apple Pay to buy stuff, if I can get into one in 10 phones, that's not bad odds." Full human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but the finger scanners on phones are so small that they read only partial fingerprints. When a user sets up fingerprint security on an Apple iPhone or a phone that runs Google's Android software, the phone typically takes eight to 10 images of a finger to make it easier to make a match. And many users record more than one finger — say, the thumb and forefinger of each hand. Since a finger swipe has to match only one stored image to unlock the phone, the system is vulnerable to false matches. "It's as if you have 30 passwords and the attacker only has to match one," said Nasir Memon, a professor of computer science and engineering at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering, who is one of three authors of the study, which was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security. Memon said their findings indicated that, if you could somehow create a magic glove with a MasterPrint on each finger, you could get into 40 to 50 per cent of iPhones within the five tries allowed before the phone demands the numeric password, known as a personal identification number. Apple said the chance of a false match in the iPhone's fingerprint system was 1 in 50,000 with one fingerprint enrolled. Ryan James, a company spokesperson, said Apple had tested various attacks when developing its Touch ID system, and also incorporated other security features to prevent false matches. Google declined to comment. The actual risk is difficult to quantify. Apple and Google keep many details of their fingerprint technology secret, and the dozens of companies that make Android phones can adapt Google's standard design in ways that reduce the level of security. Stephanie Schuckers, a professor at Clarkson University and director of the Center for Identification Technology Research, was cautious about the implications of the MasterPrint findings. She said the researchers used a mid-range, commercially available software program that was designed to match full fingerprints, limiting the broader applicability of their findings. "To really know what the impact would be on a cellphone, you'd have to try it on the cellphone," she said. She noted that cellphone makers and others who use fingerprint security systems are studying anti-spoofing techniques to detect the presence of a real finger, such as looking for perspiration or examining patterns in deeper layers of skin. A new fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm, for example, uses ultrasound. Phone makers also said that the ease of touching a finger to unlock a phone meant more users actually turned on security features instead of leaving their phones unlocked — a common habit in the early days of smartphones. Ross acknowledged the limitations of the work. "Most of the current smartphone vendors do not give us access to the fingerprint image," he said. Still, the team's fundamental finding that partial fingerprints are vulnerable to spoofing is significant, said Chris Boehnen, the manager of the federal government's Odin program, which studies how to defeat biometric security attacks as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. "What's concerning here is that you could find a random phone, and your barrier to attack is pretty low," Boehnen said. Phone makers could easily increase security by making it harder to match the partial fingerprint, he said, "but the average phone company is more worried about you being annoyed that you have to put your finger against the phone two or three times than they are with someone breaking into it." Adding a larger fingerprint sensor would also decrease the risk, Boehnen said. And some newer biometric security options, such as the iris scanner in Samsung's new Galaxy S8, are harder to fool. Memon said that, despite his research, he was still using fingerprint security on his iPhone. "I'm not worried," he said. "I think it's still a very convenient way of unlocking a phone. But I'd rather see Apple make me enter the PIN if it's idle for one hour."

KOLKATA: Google on Tuesday displayed a painting by Jamini Roy on its homepage to celebrate the legendary painter's 130th birthday. Roy was born on April 11, 1887, according to the English calendar but his descendants celebrate his birth anniversary on Poila Boishakh. The family, however, didn't mind the early celebrations online. "I'm really happy with Google's tribute using a painting of a horse done by Dadu. I've seen at least 10-12 different horses done by him," said Debabrata Roy, the 76-year-old grandson of the artist who has directed a documentary titled 'The Art of Jamini Roy'. However, Roy was certain that the painter would have reacted very differently to Google's homage. "I can visualise him getting very angry with such adulation. He would have turned violent. He just didn't like any gadgets. Before his death, I had tried to get his consent for shooting a film on him. But, there was complete non-cooperation from his side," he recounted. Contrary to artists who are in search of immortality through art, the painter didn't believe in the permanence of art. "He didn't even leave behind a will and was least bothered about how posterity would remember him. All he would say is: 'I don't agree. That's why I paint'," Roy said. Though both the central and state governments have acquired most of the master's works from the family, Roy's collection still has some of his rudimentary sketches. However, he isn't expecting government support to preserve the master's works. "That's not the government's job. If a private organisation is ready to come up with a permanent space where Dadu's works can be on display, I will love to give them there," he said. Describing his grandfather as a 'no-nonsense gentleman', Roy spoke about how the Padma Bhushan winner was "afraid" that his grandson, too, would take to painting. "We can't even imagine his financial struggles. He had to struggle hard to earn one paisa that was needed to buy puffed rice to feed his children. He didn't have money to buy good quality paints. That's why restorers of his early works have such a tough time now. He even used my grandmother's sari as a canvas," Roy added. Yet, the artist didn't increase the price of his works because he believed in reaching out to the masses. "I don't agree with the government's policy that declares his works as 'national treasures'. Artists have no nationalities. Can Van Gogh or Picasso be limited as a national treasure of one country? Sadly, it's impossible to export or take Dadu's works outside India. I think, this policy deprives owners of his works from taking them along if they want to shift out of India. However, I do hear that many of his works are now going under the hammer at international art auctions."

This includes everything from smartphones, tablets and accessories, to connected devices and even video games. Every deal you see below has been hand-picked based on a variety of factors including personal experience, online reviews from customers and experts, and discount percentage. So what are you waiting for? Get shopping! Bose SoundTrue Headphones II Bose Sound True headphones feature exclusive TriPort technology so your music sounds deep, clear and full of life. Plus, they don’t just sound good, they look and feel good, too. The headphones have a softly padded headband that distributes weight evenly across your head, and memory foam creates a gentle cushion around your ears.  The inline microphone and remote let you switch easily to calls on your iPhone, and you get a free carrying case. Buy for $100 (normal price $180). iQunix Spider Aluminum iMac Stand Looking for a stand to raise up an iMac or monitor on your desk? Check out the Spider from iQunix. This super sturdy aluminum stand raises your monitor off of your desk, bringing it to eye level and providing a small space for storage. The stand measures 19.7 x 8.7 x 2 inches, meaning you could put your keyboard under it, or other accessories like your mouse and some sort of power source. Rubber feet prevent the monitor from scratching your desk, and chamfers allow you to thread cables for a cleaner look. Buy for $42.50 using promo code iqunixsp (normal price $60). Coleman 6-Person Instant Cabin Tent I know, I know. We don’t usually mention items like camping equipment on our Daily Deals roundup. But with summer rapidly approaching, and having owned this tent myself, I felt this deal was worth a quick mention. This tent measures 10 x 9 ft., with a 6 ft. center, and it comfortably sleeps 6 people. My favorite part, however, is that this thing goes up in roughly 1 minute. Just unroll it, straighten out the poles and hammer the spikes into the ground. And you can take it down almost as quickly. Buy for $100 (normal price $170). Philips Hue Lighting Kit and Google Home This bundle contains a Hue White & Color Ambiance (A19) Starter Kit and a Google Home speaker. This is a third-generation Hue Kit, meaning it’s HomeKit compatible, and it includes a bridge and 3 LED bulbs—everything you need to get started with smart lighting. Then of course you get a Google Home speaker that is powered by Google’s digital assistant. The speaker allows you to ask it a wide range of questions, listen to endless content, and yes, control your smart home. Buy for $266 (normal price $330). Armcrest ProHD Wireless Security Camera No monthly fees. Pan and tilt, two-way audio, motion detection, night vision, 4 hours of free cloud storage, and a lot more. Don’t be fooled by the Armcrest’s low price tag—this thing is super powerful. Other features include 1080p recording, a MicroSD slot for even more storage, intelligent motion alerts, and much more. Sold by Beach Camera with free shipping in your choice of white or black colorways. Buy for $64 (normal price $140). Refurbished iPad Pro 9.7-inch Wi-Fi – 32GB You already know what this is. The iPad Pro is Apple’s most powerful tablet, and this is the 9.7-inch model. Like its larger sibling it features a smart connector, for wireless connection to accessories like keyboards and charging docks, and it supports the Pencil stylus. These units are professionally refurbished, and come with a 30-day guarantee, free shipping and Apple MFi accessories. The seller, Yapper Wireless, has a 90% feedback rating and says the iPad is in like-new condition. Buy for $380 (normal price new $600). Xbox One S Controller + Metal Gear Solid Bundle This new Xbox Wireless Controller that ships with Xbox One S features some exhilarating refinements to take your game control to the next level. Compared to its predecessor, it comes with a sleek, streamlined design and textured grip for better control and comfort, better wireless range when pairing with Xbox One S, new thumbstick design that reduces wear, and Bluetooth connectivity for use with compatible PC without the wireless dongle. This bundle also includes the game Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain. Buy for $40 (normal price $120). iTunes Movies Under $10 Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life Bolt Cool Runnings The Rescuers Sky High The Goonies Matilda Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief Beetlejuice Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone Adventures in Babysitting Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Land of the Lost The Karate Kid Underdog Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Annie Labyrinth Back to the Future The Spy Next Door E.T.

As you know these cards can be used in any iTunes-related store to buy things like apps, games, books, movies and TV shows. I like to stack a few up in my account and let them pay for subscription services like Netflix and HBO Now. Buy for $85 (normal price $100). Withings Body Wi-Fi Scale This popular scale has popped several times in our Daily Deals posts in recent months, but this is the cheapest it’s been by at least $6. The Withings Body Wi-Fi scale has a number of options and can provide data such as weight, BMI, fat, muscle, and bone mass measurements. It also supports up to 8 users. Retails for as much as $130. Buy for $69 with on-page coupon (normal price $130). JBL Xtreme Portable Bluetooth Speaker If you’re in the market for a portable and powerful Bluetooth speaker, check out this deal on the JBL Xtreme. To give you an idea, its size and sound are comparable to the UE Megaboom, and in most head-to-head reviews the JBL comes out on top. Features include 15 hours of playback time, dual USB charging, and splashproof fabric. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for a new unit on Amazon. Buy for $215 (normal price $300).

Buy for $190 (normal price $300). UE BOOM 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker We’ve featured the UE Boom 2 several times in our Daily Deals post because it’s one of the best portable speakers in its class. This isn’t the lowest price ever, but $50 off is a solid discount. Features include waterproof, shockproof, support for Amazon’s Alexa and Siri, 15-hour battery life and 360-degree sound that can fill up a large room. Plus you can pair multiple speakers together.

Just released: 2017 Local Search Ranking Factors survey results After taking a year off, latest version of survey again features educated opinions from almost 40 local search experts. Matt McGee on April 11, 2017 at 4:33 pm More At the risk of oversimplifying what it takes to rank in local search results in 2017, links and reviews are hot. That’s one of the many conclusions drawn by more than three dozen local SEOs who have come together in the 2017 Local Search Ranking Factors survey, just published today. This is the latest in the long-running survey that David Mihm began almost a decade ago. The survey went on hiatus in 2016, then Mihm handed it over to Darren Shaw. While reviews and links are considered more important now, citations appear to be losing importance in the survey. Still important? Yes. But as Shaw explains in his post introducing the survey, “the emphasis on citations has seen some decline (certainly in favor of links), and rightly so. In particular, there is an increasing focus on quality over quantity.” The survey breaks down what those local SEOs believe are the most important ranking factors for both local packs and localized organic search results, and also lists factors that are of more or less concern since Google’s possum update last year. This survey is one of a couple of different attempts at reverse-engineering Google’s local rankings algorithm. Andrew Shotland and Dan Liebson, two of the participants in this survey, have also separately done their own statistical analysis of the factors that influence Google’s local search results. For its part, Google has offered its own very high-level look at ranking factors in Google My Business, focusing on the ideas of relevance, distance and prominence. You’ll see those concepts analyzed in much more detail in the work of the local SEOs mentioned above.

Beyond the perceived harm to the brands whose ads appeared on these sites, the actual harm is that their ads generate revenue for these groups. Brands pulling their ads until Google/YouTube can provide a reasonable level of assurance this practice will cease include AT&T, Coca-Cola, Enterprise Holdings, Johnson & Johnson, Verizon, Walmart, and more. According to the U.K. publication The Times, more than 250 organizations including the British government, Toyota, and McDonald's have stopped advertising on YouTube in the U.K. Other brands reported to have stopped advertising include L'Oreal and Volkswagen. With 400 hours of video uploaded every minute to YouTube, the problem of policing is admittedly difficult, some say impossible. The implications for automated, programmatic advertising, said one analyst, is that "brand safety" has emerged as possibly the biggest issue facing the online ad industry today. Who wants their ad seen on an ISIS recruitment site? Although this problem has existed for years, in December the man who turned it into a public phenomenon, Eric Feinberg, just happens to have patented a "computerized system and method for detecting fraudulent of malicious enterprises," according to AdAge. 5 Myths About Sales and Marketing that Block Stronger Alignment We've been writing for years about the importance of aligning sales and marketing, of breaking down the traditional silos, of the benefits to be gained by these two functions working together. In a recent iteration of this theme, Stacey Thornberry, senior manager, field marketing at Marketo, puts her twist on this idea by debunking 5 myths that, she says, "you should stop believing right now": #1: Sales and marketing work independently. #2: Face-to-face encounters are dead; all selling happens online. #3: Sales and marketing have different goals. #4: It's hard to coordinate due to lack of transparency. #5: Sales and marketing are like cats and dogs; they'll just never get along. She also suggests 5 ways to help bridge whatever gaps and misconceptions stand in the way of sales and marketing working together better. For a further explanation of the 5 myths, see the full article. 15 Stats About Loyal Customers "Building loyalty today means a lot more than handing out points. Meeting customer expectations at every step in the journey is the new mandate for loyalty marketing," writes Giselle Abramovich, senior and strategic editor at CMO.com. Here's a quick sampling highlights from her article on an Accenture report on loyalty. Read the complete list here. Participation in loyalty programs is growing - 77% of consumers participate in the retail loyalty program, 46% have joined a hotel program, and 40% are part of an airline program. That compares with 72%, 36%, and 31%, respectively, from the previous year. Customer spend grows alongside trust: eventually, loyal customers spend 67% more than new ones. A typical U.S. household belongs to 19 to 29 different loyalty programs, but actively uses only 5 to 12 of them. Usage of loyalty programs has declined steadily since 2010 at about 2% to 3% per year. More than 50% of accumulated points, estimated to be worth $50 billion, are never redeemed - creating financial liabilities on balance sheets. 67 Texas Applebee's Are Accepting ALL Coupons in March Promotion March Madness brings out all sorts of celebrations and promotions. This March, Apple Texas, with 67 Applebee's restaurants in Texas, will accept gift cards, gift certificates, and coupons from all businesses, including direct competitors - whether they're expired or not. The offer, good for the entire month, is for up to 50% off of food purchases with any paper, plastic, or printed coupon or gift card. Apple Texas is a subsidiary of SSCP Management, owned by Sunil Dharod, who purchased 53 Sonic Drive-Ins in February under a different company called Let's Shake.

"What our clients want, and indeed what the agencies want, is more competition in the marketplace - so anything that provides more competition to the duopoly of Facebook and Google," Sorrell said to CNBC. (See videos of his late-March interview here.) According to Sorrell, "Google and Facebook account for 75 percent of digital advertising. Digital advertising is 30 percent of the market. So if you do the math, over 20 percent of worldwide advertising is controlled by Google and Facebook." Competitors vying for a portion of those online ad spends include AOL, Yahoo, Snap, and Amazon, among others. According to Sorrell, WPP spent nearly $5 billion on Google media buys last year for its clients (out of its total spend of $75 billion). Kiosk Access: Blind Customer Files Class-Action Against Fast-Food Chain As restaurants install more in-store kiosks to order and pay, The American Council of the Blind has filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of a legally blind customer in New York City. The suit against Eatsa, filed in late March, will likely have implications for restaurants that install ordering and payment kiosks - a growing trend as restaurants seek to control labor costs in light of minimum wage hikes for hourly workers. The suit has at least three noteworthy aspects: 1) Eatsa employs no waiters or cashiers, with all ordering done through its in-store kiosks; 2) accessibility requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) do not specify exactly how kiosks should provide access; and 3) state and municipal laws on this subject differ. This case is not the only one of its type. Other cases related to kiosk and vending machine accessibility include suits against Target (price readers), Coca-Cola (vending machines), and Wal-Mart (checkout display terminals). Music in Restaurants: Swedish Study Finds It Actually Does Affect Sales Playing the right music in a restaurant (i.e., music that reflects a brand's values) can increase sales by more than 9 percent. However, playing a random mix of popular music can decrease sales by more than 4 percent when compared with playing no music at all. The 2016 study, conducted by Sweden's HUI Research, used Soundtrack Your Brand's curation model and streaming platform. "When done right, music has a major positive effect on sales," said lead researcher Sven-Olov Daunfeldt in a press release. The study analyzed almost 2 million unique transactions across 16 restaurants of a major restaurant chain in Stockholm, thus its applicability to other restaurants or retail stores is uncertain, which the study's author's acknowledged in their conclusion: "Further research is needed to understand the effect in different settings." One interesting finding from the study was that "the music might affect the mood of the employees and how they approach their customers, thereby influencing business performance." A summary of the paper can be obtained here, and the full scientific working paper can be downloaded here. 5 Tips on Hyperlocal Marketing in a Mobile World First, what is hyperlocal marketing? Basically, it's "marketing to customers within your area based upon their location," says Jim Yu, founder and CEO of BrightEdge, in his article on Search Engine Land. Increased attention on hyperlocal targeting is the result of its relationship to mobile and the dramatic increase in "near me" and "nearby" searches since 2015, he notes, adding that Google has been showing signs of pushing people toward hyperlocal. "Brands that do not prepare for the impending hyperlocal trends may end up seeing a considerable drop in both online and in-person traffic," warns Yu. His 5 tips, explained in more detail and with screen shot examples, are: Master the basics. Focus on your city and things of interest in that area. If you have multiple locations, create local landing pages for each. Include any structured data markup that relates to your business on your content pages. Track your progress on a local level.

REUTERS/Eric Gaillard/Illustration/File Photo (Copyright Reuters 2016) Google pushed back against allegations it underpays female employees, detailing the methodology it uses to determine equitable compensation.  Continue Reading Below The move Tuesday came after the U.S. Department of Labor last week said it found a gender-pay gap at the Alphabet Inc. unit, which is a federal contractor, during a routine compliance probe.  The department is suing Google to compel the company to disclose more compensation data for its investigation.  Silicon Valley tech companies have been under increasing scrutiny for hiring more white men than women or people of color, along with their pay practices.  Google said each year it suggests compensation based on an employee's role, job level, location and performance ratings. Analysts who calculate what each employee should earn don't have access to an employee's gender, and an employee's manager has limited discretion to adjust the suggested amount.  Google's pay-equity model then looks at employees in the same job categories, and analyzes their compensation to ensure there is no significant differences between men and women. Last year, Google performed the analysis across 52 job categories and found no pay gap, it said.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT "Our annual analysis is extremely scientific and robust," Google said a blog post. Its methodology is available to other businesses that want to test their own compensation practices for equal pay, the company said.  A spokesman for the Labor Department said he couldn't comment because the case is still open.

Google Assistant's new shopping list is live, here's how it works Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/10 7:00pm PDTApr 10, 2017 58 Plus 1 on G+ 99 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares231 Applications Google News When Google Assistant was first introduced, you could ask it to add items to your personal shopping list. This would create a note called 'Google Assistant shopping list' in Google Keep, and you could easily manage your list from the Keep app (or web app). It makes sense that your shopping list would be in the same app as your notes, right? Apparently not to Google, because two days ago, a support article was updated to say the shopping list is moving out of Keep. Why? Because the new list ties into Google Express, so you can order what you need in fewer steps. That doesn't make the change any less stupid, but that's the reason.    When you ask Assistant to add something to your list, it is now added to the Google Express shopping list. You can actually have multiple shopping lists, and set any of them as the default. You can also share lists with other Google accounts, and they can easily add or remove items (which was a bit buggy with Keep lists). You might notice that some items (like the Vitamin Water in the above screenshot) have a tiny umbrella icon. When you tap it, it will link you to the product on Google Express. I guess that's useful? But there are some major problems with this implementation too. Unless you have the Google Express app installed, your shopping list is opened in a Chrome Custom Tab. Google could have easily added this to the Google app, but they didn't. One of my favorite aspects of the Keep list was being able to check items off with my watch (through the Android Wear Keep app). Even if you have the Express app installed, there's no way to access the list from Android Wear. In addition, adding items to the shopping list through Google Now still adds them to Keep. So in summary, the new shopping list implementation is two steps forward, one step back. Feel free to vent your frustration in the comments below.

Stupid move. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's my main problem with this. I used the shopping list for non-online purchases, while this clearly oriented for online shopping. Todd Johnson Agreed... So I can go grocery shopping and tick stuff off! Marilyndivey Google is paying $97 per hour!

Chris Sanner It's okay. I'm plenty ticked off. Teja Common, Its just an option. You can ignore it completely but removing keep integration is something we need to worry about. akshay7394 That's his point, though. Removing keep integration made it much harder to use for anybody that uses this primarily for grocery (read: *offline*) shopping javier rodriguez I vow here and now to Never purchase an item from Google Express... Unless they add YouTube red to the stupid yearly charge. whispy_snippet Never even heard of Google Express because it's not actually available in Australia. So now my Google Assistant shopping list in Keep has been gimped because... no reason at all. Todd Johnson That's what I thought when I was reading this article... What the F@&% is Google Express, look it up and yeah good work Google, change a feature that people use to something that people don't use... They are releasing the Google Home in the UK and it doesn't look like Google Express is available there? So what, UK users won't be able to use the feature? I bought a Google Home about 1.5weeks ago and am waiting for it to arrive. Yay! Upon reading the below comments, I suppose we could name a list as Coles list or Woolies List... But that is such a stupid work around! EDIT: And it's a monthly subscription!!!! "Google Express membership is $10/month or $95/year after your trial." - https://www.google.com/express/u/0/about Alex To be honest, the only difference for those of us without Express is that it opens up the shopping list in Chrome instead of Keep. That's a bit disadvantageous, but I'm also the only person I know that even knows Keep exists, let alone uses it, so nothing will significantly change. It's a weird move to tie it to this app/service that isn't even available in the region that they just launched Home in, though. I don't really follow why, if they were going to do anything, they didn't just make it a part of the Google Home app itself. All they've done is remove one bodge of tying it to another app/service and changed it to another bodge of tying it to another app/service - except this app can't even be downloaded here... akshay7394 > That's a bit disadvantageous, but I'm also the only person I know that even knows Keep exists, let alone uses it, so nothing will significantly change. I strongly disagree. What about offline-syncing? This current implementation always opens a chrome custom tab. I, for example, would always use it such that I'd note what I needed and then, later, refer to Keep (which has it sync'd offline) to see and check-off what I need and bought. Alvar Lagerlof It is possible till make offline websites. But they haven't Alex I'd assume the app previously opened Keep up in a browser too if you didn't have it installed (which would seem to be more common than not, from my anecdotal experience) - so for a lot of people it won't be any different. It's surprising that they wouldn't use Chrome's offline ability though. Has anyone actually tested it to find out? xxTheGoDxx Google Keep has 100 to 500 million users... tabguy2 Since that's the "only difference" what you're saying is that I'll still be able to see the list on my Android Wear watch? demarcmj FWIW, the price is competitive with Amazon Prime. That doesn't solve the availability issue of course. Cory S Prime offers a whole lot more than shipping. Express doesn't even scratch the surface of product availability, or benefits. If they tossed in Red, and Play Music, it be somewhat comparable...but even then. demarcmj Some people may find the overnight or sometimes same day delivery outweighs or at least balances the difference in number of products. Plus, you can get groceries from this, which Amazon charges extra for and doesn't even have competitive prices on. I'd say for the shipping aspect at least, the services both have pros and cons and which one is "better" would depend on the needs of the person. I'll give you the fact that Prime has a bunch of other services bundled in with it, but I suspect that a large percentage of people don't even use those. Cory S Express doesn't offer any perishable good on the grocery front...So it's of limited use there. Amazon doesn't charge extra for prime now which includes far more in the grocery selection area. It just has a minimum purchase price of 20 dollars. However, it does have a tip suggestion (which is optional) which I find annoying. PAY YOUR DRIVERS AMAZON. demarcmj All true... although Prime Now is only available in a small number of major cities. My point in comparing it to prime was simply directed at Todd Johnson's incredulity that "it's a monthly subscription!!!!" (four exclamation points). Of course it's a monthly subscription! bekifft Do yourself a favor and return it / cancel the order while you can. Jon Edge I would demand my money back. Oh wait... whispy_snippet Ha, well played. xxTheGoDxx Nor in Germany, nor anywhere else outside the US. OK Google, WTF? h4rr4r You know how hard it is to make services work upside down? It takes time. MatchstickMan Great, now my shopping list isn't easily accessible by the Keep widget on one of my home screens and I now have to open Home, click the sidebar menu, then select shopping list and wait for the Chrome tab to load up! Thanks, Google! rh I just tell Google to remind me next ti e I'm at a Walmart to get bread coffee razors and if I think of other stuff I tell Google again to remind me to get shaving cream ,surgery and milk, then when I pull into said parking lot I get a text reminder of what I need,..boom done and done Hayden Pearce > "and if I think of other stuff I tell Google again to remind me to get shaving cream ,surgery and milk" "OK, Google. Remind me to get surgery." rh :) MatchstickMan That's a nice workaround, but obviously not ideal... Cory S Meh, those location based reminders seem to work 1 out of 5 times for me, and in this case it isn't that useful if it did work. If I am at the store I don't need to be reminded I have a list...I need a good list app that ideally is shareable and syncs with the person shopping with me. Teja "Okay Google, show me my shopping list" should work though. Anyways I also prefer Keep integration as the list can be a shared list. MatchstickMan Ah shit, using voice assistant? That's actually a pretty good point, I'll keep that in mind. Teja Damn! you're good at sarcasm. I just gave you an alternative for "I now have to open Home, click the sidebar menu, then select shopping list and wait for the Chrome tab to load up!" I do agree that a Google Keep widget is a simpler way to access the list rather than a voice command. Especially when you have people around, as it would be awkward to talk to your phone. :P MatchstickMan Haha! I really didn't mean for it to come off as maliciously sarcastic as I'm now reading it. I sincerely never considered it! nside1 The Google app (Google search box widget) still allows me to add items to my Google keep shopping list, will that change? Corbin Davenport No idea. Nicolas Finn From the article: "In addition, adding items to the shopping list through Google Now still adds them to Keep." David Hyman Hopefully this evolves quickly into something great. Adding a widget and launcher shortcuts should make getting there very easy. And if this allows me to better manage the items on my list I'm all in. I really want to be able to ask is peanut butter on my list and have assistant say "yes" instead of just reading me my entire list Grey So "hope all the lost functionality is restored"? David Hyman Yep, pretty much all of us can hope for at this point dylan-m Of course, not living in the United States, I don't have the Google Express app. (Not that most people do anyway). So I get the dumb website instead. First thing I notice is you can add other lists. Interesting. And yet if I say "add foo to my to do list" it adds to a new list in Google Keep anyway. So apparently this feature only applies to lists with names like "shopping list." Brilliant, Google. Top notch interface design, as ever. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard Google services killed the first born children of the Google Assistant team. That's why they don't like integrating with Google services. It's personal for them. Booyabobby I rather the list stay on Keep. supersanborn The original clunky approach of being unable to use an existing keep shopping lift has been made clunkier. Guess I'll keep not using this feature. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I used Keep because it was really useful for grocery shopping in the usual supermarket. Grey Nope you have to buy from Google Express. Also, not telling you what Google Express is. newtonfb God dammit. I'm going to get slammed with messages tomorrow from friends and family asking what's going on and why did they change it....And I have no answer for them. I really do hate Google when they do shit like this. Already give us the option to keep using Keep. bozzykid I guess Google is really desperate to push Google Express that they don't care how terrible it makes Google Assistant. Great job Google! Nick I never understood why it was in keep in the first place so this makes more sense. pfmiller Because Keep is meant for keeping notes and lists. Seems pretty obvious to me. Who on Earth would think to go to the Google Home app for their shopping list? Paul_Werner Meh, I'll stick to Flipp for my shopping list/coupons/grocery store maps Hypnotoad I don't think I've been this pissed with Google since Allo... What the hell!? I don't want to use Google Express, I never signed up for it and I don't have the app, please put my shopping list back in Google keep!!! I can add to my keep shopping list via Google now, but not the assistant, what the hell is wrong with this!? Sir_Brizz Two steps sideways, two steps back. Seth Merritt Should be one step forward, two steps back. Hexlattice It's like it's not even forward at all... One step to the side, one fall down a cliff. m-p{3} If I can't use Google Keep to manage that list on a desktop and more importantly make it shared with a relative living in the same HOME, then Google fucked up. ngwoo I love it when something called an "assistant" stops providing assistance. This is probably the stupidest change Google ever made - at least let us choose which list to use. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Being an Android Site you guys should be used to Google going 2 steps forward and 1 step back. It's called Job Security. Marty McWong Just as an aside, are many Nexus 5X/6P owners are still waiting for Assistant to roll out? I've yet to receive it, and if it makes a difference I'm on 7.1.2 (via the beta), no root and with an apparently up to date (7.6.08...) Play Store... Grey Check your settings Marty McWong Oh, re-reading the original AP article (http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/02/google-assistant-coming-android-6-0-devices/) I see they mention checking language settings... Mine is set to English UK, so that's probably it (I'll check after work), thanks! Grey "Can't we just add Google Express support to Keep?" "You're fired." create812 Get your logic out of here! Kevin Sword relevant CoffeeZombie I like Keep. I have a shared shopping list on Keep with my wife. We can both add things to it and take things off that we've bought. We both have access to it at the store. I could use it from my watch while at the store, which was always nice. Google Now knew how to add items to this shared list, too. It was super convenient. "Oh, we're out of milk! Okay, Google, add milk to my shopping list." Done! Then Assistant came. I tried adding an item to the shopping list...and it created a new Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. WTF? I already have a shopping list, that's what I want to use. So, basically, I guess this doesn't affect me at this point because I've already had my nice, voice-activated shopping list taken away from me. I'll just stick with manually adding things in Keep and remembering back in 2004 when Google was cool... Rob Using Voice Search (Google Now) you can still add items to Keep! Abhimanyu Seth Since I found wunderlist, never looked at another app for shopping lists! Jose Romero More renewed focus on Google Express. This gives me a little bit more hope that Google might one day make a "Google Prime" that at least includes Google Express, Google Movies, and Google Music in the yearly subscription cost. Wynnded Keep app just got an update, lol. James Briano "OK, Google, add an iPhone to my shopping list." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No kidding. I'm getting more and more tempted to switch. Indefinite Implosion As someone with a work iPhone and only a Nexus 4 that has no SIM and little battery, don't. I miss Android. There's so many things about Android that I miss and have no good replacement for (such as Nine mail for Exchange). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ My kids have iPhones and I think they're terrific. I'd be happy with one, only I really like the S Pen too much to switch. But if Google pisses me off enough, I will switch. JD Do it you'll feel better, way less frustrated. Portzblitz You CAN'T use Google Express in about 5,292 US cities, sooo.. Is the wisdom of this intentionally hidden from us, or does this really, truly do no one- including Google- any good? b_boogey_xl *rabble rabble rabble* this one change ruins everything. how will I go on with life, my shopping list is ruined… *rabble rabble rabble* 🙄 disqus_3Gy5bmHRAv Yet another example of Google's haphazard policies towards apps. Android has become a complete frustration. The apps work differently on different devices, an app can be killed off at any minute based on a whim and important apps do not get enough attention because of Google's philosophy: Try everything, master nothing. Teja I need an option to add tasks to a to do list in keep through Google Assistant. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher R.I.P. shopping with my watch :-( http://i.imgur.com/RuHrQnK.jpg There is still a way, much more complicated: 1. Make sure NOT to install Google Express 2. Open shopping list on the phone 3. Select all → Copy 4. Open Google Keep 5. Create new list 6. Paste 7. Remove extra line spacing → Now you can still use your watch in the store. Thank you Google. DragoCubed It makes total sense for a shopping list to be in keep. Google is trying to make itself a mess. I shouldn't be used to this Google, I shouldn't be afraid to recommend a Google messaging app. James Bray I am in the UK, and I'm not able to download the Google Express App, so I need to use the website. This wouldn't be the end of the world if I could get any mobile service in my local supermarket! With this change, they effectively just removed this feature from me entirely. I only set it up on the 6th because that's when the Home came out! Annoyed! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher See my other comment, you can still copy/paste the list to Keep Tamil Arasan A new assistant for me making things simple!!! Stefan Weißhampel It's a stupid move, especially for international users who simply use the US assistant because it is a few steps ahead of the several international versions. I'm not going to order eggs from the US. Empraim can the new shopping list give me location based notifications like Keep could? It was the best feature that my phone would buzz, giving me my shopping list as I entered the supermarket Filipe Santos They make a move thinking on everyone but in the end Google Express only exist on a very very few countries.... Filipe Santos Ok Google stop being an asshole and release Google assistant for everyone myssi How about they had updated Google Keep to have a little Google Express badge on any list item buyable from express while person in supported country and zip area?? Now even on saying "Create a list" on Google Assitant makes a Google Express list -___- Chicachica Wow what a load of crap, they took an awesome feature and instead of improving it, made it much worse. I sent feedback in the apps. Hopefully when enough people bitch like that they will change it back... Jason Pagliaro Sent detailed feedback as well. Unlikely that we'll see any change but worth a shot. Crossstick Ten thumbs down. It was perfect as a Keep interface. Now we have to manually enter items in a Keep shopping list. Brilliant, Google. Albert R I think you got that reversed: this is one step forward, two steps back. Albert R Just like killing of reader, the Hangouts chrome extension, and when they stopped using xmpp for chat. They really need better product direction/someone with common sense. makapav You're giving them too much credit - they actually lack any product direction. David Dalrymple This was not a well - thought decision. I hope Google rethinks this decision. bdbplatano Google is the dumbest smart company out there Martin Send your ANGRY thoughts to Google from the Assistant's FEEDBACK :-))) Let them know at least how much they SUCK... :-))) P.S: Don't expect change, it's not like Google ever gives a sh*t about their users... They are just dumb and ignorant most of the time :) makapav Feedback? I have up on it years ago. All that Hangouts feedback went to shit. They came up with Allo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Obvious attempt to get you to shop using Google Express instead of Amazon. SavageJeep and... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And it won't work. All this will do is piss off people who used Keep for shopping lists. SavageJeep I use Express. I use Amazon. Ordering stuff off my list makes sense. That is their intent and yes it is a business decision. EDIT: spelling Bodah My biggest complaint is that you can no longer reorder the list. In my usage, I would add items throughout the week, and then reorder the list based on the layout of the store before I left. That way I wouldn't be going from one end of the store to the other because I happened to add grapes at the end of the week. demarcmj You realize that's not an "umbrella icon" right? Graham Newman I was already disliking the way that assistant added reminders were not added to keep. But im a new convert from iOS. I thought keep was great at keeping reminders gathered in one place rather than spread all over my calendar but I just need to try to get used to it. I don't like the cal app much. Metal_Link Disappointed for the same reason as the author... Can't see my list on my watch. Ugh. Navarr Barnier two forward, one back? This is more like one forward two back. Aaron Dishman https://giphy.com/gifs/superstore-lauren-ash-26ueYRXkmpTVsB7K8 Kakairo It looks like I can share the list if I view it in a web browser, but not when I view it in Google Express. The hell? This was one of our most used features in the house, it will take a lot of getting used to. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Google giveth and the Google taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Google. (This change is a transparent attempt to compete with Amazon.) create812 What is Google Express? Why can't I see my list on my watch? Why can't I check items off? How can my SO and I collaborate on the same shopping list? Oh no Google WHAT! is you doing? Roberto Virga "... have a tiny umbrella icon" From "don't be evil" to "resident evil": Google has now become Umbrella Corp. :D JD I can imagine the Google Lunch room now. You got different cliques sitting at different tables. None of them are allowed to sit in different cliques, you sit with your own and that's it. You got the G-Home Table, The Android Table, Android Wear table etc, G-Apps. Each one planning how to shank the other like in a prison. Then you have the guys who are in charge of Adopting Material design in to G-Apps walking around outside like giant chickens pecking at the ground crowing randomly at passerbys. Roy So they're basically removing the two things that I love about using keep for this: Android Wear Sharing the list with my wife (her phone has yet to get google assistant and neither of us can get the Google Express app). Good job Google. It must be nice to be able to consistently ignore and piss off your users because we're not really your customers, your advertisers are. Well, I hope one day you realize that your products will move to greener pastures when a company comes around that can do what you do but doesn't see us as widgets to be sold to advertisers, but as people that are the foundation of your income. Advertisers won't pay you a dime if you have no one to show their ads to! Cecil Hardwood Why are you guys surprised or disappointed ? This is Google. Look at messaging and reminders. Those are all over the place too. Google is becoming more and more incompetent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome sucks now. It used to be my favorite browser. Unfortunately, there's no competition anymore. Edge sucks more. Firefox works great but is slow as fark. Opera is great, but it's based on Chrome. Merf This is as bad as it sounded. Vons Records Good move, Google. Now I'm back to having zero reasons to interact with the assistant. Except for telling it to shut up when it overhears me setting up the backup phone I use for flashing ROMs. R.J. Great, no widget for Express as well, so my shopping list isn't viewable with all my other notes on my home screen. Glich damit i use a extra home screen of my phone as one big keep wigget for my shopiing list. o well so much for that David Lloyd Thomas Sucks because Google Express isn't available in the UK! No way of accessing the list without adding something to it 😕😕 Jon Edge Maybe this has already been posted...I didn't read all the comments. I'm not saying this will solve everyone's issues, but it's at least a work around I can live with. Once the list is launched, you can pin it to your homescreen. That makes it easily accessible, As a matter of fact, it's one step shorter than accessing through Keep (unless you keep that list open all the time). Just now, I copied the address of that Chrome Tab and emailed that to myself. I launched that link on Chrome on my desktop and now I have that bookmarked in my Bookmarks Bar. Pretty easy access to my list on mobile and desktop. I can live with that. Who cares if they have integrated this new list with Google Express. Use it or don't. That really shouldn't be an issue for anyone. I'll bet this is only temporary anyway and that eventually this finds its way into the Google Home app (or somewhere else). LondonLeedsFan Is Google Express their attempt at Prime then? I wouldn't know as don't think it's in the UK. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes. They want to compete with Amazon Prime because you can order stuff with the Amazon Echo. h4rr4r I don't understand the issue here. Just use keep, who the heck wants to yell at their phone? surethom No express in the UK & cellular signel In supermarkets is very bad so shopping list DOES NOT work in UK as it uses a web link, we NEED an offline sync version. xxTheGoDxx So, summarize: Google relies now on app not available outside of the US Express doesn't work on Android Wear, nor tablets from what I have read. You can instead open your shopping list in Chrome, which means you won't have access to it if the page / app reloads or you miss click unless you have a working data connection in your local grocery store / super market. Good job guys! BTW, when does your next totally useless messaging app launch? And have you ever thought about moving the ability to take selfies into Google Keep instead of the camera app? That would be so cool. thereasoner Perhaps Wear support is coming shortly?

Society has become obsessed with it; how to get rid of it; how to avoid it; how to spot it. Google has gone through tremendous pains to suppress it from their search engine results as effectively as possible, and they’ve succeeded to a large degree. But with success also comes failure. In this case, Google’s attempts to combat fake news have resulted in drastic changes to its algorithm; changes that pose real threats to honest journalism. Snapshot of the front of Google headquarters in Seattle, Washington. [Image by SEASTOCK/Shutterstock] If an Internet news writer ever tells you that Google is never on their mind, they’re lying. We’re borderline obsessed with it. What does Google like? What does it hate? What will it ignore and what will it favor? People base their whole careers on trying to figure out what makes Google “tick,” so to speak, though no one, except maybe those whose job it is to program its algorithm, have or will ever completely figure it out. There are several reasons for this, but more than anything it comes down to this: no one is supposed to be able to figure it out. Google “Fred” Update Sometime during late January and early February, Google made a substantial change to their algorithm. These changes impacted the entire online news community, some worse than others. Moz, a search engine watchdog, first noted this change on February 1. Within a week, Moz confirmed that a significant update of Google’s algorithm had taken place. Though at this time there’s been no official moniker given to the update by Google, unofficially it’s been named “Fred.” Google’s Latest Search Algorithm Update “Fred” – A Boon or Bane? FRED is LIVE – The latest Google search algorithm update, (possible launch date as per source: 8th March 2017). All you need to know about Fred is here in the infographic. Share your experience of meeting FRED in the comments below. #Obbserv # DigitalMarketing #SEO #NewUpdate #Algorithm #Google #GoogleFred #GoogleFredAlgorithm #SEORankings #Keywords #WebsiteTraffic A post shared by Obbserv (@obbserv) on Mar 30, 2017 at 4:50am PDT According to The Stack, Fred “wreaked havoc on a huge tranche of middling blog and news-style sites, some of which report catastrophic losses in traffic.” Some believe its purpose was to eliminate websites that generate income through generous advertising rather than valuable, factual content, but this theory has been refuted by others, who say they’ve witnessed sites with minimal ad content that once did well now failing miserably as a consequence to Google’s latest update. Dropping Google Ranking? Welcome The Latest Fred Update! https://t.co/pj4K57PgW9 pic.twitter.com/b3ipiR5oJB — Readizine (@readizine) April 8, 2017 It didn’t take long for experts to ruminate on the possibility Fred was largely implemented to filter out so-called “fake news.” Meanwhile, while many alternative media sites are suffering substantial losses in traffic in response to Fred, mainstream news agencies, though there’s evidence they were impacted by Fred’s changes at first, seem to be doing as well as they’ve always done. Outlets like CNN, Fox News, ABC, NBC, etc are automatically given good page rank because of their domain authority. Essentially this means that because of their names and mainstream status, they’re considered by Google to be more trustworthy than non-mainstream outlets. Google Fred Algorithm Confirmed & Cites Overall Quality Issues https://t.co/wS7GyzxQcR pic.twitter.com/SHtMCJsYDv — Ben Brausen (@BenBrausen) April 4, 2017 Scrutinization of Fred has suggested that in order for a site’s content to score a high Google ranking, it must contain similar information and claims as other high-ranking results. Though this works to successfully eliminate false content, it’s also a huge hindrance to honest journalism from writers of lesser-known websites. Imagine being a journalist of an alternative network, and as luck would have it, you’ve come across a huge tip having to do with a trending story. It’s big and you know it, so you race to publish the new information only to find that Google has surpassed your story because more “reputable” sites haven’t yet mentioned what you’ve mentioned. As an honest journalist, you deserve recognition and credit for that story, but the fake news hysteria, which ironically was originally coined by these so-called “reputable” sources, has cheated you out of that opportunity. Google Fact Check Now, Google has made it possible for web users to see which search results are “true” and which are “false,” as a feature of the fact-checking software first launched by the company last autumn. While on the surface it may seem like this is a step in the right direction, dig a little deeper and you’ll come to find that there are major biases at work; biases which will serve as a direct influence to whether or not content is dubbed as “true” or “false.” “After assessing feedback from both users and publishers, we’re making the Fact Check label in Google News available everywhere, and expanding it into Search globally in all languages.” Basically, the people of Google believe that you need their assistance to figure out the truth, which is, among many things, downright insulting. Google announced changes on how fact-check articles will appear in search results. Image below. Announcement here: https://t.co/GVrLO5st0C pic.twitter.com/VWSPD6SH0s — FactCheck.org (@factcheckdotorg) April 7, 2017 Even if these fact-checkers utilized by Google aren’t by themselves biased, which is certainly up for debate, they’re reliant on biased sources in their quest for the truth. Put simply, if you’re not someone who trusts the mainstream media, you probably shouldn’t have faith that Google’s fact-checking system will provide you with “the whole truth and nothing but the truth.” Barriers to honest journalism have been established. Perhaps it’s just the nature of the beast, but for those of us dedicated to factual news reporting, it’s a threat to one of the world’s most sacred of things: truth.

Justin Sullivan via Getty images The Department of Labor keeps finding new evidence of “systemic compensation disparities” in their continuing investigation of Google’s workforce gender discrimination practices. Janet Herold, a spokesperson for the Department of Labor (DoL) told the Guardian on Friday that “The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry.” (Italics mine, because when you have to use the word extreme in an already extremely sexist industry, then you know it’s bad). Google, for one, disagrees. Yesterday Eileen Naughton, Google’s Vice President of ‘People Operations’ (good Lord), posted a statement from the company on their blog, saying they were “taken aback by this assertion, which came without any supporting data or methodology.” But Google refused to provide valuable data on employee compensation to the DoL back in September, saying the request was “too broad,” and citing privacy concerns – so the DoL decided to take them to court. Google also released their own methodology in response to the wage gap allegations. Employee compensation, the company says, is measured by “role, job level, job location as well as current and recent performance ratings.” Then the information undergoes a four-stage, “gender blind” process using an “equity pay model” that compares salaries between genders and corrects for disparities. Google's four-point equity pay model system. In fact, Google feels so confident about this system that they tweeted earlier in the month that the company had “completely closed the gender pay gap globally.” But solving gender inequality in the workplace takes more than just figuring out equal pay, and includes matters of retention (Who is staying? Who is leaving?), promotion (Who is being put in upper management positions?), and visibility (promoting employee’s exposure while avoiding tokenism). There’s other more nuanced factors that account for workplace discrimination as well. As Gizmodo points out, “Although salary is calculated by analysts who can’t see employee gender, they factor in performance ratings which themselves are subjective and shaped by biases.” Also not on Google's side: the glaring fact that (even according to their own data) nearly 70 percent of their workforce is, in fact, male. But to their credit, the company has tried to make improvements to gender-based policies before: when they increased paid maternity leave in 2007 from 12 to 18 weeks, they cut the rate at which new mothers quit by half. 3 You might also be interested in these: Sponsored: Martial Arts Meet Modern Dance at UW’s Meany Center King County Executive Dow Constantine's Proposed Arts Tax Is Dead For Now by Heidi Groover Pedestrian Zones Are Returning to Pike Street This Summer by Ana Sofia Knauf Most Popular in Slog Savage Love Letter of the Day: Safe Play During Moresomes with Strangers by Dan Savage Was it Legal For Mayor Ed Murray to Use Campaign Funds to Discredit His Accusers? by Heidi Groover Google Argues with the Labor Department About Their 'Extreme' Gender Pay Gap by Amber Cortes An Immigrant Detainee at Tacoma Northwest Detention Center Tells Us Why He’s On Hunger Strike by Steven Hsieh Pedestrian Zones Are Returning to Pike Street This Summer by Ana Sofia Knauf Sean Spicer: Giving One Terrible Press Conference After Another by Leilani Polk Everything You Need To Know About the Two Massive Tax Marches Planned for This Weekend by Rich Smith Newsletters Sign up for the latest news and to win free tickets to events Stranger Tickets Buy tickets to events around Seattle Stranger Things To Do Comprehensive calendar of Seattle events Stranger Things To Do App The easiest way to find Seattle's best events This Week's Issue Print Archives Publication Info Masthead Ad Info & Rates Distribution Jobs at The Stranger Contact Check it out Follow Us RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram All contents © Index Newspapers LLC 1535 11th Ave (Third Floor), Seattle, WA 98122 Contact | Privacy Policy | Terms of Use | Takedown Policy All contents © Index Newspapers LLC 1535 11th Ave (Third Floor), Seattle, WA 98122 Contact | Privacy Policy | Terms of Use | Takedown Policy

Close A Google exec owns and tracks a Viper ACR Sean Szymkowski Apr 11, 2017 The workforce of Silicon Valley may have a stereotype of driving efficient and luxurious vehicles, but Google's Vice President of Engineering, Ben Sloss, kicks that idea to the curb. He's the same executive who placed the winning bid for a special Ferrari 599XX Evo in a charity auction and whose wife tracks a Ferrari FXX K. Engineering executive during the week, track day warrior by the weekend. This time, though, Sloss discusses the latest addition to his garage of performance and track cars: a Dodge Viper ACR. Not only does he own one of the most coveted Vipers in existence, but he also utilized the Viper's "1 of 1" program, meaning, Sloss' Viper ACR is unlike any other in the world. And saying the Google executive likes his Viper ACR is an understatement. The smiles produced by the Viper ACR's track weaponry are fully genuine with each camera pan as Sloss describes how the ACR felt during a track day outing. Sloss goes on to state that the Viper ACR led him to his fastest lap time outside of a $1 million car, undercutting his lap time goal of 1:36 by two seconds. Again, you'd think Sloss would be a sensible guy with his technological and engineering background. But, no. He even dailies the Viper ACR to work on occasion. Maybe our initial stereotype is utterly wrong since even Sloss acknowledges the fact most engineering types house a love for high-performance driving. Recall, Bill Gates was a massive Porsche 959 fan back in the day. And if it's high-performance driving to love, the Viper ACR delivers those feelings in spades, outmuscling the impeccable 918 Spyder and P1. Check out Sloss' story in the video.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint SAN FRANCISCO – Fingerprint sensors have turned modern smartphones into miracles of convenience. A touch of a finger unlocks the phone — no password required. With services like Apple Pay or Android Pay, a fingerprint can buy a bag of groceries, a new laptop or even a $1 million vintage Aston Martin. And pressing a finger inside a banking app allows the user to pay bills or transfer thousands of dollars. While such wizardry is convenient, it has also left a gaping security hole. New findings published Monday by researchers at New York University and Michigan State University suggest that smartphones can easily be fooled by fake fingerprints digitally composed of many common features found in human prints. In computer simulations, the researchers from the universities were able to develop a set of artificial “MasterPrints” that could match real prints similar to those used by phones as much as 65 percent of the time. The researchers did not test their approach with real phones, and other security experts said the match rate would be significantly lower in real-life conditions. Still, the findings raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of fingerprint security on smartphones. “It’s almost certainly not as worrisome as presented, but it’s almost certainly pretty darn bad,” said Andy Adler, a professor of systems and computer engineering at Carleton University in Canada, who studies biometric security systems. “If all I want to do is take your phone and use your Apple Pay to buy stuff, if I can get into 1 in 10 phones, that’s not bad odds.” Full human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but the finger scanners on phones are so small that they read only partial fingerprints. When a user sets up fingerprint security on an Apple iPhone or a phone that runs Google’s Android software, the phone typically takes eight to 10 images of a finger to make it easier to make a match. And many users record more than one finger — say, the thumb and forefinger of each hand. Since a finger swipe has to match only one stored image to unlock the phone, the system is vulnerable to false matches. “It’s as if you have 30 passwords and the attacker only has to match one,” said Nasir Memon, a professor of computer science and engineering at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering, who is one of three authors of the study, which was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security. The other authors are Aditi Roy, a postdoctoral fellow at NYU’s Tandon School, and Arun Ross, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State. Memon said their findings indicated that if you could somehow create a magic glove with a MasterPrint on each finger, you could get into 40 to 50 percent of iPhones within the five tries allowed before the phone demands the numeric password, known as a personal identification number. Apple said the chance of a false match in the iPhone’s fingerprint system was 1 in 50,000 with one fingerprint enrolled. Ryan James, a company spokesman, said Apple had tested various attacks when developing its Touch ID system, and also incorporated other security features to prevent false matches. Google declined to comment. The actual risk is difficult to quantify. Apple and Google keep many details of their fingerprint technology secret, and the dozens of companies that make Android phones can adapt Google’s standard design in ways that reduce the level of security. Stephanie Schuckers, a professor at Clarkson University and director of the Center for Identification Technology Research, was cautious about the implications of the MasterPrint findings. She said the researchers used a midrange, commercially available software program that was designed to match full fingerprints, limiting the broader applicability of their findings. “To really know what the impact would be on a cellphone, you’d have to try it on the cellphone,” she said. She noted that cellphone-makers and others who use fingerprint security systems are studying anti-spoofing techniques to detect the presence of a real finger, such as looking for perspiration or examining patterns in deeper layers of skin. A new fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm, for example, uses ultrasound. Phone-makers also said that the ease of touching a finger to unlock a phone meant more users actually turned on security features instead of leaving their phones unlocked — a common habit in the early days of smartphones. Ross acknowledged the limitations of the work. “Most of the current smartphone vendors do not give us access to the fingerprint image,” he said. Still, the team’s fundamental finding that partial fingerprints are vulnerable to spoofing is significant, said Chris Boehnen, the manager of the federal government’s Odin program, which studies how to defeat biometric security attacks as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. “What’s concerning here is that you could find a random phone, and your barrier to attack is pretty low,” Boehnen said. Phone-makers could easily increase security by making it harder to match the partial fingerprint, he said, “but the average phone company is more worried about you being annoyed that you have to put your finger against the phone two or three times than they are with someone breaking into it.” Adding a larger fingerprint sensor would also decrease the risk, Boehnen said. And some newer biometric security options, such as the iris scanner in Samsung’s new Galaxy S8, are harder to fool. Memon said that despite his research he was still using fingerprint security on his iPhone. “I’m not worried,” he said. “I think it’s still a very convenient way of unlocking a phone. But I’d rather see Apple make me enter the PIN if it’s idle for one hour.” View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Variety April 11 Wheels to Watch: Dodge unleashes Demon with 840 horsepower Dodge has unleashed the Demon. The Fiat Chrysler brand is laying claim to the fastest production car in the U.S. The Demon Challenger is a freaky-fast 840-horsepower gasoline burner. It can go from zero to 60 (97 kilometers per hour) in 2.3 seconds. That beats the Tesla Model S P100D sedan, which hits 60 in 2.5 seconds. Dodge used explosions, burnouts and a small drag strip to roll out the car ahead of the New York International Auto Show press days. The company even brought in Fast and Furious star Vin Diesel for effect. The street-legal Demon also can hit 140 mph while running a quarter mile in 9.65 seconds, about two seconds faster than a typical muscle car. It's available in the fall.

You do it, I do it, everybody does it. And now Google (GOOG, GOOGL) wants to get in on your TV time with its new YouTube TV streaming service. Available in select cities for $35 a month, YouTube TV promises 40 channels of live TV including the five major broadcast channels: ABC, CBS, CW, FOX and NBC. Google, though, is entering an increasingly crowded market with a wide variety of different channel offerings that can be difficult to parse when all you want to do is watch “The Bachelor” and eat your KFC $20 Fill-Up in your comfy chair. But since I care so much, I’m breaking down each of the major over-the-top cable streaming services so you can get back to watching the rose ceremony. Still, not all over-the-top services offer the same channels. YouTube TV is missing Turner and Viacom properties. Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation Vue is also missing Viacom channels, while Dish’s (DISH) Sling TV and AT&T’s (T) DirecTV Now don’t offer CBS. That said, at least one of these options could be right for you. YouTube TV View photos We’ve been waiting a long time for Google’s big TV play and it’s officially here. YouTube TV features 40 channels and gets you everything from the major broadcast channels to a huge array of sports stations. In fact, YouTube TV gives you 13 sports channels and the option to add on Fox Soccer Plus. Outside of that, you get Fox News, MSNBC, Disney, National Geographic, Bravo, USA, FX and E!, among others. Google says it will add AMC and BBC World News to its lineup in the near future. You can also add Showtime for $11 a month extra. But YouTube TV has some drawbacks. First off, the service doesn’t carry Turner properties like CNN, TBS, TNT and, importantly for me, Cartoon Network. You also don’t get Viacom channels like MTV or Comedy Central. What’s worse, there doesn’t appear to be an option to add on HBO just yet, only Showtime. What’s more, YouTube TV isn’t available for Roku streaming devices or Apple TV. To address that, Google will provide you with a free Chromecast so you can stream your favorite shows to your big-screen. Still, if you’re a Roku or Apple TV user, that means having to bounce between those devices and your Chromecast just to watch different channels, which can be annoying. Sony PlayStation Vue View photos Sony’s PlayStation Vue is the Japanese tech giant’s over-the-top streaming play and it’s actually a quality offering. Rather than a one-size-fits-all offering, Sony offers four different packages depending on the number of channels you want to watch and how much you want to pay each month. The base offering, which starts at $40 per month, gets you 49 channels including ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, as well as CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, ESPN and ESPN 2, FS1 and FS2 and a slew of others. Oh, and Cartoon Network. Sony’s $45 package gets you more than 60 channels, while the $55 package gets you more than 90 channels. Then there’s the $75 option, which includes the NFL Network and HBO. Sony, however, recently did away with Viacom content like Comedy Central. So if you’re trying to watch the “Daily Show,” you’re out of luck. Vue is available on a number of devices including, naturally, Sony’s PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, web browsers, Apple TV, Roku, Amazon’s (AMZN) Fire TV and your mobile devices. If you’re already a PlayStation fan, Vue is a solid choice. Read More Sling TV View photos Dish’s Sling TV offers three packages Orange, Blue and Orange + Blue with a host of additional add-ons to customize your viewing options. The Orange package costs $20 per month and gets you 30 channels including ESPN, AMC, CNN, TBS, Comedy Central, Travel Channel and, of course, Cartoon Network. What you don’t get are the basic broadcast channels like ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC or the CW. The Blue package costs $25 per month and gets you 45 channels including FOX and NBC. The Orange + Blue package, which costs $40 per month, gets you 50 channels. Here’s the thing, though — you can add a range of different channels to any of the three packages. For instance, the New Extra add-on gets you MSNBC, BBC World News and Headline News for $5. Comedy Plus Extra, also $5, gets you MTV, Spike, MTV2 and CMT, which means you can watch “Steve Austin’s Broken Skull Challenge,” the greatest show on television. Curiously, Sling doesn’t include CBS. So “Big Bang Theory” fans, you know who you are, won’t be able to watch their favorite show. Sling TV is available on most mainstream TV streaming devices including Apple TV, Roku and Amazon’s Fire TV players, as well as Apple, Android and Amazon phones and tablets, Mac and Windows computers and Microsoft’s Xbox One. Unfortunately, you can’t watch Sling TV on your PlayStation. If you’re the kind of person who wants greater control over what channels you pay for, Sling TV is the way to go. AT&T DirecTV Now View photos Like Sling TV, AT&T’s DirecTV Now allows you to purchase different packages of channels based on what you want to want and how much you want to pay each month. The base offering starts at $35 per month and gets you more than 60 channels including ABC, NBC and FOX, but not CBS and the CW. You also get CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, ESPN, Disney, Cartoon Network and Comedy Central. The $50 option gets you more than 80 channels, while the $60 package gets more than 100. The largest option is the $70 package, which gives you more than 120 channels, enough to keep you on your couch for quite some time. You can subscribe to HBO GO as part of your package for an additional fee. AT&T lets you watch DirecTV Now on your Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Android phone and tablet, iPad and iPhone, Chromecast and web browsers. But you can’t watch it on your Chromecast with the iOS app, your Roku or Xbox One. As with YouTube TV, DirecTV Now gives you a streaming device, in this case a Fire TV stick, with your first month’s payment.

The agency found "systemic compensation disparities," regional director Janette Wipper said at a hearing in San Francisco, according to reports. The DoL confirmed the accuracy of the testimony to the E-Commerce Times. The hearing was in connection with the department's lawsuit over Google's failure to hand over detailed compensation data about employees at its Mountain View, California, headquarters. "Based on what Google has produced thus far and based upon the department's investigation thus far, this investigation has revealed significant evidence of discrimination in pay against women at Google's headquarters," Department of Labor spokesperson Jose Carnevali told the E-Commerce Times. Google has vehemently denied Whipper's allegations, insisting that its own analyses show no gender pay gap, and that the Labor Department has not provided any data or shared the methodology underlying its findings. Compliance Failure As part of its equal opportunity compliance review, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs in 2015 asked Google to provide compensation data and documents from its headquarters. Since Google is a federal contractor, it must comply with the review. The DoL earlier this year filed suit against Google, asking the court to cancel all of Google's federal contracts and bar the firm from all future contracts. Gender discrimination has been an issue with particular currency in Silicon Valley for many years. In recent years, several high-profile cases have shone a spotlight on it. Among them were the US$16 million lawsuit Ellen Pao brought against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, which she lost. Earlier this year, Pao returned to Silicon Valley as a partner in Kapor Capital, and chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact. The pay gap remains a critical issue. Sixty-three percent of women receive lower salary offers than their male counterparts for the same job, while 53 percent of the time companies interview only male candidates for a job opening, according to a study Hired released last week. Systemic Issues Gender pay disparities are a systemic problem in the technology industry, according to Derecka Mehrens, executive director of Working Partnerships USA and cofounder of Silicon Valley Rising. Women hold only 25 percent of the high-wage, high skill programming and engineering jobs in the industry, she told the E-Commerce Times. They hold 40 percent of the blue-collar, subcontracted jobs that serve the industry, yet those jobs pay only one-sixth as much as the higher-skilled jobs. "If tech leaders are serious about reducing the gender gap, they need to address ... pay discrimination among their direct employees, and raise wages for the subcontracted workers who keep their campuses running smoothly," Mehrens said. The DoL earlier this year filed suit against Oracle alleging the company paid white males more than it paid Asian, African American and female workers in similar roles, while favoring Asian-Americans for certain product development and other technical jobs. Oracle previously has denied the allegations, but the company declined to comment for this story. The DoL last fall sued Palantir Technologies, led by billionaire investor and PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, on allegations it discriminated against Asian job applicants. The company has denied those allegations. David Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey. He has written for Reuters, Bloomberg, Crain's New York Business and The New York Times.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 134 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares270 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company. I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

AJKahn A very brave pick for the first post. Guess I'm going to be looking forward for your "hopefully weekly" columns, Trevor (most likely not the one from GTA V). MrDrWho13 Is this the guy you hired after that ad? Was this the article which got him the place? I quite like this writing style. VAVAMk_2 We wouldn't be giving him the warm welcome to AP if we weren't hard on him ;) dcdttu "...couldn't care less" abc Any writer whose first post on this site is criticism of Google (especially the Pixel), gets my support! A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! Indian Yes we guessed him to be the new man by reading his name, Trevor "Newman" Marcie Mtz Good article...But it's "couldn't care less". chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine CF542 6 months? I replaced my S7E three times in four months for chronic and various problems before giving up and going Pixel blueman24 "Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES." "I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge" "Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months." You brought a $700 S7edge and not a $300 oneplus, so it should not be acceptable for it to become less responsive after 6 months? Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. WARLORD VIII On the up side the Pixel isn't catching on fire 😎 das I thought that was a feature for survivalists. :P Eric Works for me. The most stable software wise of any phone I've ever used. Paid 300 for mine and prefer it over the s7. Curved screens don't like screen protector. Nothing like water resistant on a phone that looks like a cat danced on it. Another huge plus is the lack of carrier spam. I'm not getting all the complaints. Google showed us we'd be getting if we choose to buy it. I for one have no regrets about doing so. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. Kristian Ivanov I'm not going to comment on the actual design, I want to hear thoughts comparing it to the undesputed legend - Nexus 5 (design only) JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. CF542 The only thing that the S7/S8 truly suffer from is having Samsung as a parent. They turned the phone (s) into a piece of bloatware full of crappy software that nobody wants. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Ryan Those are usability preferences. I will agree the settings are a freaking nightmare to find, but I dont go into settings often. Right now, and for over a year now, bluetooth audio has been straight-up broken. They implemented that absoloute volume BS without coding how to handle devices that dont send volume information, breaking it in my car. Then the idiots put developer setting that is to allow you to disable it but they didnt even test it and the user doesnt have permissions to change that setting, so the switch does nothing. That is a BIG bug, and one that Google has refused to address for over a year. Then there is the fact that my phone, and the first Nexus phone I have had to deal with this on, has to be rebooted every few weeks because it slows down horribly. Jack Smith Based on what? Had every iPhone since the 3G and relatively recently added Android as carry both and Android is excellent. So much is written is just simply not true. Suggest actually give recent Android a try and you might be surprised ;). Ryan Ive had android for coming up on 8 years, HTC Hero was the first, then one more HTC before going Nexus. Been on Nexus and still am with my 5x. I know, personally, some of the MAJOR shortcomings of Googles implementation of Android. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. ScratchC The problem with the Internet is how do I know you actually own one? Or are you just a troll. In any case, I unfortunately had to pass on the Pixel my S6 shit the bed and I had just upgraded to the S7. My gf tho.. I somehow convinced her to grab a Pixel on Verizon. She has not had not 1 issue. I'm not saying they don't exist. It's just not as bad as commenters trying to win an argument make it seem. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of the 22 Pixel photos had halos. None of the LG G6 photos had halos. whispy_snippet Wow. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. Vega007 My Pixel is, by far, the best phone I have ever had for battery life. Christopher Bement I'm only going with devices I've actually used, I haven't touched a Pixel personally. All I can say is it's day and night between the N6 and S7 on a given work day where I'm calling, texting and emailing almost constantly. Vega007 That's a good point, it all depends on what phone we have used to compare it to. I have never used a S7 Edge, but I have used a S7. While the battery life was fine, the Pixel does do better for my usage (I'm using the 5" btw). And that's the real key to battery issue is personal use. We all use our devices differently so battery life will always be subjective. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. ScratchC The iPhone has been in trouble for some time. It's why it started playing catch up (Forget current sales up to now. Poll after poll, iPhone users are bored of iPhones) Actually Google's Android is in trouble as well. Samsung is doing their own thing. Google needs to put it's foot down or compete. The Pixel is an attempt to do so. It's not perfect by any means. it's better than nothing and it was a solid first entry. If you simply don't like it.. Buy elsewhere. that's the beauty of Android. I think you guys forget, that out of our fanboy bubble, most people when they think of Android have a distinct definition. I'm talking the average consumer...they think Android = cheap phone from prepaid carrier that's slow, plastic, horrible camera & full of bugs. Or.. Android = Samsung Galaxy. Your average consumer still doesn't know what a Pixel is nvm that they don't even know what a Nexus was. Android phones need to be a premium product to compete. They need to charge the amount of money it takes for proper R&D.. Customer support etc. Google cannot sell at a loss and accomplish this. This very reason is why Samsung holds the Android crown. Regardless of your opinion towards their devices. Remember that Carrier subsidizing is how Galaxy devices sell by the millions. Iphones as well. Google is on the right path. They just need to bring the next Pixel to all carriers. Lindsay Meyer You're right. I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved those iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices), and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick (and their new iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to throw my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability, and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. mrjayviper Fairly new? How long have they been selling Nexus phones and other devices? MJ Let me get this straight... You left a comment without reading the whole discussion? I already very clearly laid out an actual argument but thanks for your input. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. madcanada That's correct, I'm pissed that Pixel gets a better camera software while Nexus is fundamentally the same in the department. I understand your point about camera being a combination of both hardware and software, but unlike, say, Apple, where each iteration is actually better in terms of hardware, and older iPhones still get whatever features they can physically run, Google decided to accentuate the difference by simply denying their last year phone the same updates. Where Apple only denies updates when the old phone can't actually handle them Google is simply abandoning their last year model to justify the price of the Pixel. whispy_snippet Except there's one key difference. Unlike iPhones that release each year, the Nexus 6P is not of the Pixel lineage. The Pixel is the first of its kind. madcanada That makes not a shred of difference in the argument I'm making. I find denying last year phone updates it perfectly capable of running, so you can justify the price of the new phone ethically questionable. I don't care if they rebranded, their decision to not give Nexus the updates it can handle is only guided by the fact that they wanted to charge twice the price for Pixel, and they couldn't have if Nexus got the goodies. whispy_snippet Ethically questionable? No, mate, it's business. Google's ultimate responsibility is maximising profits for shareholders. You're cranky that your 6P can't do what the more expensive a Pixel can do. Now imagine how Pixel owners would feel if they saw cheaper, older phones from the same company doing exactly the same thing as theirs. Again, I sympathise to an extent, but ultimately you get what you pay for. If you want the Pixel experience, buy it. madcanada I'm not cranky because my Nexus 6P can't do things Pixel can, on the contrary, I get full Pixel experience with free unlimited full size photo upload, Pixel launcher, Pixel camera, and day one Google Assistant on Nexus 6P. I'm cranky because I need to go to XDA to get them goodies. I understand it's business, but if you want to sell charge twice for the phone - sell a better phone, give us a better camera, bigger battery life, and don't downgrade our goddamn speakers. whispy_snippet Mate, you're simply not making sense anymore. You're effectively wanting something for nothing. You want Google to give you a Pixel quality camera experience on an older, less expensive phone from an entirely different lineage - for free. You're not entitled to free stuff. I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree. madcanada you can disagree all your want, i outlined my gripe with Google in the first post, then you decided to argue about the camera. New lineage or not, when you market Nexus as the phone that gets all the Google love, and then you just leave users behind right next generation simply to justify the price hike of new Pixel - that's low. Apple's feature fragmentation is driven solely by the hardware - newer phones get new exclusive features because older models can't do the same thing physically. Google is creating artificial fragmentation in order to justify twice the price. That's not the Google I remember and that's not the direction I like. Obviously it's their choice. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? Mix Sounds like you have not done this before because sending your phone to Google first, waiting for them to get it and look it over THEN sending a replacement is, 100%, the bad choice. Having them send you the phone first and put a hold on your creditcard is the better and faster choice! Complaining gets you nothing, USA got free daydream headsets, Canadians got nothing. The phone, after taxes, was $1,320.48 - close enough for me to complain about it at the $1,400 point, lol. John Doe OMG, YOU CAN'T READ? That is what I said Google does but you said you had to wait 7 days for your phone but they send you the phone first then you send yours in so no waiting. Yes I have done this before. With Apple, Google, and other companies...it is standard practice. No, they don't charge you taxes they just put a hold of the price of the phone not your total purchase price. Maybe it is just different in Canada...you should stop buying Google products there *rolls eyes* Lindsay Meyer If your damaged, soon-to-be-returned Pixel phone is broken and unusable, there would indeed be a waiting period to have a working phone in either case, because, being unable to easily switch your device at a physical brick and mortar store, you would be at the mercy of waiting for for Google's mailed replacement to have a working phone again. John Doe Google sens it next day here in the US Mix You straight up told me that I chose the bad option: "Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault." when I did not choose the bad option. If my phone bricked, which it did, and it takes 7 days for Googles phone to get to me I have no phone for 7 days, that is waiting without a phone! I think we are both right, 12 of this and a dozen of that, lol. <3 Stuff in Canada is more expensive and shipping generally sucks. I normally chose 2 day shipping with Amazon and get refunded shipping costs because the shipping companies miss the delivery date constantly. Nexus 4 and 5 have been sweet, my Pixel experience has been garbage. Their customer service has been good though so yay for that. Lindsay Meyer Canadian $ ≠ US $ John Doe Yeah but the phone still does not cost $1,400 in canada so yeah destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I'd far rather spend 5-10 minutes online from home getting my replacement shipped to me for free than having to go into a store, talk to someone who's less knowledgeable about my phone than I am, convince them to get it replaced, and then pay them an additional $35 to have them facilitate my phone then getting shipped to their store where I have to return to pick it up. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. Aaron Yeah, top notch. Tell that to all those iPhone 6plus users with the death screen disease and Apple does nothing... mrjayviper Out of warranty? I don't think Google supports out of warranty devices to donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. Berni Hargrove Hold on now, Chromebooks are more than good enough if you go price for price on a cheap laptop. There's no way that $200 Windows laptop with 2gigs of ram is performing on the same level as a $200 Chromebook with the same specs. In addition the reason why "Good Enough" applies to this is because the average person wants to pay very little for a computer, but have it be "fast and last a long time" to effectively browse and use Office. Anyone here should know, unless you are getting over on someone, the least you should pay for decent laptop is $500, but the amount of times I've had people in Best Buy whine that that's too expensive for them to just be using Office and small tasks is frequent. Google can make good products that are ready for primetime when they don't have their ass or in the clouds, but sadly as their messaging strategy has showed us, that's increasingly uncommon. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal. Roy https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fef4fa148cb6b5c2f15fcd856ec70e90ed88abb6606e0f6554b4d09654040535.png Max Johnson X-tra Bezel. Eric Marciniak Doesn't help that Best Buy has a giant iPhone 7 ad that literally blocks the pixel display from view right when you walk in haha. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8283702e9d03a34df4cfb2bd525ea593d0304d3937690392b7b3acc57eb7620e.jpg Berni Hargrove Best Buy is terrible with product placement. Shit literally changes every season if not more. Good luck finding anything remotely niche on your own. lol Jon E. Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. Berni Hargrove While I agree with a lot of what you said, some of your logic is flawed. Take america for example. There's over 150 million people here. It would take at least 15 million in sales here alone, just to see 1 in 10 people with it. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers. C Lo Good first article Trevor. Welcome aboard. Suyash Bansal I liked the article. 🙃 Orjuan Google Pixels customer service is great if you ask me. It takes like a week to get a replacement, not a month. Also, comparing it to the One Plus 3T is unfair, you didn't mention the superior processing and graphical power and the fact that it gets updates for the next 5-8 years. It also features Google Assistant, which is a big selling point. Add all those up and pixel is worth the extra 400. Plus, I got a regular pixel, with a two year protection plan, 128 GB, and it's still cheaper than iPhone. Google Pixel is a commercial and consumer success. Do your research before spouting out shit, all you did was look at the obvious facts and ignored the small stuff that counts. "UGHHHHH, it has a better camera and that's it.". RESEARCH YOUR TOPICS, Google Pixel is $400 more than One Plus 3T because it's better! Orjuan Plus, Nexus was barely Google at all, they just supplied the best version of Android while hiring an OEM to make the parts and design, while slapping their logo on it. Nexus was good, but not Google's essence, it was a startup for Pixel, which is 100% Google. AJZ16 couldn't care less* usamaisawake I had an entire column of pixels that were not working properly. Thing is my Pixel arrived in the first shipment and I had to leave the country so I didn't umbox it until 4 weeks later. When I called to let them know, they were curious why I waited so long and I explained I hadn't turned it on till just then. They didn't give me any trouble with it and exchanged it right away. They sent the new phone and then after I received it I shipped the old back to them. Perhaps this was still early in the release of the phone so they felt more obligated to make sure the experience was good. Phil Rowley My pixel bricked. I thought Google's customer service (along with bestbuy even though I paid for their stupid geek squad) were horrible. I hate to say it but Verizon was the most helpful and luckily I pay for their monthly insurance. Colin Richardson I miss the Nexus line.. Thankfully I can still buy some Nexus 5X phones (not refurbished). But that will not last. I have no idea what I will do for a phone after that.. I want a Stock Android phone, not a Stock Android Flagship phone. Max Johnson There are plenty of stock-like flagship and non-flagship Android phones. HTC, Sony, Moto and OnePlus are all stock based at varying prices. If you want direct update from Google and good customer service that's a different story, I think that's the main thing now, to get the same quality of support as Apple on Android. I'm surprised to get frequently updates from Sony with latest monthly security patches on my X Compact. Micah T "couldn't* care less." Think about it.... Tr3ple I bought a Pixel XL for 370 and I threw my Galaxy S7 edge in the drawer LMAO 😂 oh Happy day. Sammy Phillips 370 USD? or 370 Euro? Tr3ple USD, bought it 220 with a broken screen and fixed it for 150. So I spent 370. mtz Interesting article however, in the same way Microsoft is not really trying to sell the overpriced Surface Studio , Google is not trying to sell Pixels. Why? Simple. Goole has OEM partners that have supported the Android platform by providing the hardware from the beginning. While it one thing for Google to partner with a carrier each year and release a basic Nexus phone its an entirely different thing for them to release top tier Device and undercut thoes partners on price. Tony Bundy Replied via non-existent really blue Pixel. Yes, wasn't easy but here I am. 😀 Pixel.ization.alism Well precisely Google Blue would be #4285F4 not #4485ED if you would ask. Zuxs13 This was a rather poor opinion piece. You make claims like you can't "easily get a replacement pixel" which is completely untrue. The Apple store is hardly the only place that sells phones and offers good customer service. The OP3T might be readily available, but most consumers have no clue what it is or where to even buy one and would rather buy a phone that is sold at their service provider or local best buy and is supported by 24/hr support service. das "Couldn't care less" - if one *could* care less, than it currently cares. Lindsay Meyer I mentioned this in another thread but feel it probably merits its own post here, coming from the perspective of a disenchanted iPhone user who now owns a Pixel (and is still disenchanted). I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved the iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices) and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick, or worse, new packaging on the same lipstick (and their upgraded iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to hurl my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's kind of a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have more innovative features, but Apple with come right behind it and perfect those features. That's what they do now. Still glad I didn't get the iPhone 7; Apple didn't deserve my business, but Pixel has been a disappointment to me thus far. For the price, I'd prefer my husband's Nexus 6. I think he'd prefer his old HTC if it had front-facing speakers lol. I just don't feel there's a lot of good options out there right now that justify the cost. I have given serious thought to trying to find a replacement comparable to the old Sanyo 6100 (yes, that one) and then throwing an iPad or a tablet in my purse. Maybe even that old B&O phone would be fun. I'm just tired of my need for a smartphone to be continually exploited by these inferior products; half the time they break right after the warranty expires, and like an endentured servant, I'm forced into the process all over again. Also, the fact that this Pixel wants to track everything I do scares the bejeezus out of me. I'm sure Apple has done the same thing more covertly for years, but seeing everything I say, type, search, view, read.. not to mention every place I eat at, travel to or shop.. neatly organized into a little packaged profile makes me feel like a product more than ever. Eliminating Google's permissions to track this info also eliminates much of the Pixel's functionality as a smart phone with fluid communication between apps. I should have probably mentioned this first because I absolutely hate that aspect of it. Renee Looker I don't know about anyone else's opinion on the Pixel phone but I have the Pixel XL Blue and have had it since release. I've not had any issues with my phone, absolutely love it. Really quite eager to see what Google will be releasing next, the rumors are on the rise on what's up next. Nicholas Conrad Great article! techieland You and we are the customers when it come to the Pixel and Pixel Xl. And even the late and great Nexus products to some extent. Personally I think the Pixel phones were a fail, Google should have stuck to making reference level phones to ensure the manufacturers understand what the minimum an Android phone is supposed to be like. Samsung and OnePlus obviously gets it but it seems LG, HTC, & Motorola, are struggling despite all 3 being manufacturers of Nexus/AOSP devices. sgtguthrie *couldn't care less Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 142k 105k Latest Deals 2 [Deal Alert] Order an Amazon gift card valued at $25 or more through Alexa and get a $5 promo credit 2017/04/11 3:50pm PDTApr 11, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Verizon BlackBerry Priv for $259.99 on eBay 2017/04/11 12:35pm PDTApr 11, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Amazon's Gold Box deal has a SanDisk MicroSD 256GB for $120 and a 128GB dual USB-C/A drive for $39 2017/04/11 4:46am PDTApr 11, 2017 35 [Update: Added some more] Deal Alert: Here are some more temporarily free apps and games for your Sunday 2017/04/09 3:05pm PDTApr 9, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Gen LTE for $179.99 ($220 off) on eBay 2017/04/08 7:15pm PDTApr 8, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Download Protection and Tracking protection have their own separate pages. Contents 1 History 2 Prefs 3 Documentation 4 Engineering 4.1 Code walkthrough 5 QA 6 Telemetry 7 Links History Google Safe Browsing was an anti-phishing extension released by Google on labs.google.com in December 2005. Google has released this extension to the Mozilla Foundation under MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 in order that it might be used as part of Firefox if desired. We've landed this change on the trunk as a global extension as of 7 March 2006. You can read the discussion that lead up to to its integration in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=329292 Google started migrating their Safe Browsing to version 4 of the protocol in 2015. We are currently working on integrating V4 in our code base with a incremental approach. That is, we will be landing V4 patches progressively and leave the V2 stack up and running until the V4 is extensively tested and the Shavar server has been upgraded to V4. In other words, V2 and V4 will co-exist for a while to ensure we don't break Safe Browsing. See the V4 implementation plan for the milestones and bugs involved.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS Google Home now serves up Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews and WikiHow DIY tips Khari Johnson@kharijohnson April 11, 2017 11:27 AM Above: Google Home Image Credit: Google This past week was a busy one for Google Assistant. More than 20 new services were made available, including DIY tips from WikiHow, Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews, and an action that can act as a concierge for Airbnb guests. More than 170 actions have been listed in the Google Home app since the launch of the Actions on Google platform last December. The WikiHow action can tell you how to survive a bear attack in just 10 seconds, start a business (in about five minutes), administer CPR (in three minutes), or do the Heimlich maneuver (in a little over two minutes). The WikiHow action for Google Home begins by saying “Ask me to do anything,” but conversations with the action make it clear that it’s more accurate to say you can ask WikiHow about most things. Ask how to do Krav Maga and you may be told how to choose a martial art, for example. Regardless of whether WikiHow can tell you about anything or most things, this action can pull information from more than 180,000 WikiHow articles, and that’s powerful. Unlike most actions, WikiHow interactions are measured in minutes, not seconds. Longer answers are chopped up into sections and require you to say “Next” to proceed. Also among noteworthy new Google Assistant actions, the Rotten Tomatoes action can tell you a movie’s Rotten Tomatoes review, the year the movie was made, and a two to three-sentence review. This action only works today for movies. The Concierge Service action was made by Dana Young to support people who stay at his Washington mountain lodge. It’s meant to be a fun way for a guest to check in or to get their questions about house rules, the WiFi password, or the best way to contact the owner in an emergency answered. You can also share recommendations for nearby restaurants or places to go. The Concierge Service Alexa skill also made its debut days ago. Continuing a steady increase in public transit actions for Google Assistant, CharlieChat is a new action for commuters in the Boston area that tells you Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) train times for riders of the Blue, Orange, Red, and Green lines. Two new cooking actions emerged in the past week for cooking meals at home. They come just two weeks after Chefling launched its action for telling you about when food goes bad in your fridge. One new Anova action gives you voice control of the Anova Precision Cooker, a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connected device that regulates temperature and stirs hot water for evenly cooked food. The action can start, stop, or cook for a certain period of time. The Cook.ai action will ask you to open your mobile device, then gives you a code to enter at cook.ai to pair the Google Home and a device using a web browser. Like the experience of using men’s fashion action Able Style, this pairing brings you on a guided tour, but with recipe ideas. Once you begin, say yes and the assistant will email you ingredients and guide you through cooking the meal. When you’re ready to start cooking, just come back to the action and open as you always would. Upon return, the first thing the action will do is ask if you’re ready to cook the item you previously expressed interest in cooking. If you say no then the will guided tour through recipes ideas continues. New to the quote action category is The Keys, a series of quotes from DJ Khaled like “Those that weather the storm are truly the great ones” and “I remember when I ain’t have a jacuzzi.” There’s also a Daily Motivation action and the Steve Wynn Quotes action, inspired by Wynn Las Vegas hotel owner Steve Wynn. And days before the Masters last week the PGA released a PGA Tour Google Assistant action. When a tour event is taking place, the action can tell you about the leaderboard, as well as how a particular player is doing. The action can tell you at any time the standings for the PGA Championship, aka the FedEx Cup. Learn how AI can transform your business at the 2017 VB Summit, June 5th – 6th in Berkeley.

The move Tuesday came after the U.S. Department of Labor last week said it found a gender-pay gap at the Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -0.17% GOOGL, -0.22%  unit, which is a federal contractor, during a routine compliance probe. The department is suing Google to compel the company to disclose more compensation data for its investigation. Silicon Valley tech companies have been under increasing scrutiny for hiring more white men than women or people of color, along with their pay practices. Google said each year it suggests compensation based on an employee’s role, job level, location and performance ratings. Analysts who calculate what each employee should earn don’t have access to an employee’s gender, and an employee’s manager has limited discretion to adjust the suggested amount. An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.

Digital Trends Home > Web > We don’t pay women less, Google fires back… We don’t pay women less, Google fires back in response to Department of Labor findings Google's VP of People Operations authors blog post about firm's focus on pay equity By Lulu Chang — April 11, 2017 6:55 AM Share bennymarty/123RF Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Inequality in tech is no new subject, but Google is now at the center of an investigation suggesting systemic pay discrepancies between men and women. Google is none too pleased with a new report from the U.S. Department of Labor claiming the company displays “systemic compensation disparities.” On Friday, Janette Wipper, a regional director of the federal agency, said it found “compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce.” The findings come as part of a continuing investigation against the tech giant, which is accused of violating federal employment laws due to salary inequities between genders. The Silicon Valley company disputed the findings. A spokesperson told TechCrunch, “We vehemently disagree with Ms. Whipper’s claim. Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology.” And on Tuesday, Google’s vice president of people operations, Eileen Naughton, authored a blog post outlining the company’s focus on pay equity. Noting that Google publicly shared its top-level analysis of the pay gap (and how to combat it) in 2016, Naughton noted that the tech giant was “quite surprised when [the DoL] accused us of not compensating women fairly.” Writing that the assertion lacked “supporting data or methodology,” Naughton further argued that Google’s own annual analysis is “extremely scientific and robust,” and that its results have been entirely antithetical to those from the government agency. More: Black women in tech make 79 cents for every $1 a white man makes in the same job According to Google, the company reevaluates its employees compensation every year in a gender-blind manner, taking into consideration the role, job level, job location, and current and recent performance ratings. Then, Google uses its pay equity model to examine employees within the same job categories, and “analyzes their compensation to confirm that the adjusted amount shows no statistically significant differences between men’s and women’s compensation,” Naughton explained. The conclusion in 2016 was that there was no gender pay gay, Google said. “Nevertheless, if individual employees are concerned, or think there are unique factors at play, or want a more individualized assessment, we dive deeper and make any appropriate corrections.” Janet Herold, regional solicitor for the DoL, doesn’t seem convinced by the tech company’s denial. In an interview with the Guardian, she noted, “The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters … The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry.” Google has been embroiled in a legal battle with the DoL since January, in which the Department has asked the company to turn over job and salary history of employees. Google has refused to comply with these requests, however, and while a spokesperson said at the time that Google had provided “hundreds of thousands of records” to the government, it would appear that the DoL is not satisfied with the firm’s compliance. The legal battle is clearly far from over; on Friday, one of Google’s lawyers, Lisa Barnett Sween, called the DoL’s request for documentation unconstitutional, and a “fishing expedition that has absolutely no relevance to the compliance review.” Article updated on 04-11-2017 by Lulu Chang: Added news of Google’s latest blog post focusing on pay equity.

The move Tuesday came after the U.S. Department of Labor last week said it found a gender-pay gap at the Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -0.17% GOOGL, -0.22%  unit, which is a federal contractor, during a routine compliance probe. The department is suing Google to compel the company to disclose more compensation data for its investigation. Silicon Valley tech companies have been under increasing scrutiny for hiring more white men than women or people of color, along with their pay practices. Google said each year it suggests compensation based on an employee’s role, job level, location and performance ratings. Analysts who calculate what each employee should earn don’t have access to an employee’s gender, and an employee’s manager has limited discretion to adjust the suggested amount.

Digital Trends Home > Web > Tweaks to Google’s image search allow you to… Tweaks to Google’s image search allow you to buy items you see in photos By Jon Martindale — April 11, 2017 11:12 AM Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Finding handbags and sunglasses you like should be easier than ever, now that Google's image search finds products within images and links you to places where you can purchase them. Along with looking up pictures for creating the latest memes, you can now use Google image search to go shopping. In an update to image search, Google has created a “Similar Items” system for the mobile web and Android Search app. It finds products within images and links you to places where you can purchase them. Have you ever seen an image of a celebrity wearing something you’d like to purchase for yourself? Or spotted a cool accessory in a stock photo that you wouldn’t mind owning? Google’s Similar Items system is designed to make that acquisition much easier. It uses machine vision technology to identify products within photos and then link to them on retailer websites. While it’s certainly true that Google’s fancy image analytics algorithms are doing some of the legwork, Search Engine Land points out that Google also asks web developers to utilize metadata to help make the feature as fluid as it is. Without that, products may not be eligible for sale through the Similar Items system. More: Google’s updated Search app comes with Gboard, Google’s third-party keyboard Google has reportedly been encouraging the use of the metadata tags since December, though that could simply be because it wants to seed the web with compatible sites and products before sending the feature live. The feature doesn’t cover every kind of product out there just yet. As it stands, Google’s algorithm is able to pick up specific brands of sunglasses, handbags, and shoes, with the search giant promising that “other apparel and home and garden categories,” will be coming in the next few months. Google claims that some of the most common searches alongside brand-name products are pricing and availability, so creating a shortcut to a shopping experience is likely to be a profitable move for the company.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 134 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares270 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company. I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

Indian Yes we guessed him to be the new man by reading his name, Trevor "Newman" Marcie Mtz Good article...But it's "couldn't care less". chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine CF542 6 months? I replaced my S7E three times in four months for chronic and various problems before giving up and going Pixel blueman24 "Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES." "I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge" "Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months." You brought a $700 S7edge and not a $300 oneplus, so it should not be acceptable for it to become less responsive after 6 months? Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. WARLORD VIII On the up side the Pixel isn't catching on fire 😎 das I thought that was a feature for survivalists. :P Eric Works for me. The most stable software wise of any phone I've ever used. Paid 300 for mine and prefer it over the s7. Curved screens don't like screen protector. Nothing like water resistant on a phone that looks like a cat danced on it. Another huge plus is the lack of carrier spam. I'm not getting all the complaints. Google showed us we'd be getting if we choose to buy it. I for one have no regrets about doing so. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. Kristian Ivanov I'm not going to comment on the actual design, I want to hear thoughts comparing it to the undesputed legend - Nexus 5 (design only) JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. CF542 The only thing that the S7/S8 truly suffer from is having Samsung as a parent. They turned the phone (s) into a piece of bloatware full of crappy software that nobody wants. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Ryan Those are usability preferences. I will agree the settings are a freaking nightmare to find, but I dont go into settings often. Right now, and for over a year now, bluetooth audio has been straight-up broken. They implemented that absoloute volume BS without coding how to handle devices that dont send volume information, breaking it in my car. Then the idiots put developer setting that is to allow you to disable it but they didnt even test it and the user doesnt have permissions to change that setting, so the switch does nothing. That is a BIG bug, and one that Google has refused to address for over a year. Then there is the fact that my phone, and the first Nexus phone I have had to deal with this on, has to be rebooted every few weeks because it slows down horribly. Jack Smith Based on what? Had every iPhone since the 3G and relatively recently added Android as carry both and Android is excellent. So much is written is just simply not true. Suggest actually give recent Android a try and you might be surprised ;). Ryan Ive had android for coming up on 8 years, HTC Hero was the first, then one more HTC before going Nexus. Been on Nexus and still am with my 5x. I know, personally, some of the MAJOR shortcomings of Googles implementation of Android. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. ScratchC The problem with the Internet is how do I know you actually own one? Or are you just a troll. In any case, I unfortunately had to pass on the Pixel my S6 shit the bed and I had just upgraded to the S7. My gf tho.. I somehow convinced her to grab a Pixel on Verizon. She has not had not 1 issue. I'm not saying they don't exist. It's just not as bad as commenters trying to win an argument make it seem. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of the 22 Pixel photos had halos. None of the LG G6 photos had halos. whispy_snippet Wow. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. Vega007 My Pixel is, by far, the best phone I have ever had for battery life. Christopher Bement I'm only going with devices I've actually used, I haven't touched a Pixel personally. All I can say is it's day and night between the N6 and S7 on a given work day where I'm calling, texting and emailing almost constantly. Vega007 That's a good point, it all depends on what phone we have used to compare it to. I have never used a S7 Edge, but I have used a S7. While the battery life was fine, the Pixel does do better for my usage (I'm using the 5" btw). And that's the real key to battery issue is personal use. We all use our devices differently so battery life will always be subjective. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. ScratchC The iPhone has been in trouble for some time. It's why it started playing catch up (Forget current sales up to now. Poll after poll, iPhone users are bored of iPhones) Actually Google's Android is in trouble as well. Samsung is doing their own thing. Google needs to put it's foot down or compete. The Pixel is an attempt to do so. It's not perfect by any means. it's better than nothing and it was a solid first entry. If you simply don't like it.. Buy elsewhere. that's the beauty of Android. I think you guys forget, that out of our fanboy bubble, most people when they think of Android have a distinct definition. I'm talking the average consumer...they think Android = cheap phone from prepaid carrier that's slow, plastic, horrible camera & full of bugs. Or.. Android = Samsung Galaxy. Your average consumer still doesn't know what a Pixel is nvm that they don't even know what a Nexus was. Android phones need to be a premium product to compete. They need to charge the amount of money it takes for proper R&D.. Customer support etc. Google cannot sell at a loss and accomplish this. This very reason is why Samsung holds the Android crown. Regardless of your opinion towards their devices. Remember that Carrier subsidizing is how Galaxy devices sell by the millions. Iphones as well. Google is on the right path. They just need to bring the next Pixel to all carriers. Lindsay Meyer You're right. I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved those iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices), and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick (and their new iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to throw my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability, and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. mrjayviper Fairly new? How long have they been selling Nexus phones and other devices? MJ Let me get this straight... You left a comment without reading the whole discussion? I already very clearly laid out an actual argument but thanks for your input. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. madcanada That's correct, I'm pissed that Pixel gets a better camera software while Nexus is fundamentally the same in the department. I understand your point about camera being a combination of both hardware and software, but unlike, say, Apple, where each iteration is actually better in terms of hardware, and older iPhones still get whatever features they can physically run, Google decided to accentuate the difference by simply denying their last year phone the same updates. Where Apple only denies updates when the old phone can't actually handle them Google is simply abandoning their last year model to justify the price of the Pixel. whispy_snippet Except there's one key difference. Unlike iPhones that release each year, the Nexus 6P is not of the Pixel lineage. The Pixel is the first of its kind. madcanada That makes not a shred of difference in the argument I'm making. I find denying last year phone updates it perfectly capable of running, so you can justify the price of the new phone ethically questionable. I don't care if they rebranded, their decision to not give Nexus the updates it can handle is only guided by the fact that they wanted to charge twice the price for Pixel, and they couldn't have if Nexus got the goodies. whispy_snippet Ethically questionable? No, mate, it's business. Google's ultimate responsibility is maximising profits for shareholders. You're cranky that your 6P can't do what the more expensive a Pixel can do. Now imagine how Pixel owners would feel if they saw cheaper, older phones from the same company doing exactly the same thing as theirs. Again, I sympathise to an extent, but ultimately you get what you pay for. If you want the Pixel experience, buy it. madcanada I'm not cranky because my Nexus 6P can't do things Pixel can, on the contrary, I get full Pixel experience with free unlimited full size photo upload, Pixel launcher, Pixel camera, and day one Google Assistant on Nexus 6P. I'm cranky because I need to go to XDA to get them goodies. I understand it's business, but if you want to sell charge twice for the phone - sell a better phone, give us a better camera, bigger battery life, and don't downgrade our goddamn speakers. whispy_snippet Mate, you're simply not making sense anymore. You're effectively wanting something for nothing. You want Google to give you a Pixel quality camera experience on an older, less expensive phone from an entirely different lineage - for free. You're not entitled to free stuff. I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree. madcanada you can disagree all your want, i outlined my gripe with Google in the first post, then you decided to argue about the camera. New lineage or not, when you market Nexus as the phone that gets all the Google love, and then you just leave users behind right next generation simply to justify the price hike of new Pixel - that's low. Apple's feature fragmentation is driven solely by the hardware - newer phones get new exclusive features because older models can't do the same thing physically. Google is creating artificial fragmentation in order to justify twice the price. That's not the Google I remember and that's not the direction I like. Obviously it's their choice. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? Mix Sounds like you have not done this before because sending your phone to Google first, waiting for them to get it and look it over THEN sending a replacement is, 100%, the bad choice. Having them send you the phone first and put a hold on your creditcard is the better and faster choice! Complaining gets you nothing, USA got free daydream headsets, Canadians got nothing. The phone, after taxes, was $1,320.48 - close enough for me to complain about it at the $1,400 point, lol. John Doe OMG, YOU CAN'T READ? That is what I said Google does but you said you had to wait 7 days for your phone but they send you the phone first then you send yours in so no waiting. Yes I have done this before. With Apple, Google, and other companies...it is standard practice. No, they don't charge you taxes they just put a hold of the price of the phone not your total purchase price. Maybe it is just different in Canada...you should stop buying Google products there *rolls eyes* Lindsay Meyer If your damaged, soon-to-be-returned Pixel phone is broken and unusable, there would indeed be a waiting period to have a working phone in either case, because, being unable to easily switch your device at a physical brick and mortar store, you would be at the mercy of waiting for for Google's mailed replacement to have a working phone again. John Doe Google sens it next day here in the US Mix You straight up told me that I chose the bad option: "Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault." when I did not choose the bad option. If my phone bricked, which it did, and it takes 7 days for Googles phone to get to me I have no phone for 7 days, that is waiting without a phone! I think we are both right, 12 of this and a dozen of that, lol. <3 Stuff in Canada is more expensive and shipping generally sucks. I normally chose 2 day shipping with Amazon and get refunded shipping costs because the shipping companies miss the delivery date constantly. Nexus 4 and 5 have been sweet, my Pixel experience has been garbage. Their customer service has been good though so yay for that. Lindsay Meyer Canadian $ ≠ US $ John Doe Yeah but the phone still does not cost $1,400 in canada so yeah destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I'd far rather spend 5-10 minutes online from home getting my replacement shipped to me for free than having to go into a store, talk to someone who's less knowledgeable about my phone than I am, convince them to get it replaced, and then pay them an additional $35 to have them facilitate my phone then getting shipped to their store where I have to return to pick it up. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. Aaron Yeah, top notch. Tell that to all those iPhone 6plus users with the death screen disease and Apple does nothing... mrjayviper Out of warranty? I don't think Google supports out of warranty devices to donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. Berni Hargrove Hold on now, Chromebooks are more than good enough if you go price for price on a cheap laptop. There's no way that $200 Windows laptop with 2gigs of ram is performing on the same level as a $200 Chromebook with the same specs. In addition the reason why "Good Enough" applies to this is because the average person wants to pay very little for a computer, but have it be "fast and last a long time" to effectively browse and use Office. Anyone here should know, unless you are getting over on someone, the least you should pay for decent laptop is $500, but the amount of times I've had people in Best Buy whine that that's too expensive for them to just be using Office and small tasks is frequent. Google can make good products that are ready for primetime when they don't have their ass or in the clouds, but sadly as their messaging strategy has showed us, that's increasingly uncommon. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal. Roy https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fef4fa148cb6b5c2f15fcd856ec70e90ed88abb6606e0f6554b4d09654040535.png Max Johnson X-tra Bezel. Eric Marciniak Doesn't help that Best Buy has a giant iPhone 7 ad that literally blocks the pixel display from view right when you walk in haha. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8283702e9d03a34df4cfb2bd525ea593d0304d3937690392b7b3acc57eb7620e.jpg Berni Hargrove Best Buy is terrible with product placement. Shit literally changes every season if not more. Good luck finding anything remotely niche on your own. lol Jon E. Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. Berni Hargrove While I agree with a lot of what you said, some of your logic is flawed. Take america for example. There's over 150 million people here. It would take at least 15 million in sales here alone, just to see 1 in 10 people with it. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers. C Lo Good first article Trevor. Welcome aboard. Suyash Bansal I liked the article. 🙃 Orjuan Google Pixels customer service is great if you ask me. It takes like a week to get a replacement, not a month. Also, comparing it to the One Plus 3T is unfair, you didn't mention the superior processing and graphical power and the fact that it gets updates for the next 5-8 years. It also features Google Assistant, which is a big selling point. Add all those up and pixel is worth the extra 400. Plus, I got a regular pixel, with a two year protection plan, 128 GB, and it's still cheaper than iPhone. Google Pixel is a commercial and consumer success. Do your research before spouting out shit, all you did was look at the obvious facts and ignored the small stuff that counts. "UGHHHHH, it has a better camera and that's it.". RESEARCH YOUR TOPICS, Google Pixel is $400 more than One Plus 3T because it's better! Orjuan Plus, Nexus was barely Google at all, they just supplied the best version of Android while hiring an OEM to make the parts and design, while slapping their logo on it. Nexus was good, but not Google's essence, it was a startup for Pixel, which is 100% Google. AJZ16 couldn't care less* usamaisawake I had an entire column of pixels that were not working properly. Thing is my Pixel arrived in the first shipment and I had to leave the country so I didn't umbox it until 4 weeks later. When I called to let them know, they were curious why I waited so long and I explained I hadn't turned it on till just then. They didn't give me any trouble with it and exchanged it right away. They sent the new phone and then after I received it I shipped the old back to them. Perhaps this was still early in the release of the phone so they felt more obligated to make sure the experience was good. Phil Rowley My pixel bricked. I thought Google's customer service (along with bestbuy even though I paid for their stupid geek squad) were horrible. I hate to say it but Verizon was the most helpful and luckily I pay for their monthly insurance. Colin Richardson I miss the Nexus line.. Thankfully I can still buy some Nexus 5X phones (not refurbished). But that will not last. I have no idea what I will do for a phone after that.. I want a Stock Android phone, not a Stock Android Flagship phone. Max Johnson There are plenty of stock-like flagship and non-flagship Android phones. HTC, Sony, Moto and OnePlus are all stock based at varying prices. If you want direct update from Google and good customer service that's a different story, I think that's the main thing now, to get the same quality of support as Apple on Android. I'm surprised to get frequently updates from Sony with latest monthly security patches on my X Compact. Micah T "couldn't* care less." Think about it.... Tr3ple I bought a Pixel XL for 370 and I threw my Galaxy S7 edge in the drawer LMAO 😂 oh Happy day. Sammy Phillips 370 USD? or 370 Euro? Tr3ple USD, bought it 220 with a broken screen and fixed it for 150. So I spent 370. mtz Interesting article however, in the same way Microsoft is not really trying to sell the overpriced Surface Studio , Google is not trying to sell Pixels. Why? Simple. Goole has OEM partners that have supported the Android platform by providing the hardware from the beginning. While it one thing for Google to partner with a carrier each year and release a basic Nexus phone its an entirely different thing for them to release top tier Device and undercut thoes partners on price. Tony Bundy Replied via non-existent really blue Pixel. Yes, wasn't easy but here I am. 😀 Pixel.ization.alism Well precisely Google Blue would be #4285F4 not #4485ED if you would ask. Zuxs13 This was a rather poor opinion piece. You make claims like you can't "easily get a replacement pixel" which is completely untrue. The Apple store is hardly the only place that sells phones and offers good customer service. The OP3T might be readily available, but most consumers have no clue what it is or where to even buy one and would rather buy a phone that is sold at their service provider or local best buy and is supported by 24/hr support service. das "Couldn't care less" - if one *could* care less, than it currently cares. Lindsay Meyer I mentioned this in another thread but feel it probably merits its own post here, coming from the perspective of a disenchanted iPhone user who now owns a Pixel (and is still disenchanted). I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved the iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices) and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick, or worse, new packaging on the same lipstick (and their upgraded iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to hurl my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's kind of a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have more innovative features, but Apple with come right behind it and perfect those features. That's what they do now. Still glad I didn't get the iPhone 7; Apple didn't deserve my business, but Pixel has been a disappointment to me thus far. For the price, I'd prefer my husband's Nexus 6. I think he'd prefer his old HTC if it had front-facing speakers lol. I just don't feel there's a lot of good options out there right now that justify the cost. I have given serious thought to trying to find a replacement comparable to the old Sanyo 6100 (yes, that one) and then throwing an iPad or a tablet in my purse. Maybe even that old B&O phone would be fun. I'm just tired of my need for a smartphone to be continually exploited by these inferior products; half the time they break right after the warranty expires, and like an endentured servant, I'm forced into the process all over again. Also, the fact that this Pixel wants to track everything I do scares the bejeezus out of me. I'm sure Apple has done the same thing more covertly for years, but seeing everything I say, type, search, view, read.. not to mention every place I eat at, travel to or shop.. neatly organized into a little packaged profile makes me feel like a product more than ever. Eliminating Google's permissions to track this info also eliminates much of the Pixel's functionality as a smart phone with fluid communication between apps. I should have probably mentioned this first because I absolutely hate that aspect of it. Renee Looker I don't know about anyone else's opinion on the Pixel phone but I have the Pixel XL Blue and have had it since release. I've not had any issues with my phone, absolutely love it. Really quite eager to see what Google will be releasing next, the rumors are on the rise on what's up next. Nicholas Conrad Great article! techieland You and we are the customers when it come to the Pixel and Pixel Xl. And even the late and great Nexus products to some extent. Personally I think the Pixel phones were a fail, Google should have stuck to making reference level phones to ensure the manufacturers understand what the minimum an Android phone is supposed to be like. Samsung and OnePlus obviously gets it but it seems LG, HTC, & Motorola, are struggling despite all 3 being manufacturers of Nexus/AOSP devices. sgtguthrie *couldn't care less Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 142k 105k Latest Deals 2 [Deal Alert] Order an Amazon gift card valued at $25 or more through Alexa and get a $5 promo credit 2017/04/11 3:50pm PDTApr 11, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Verizon BlackBerry Priv for $259.99 on eBay 2017/04/11 12:35pm PDTApr 11, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Amazon's Gold Box deal has a SanDisk MicroSD 256GB for $120 and a 128GB dual USB-C/A drive for $39 2017/04/11 4:46am PDTApr 11, 2017 35 [Update: Added some more] Deal Alert: Here are some more temporarily free apps and games for your Sunday 2017/04/09 3:05pm PDTApr 9, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Gen LTE for $179.99 ($220 off) on eBay 2017/04/08 7:15pm PDTApr 8, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Don't Change Your Google Password Before Factory Resetting Your Android Phone - You Might Trip A 72-Hour Security Lockout David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2015/07/13 3:19pm PDTJul 13, 2015 641 Plus 1 on G+ 727 Share on Facebook 6 Share on Twitter Total Shares1374 Android OS Tips & Tutorials Article Contents 1 Why am I locked out of my phone for 72 hours? 2 Why is this a feature?

This isn't a news story, but more of a "public service announcement" about an Android feature not everyone may be aware of. If you've ended up here because your Android phone is telling you that, after a factory reset, you cannot log into your device for 72 hours (3 days), I don't have much good news: you're going to have to wait it out. If you want to know why exactly this happens, regardless of whether or not it has affected you, this post will at least show you how to avoid falling victim to this security measure again if you find it to be too much trouble, as well as why this feature exists to begin with. Why am I locked out of my phone for 72 hours? Back in March 2015, Google introduced a feature called Device Protection in its newly-released version of Android, 5.1 Lollipop. Part of this new suite of security tools was something called Factory Reset Protection. This is the source of the 72-hour device lockout. It is tripped by resetting your Google account password and then performing a factory reset on an Android device (with Device Protection, meaning it runs 5.1+) that account is connected to. This feature is designed to allow you time to regain control of your Google account in the event it is compromised because your phone was stolen. Think of it this way: if somebody changes the lock on a security door (your phone) the night before the building gets robbed, do you think the person changing the lock (or someone else at the lock company) might have been in on it? That's essentially the logic of factory reset protection. The idea is that your Google account and password are the "lock" and "key" that are required to open your Factory Reset Protection-enabled device (the door) after it undergoes a factory reset, and that by changing your Google account password, you're "tampering" with the lock right before you enter the door - which is suspicious. And so at that point, Google initiates a 72-hour hold on sign-ins to that "door." After that 72 hours expires, you still need to log in with the previously-connected Google account's password. The difference is that during the hold, you just can't log in at all - after the hold is over, you obviously still need to verify the account password. Why is this a feature? Isn't this insane overkill? The reason the hold is triggered is that, once your Google account is compromised on a stolen phone (easy enough to do - the thief has your Gmail and probably your phone number), there is essentially no other way to stop a thief from successfully erasing all traces of your account ever having been on said phone, since a wipe can be done directly from the recovery menu on bootup without any sort of authorization (PIN/pattern protected startup does not prevent this). That 72 hours theoretically gives you time to get your Google account back under your control and change the password again, making the thief's attempts to log in futile. If you're wondering why a thief would know your Google account password and not your PIN/pattern lock, that's actually more likely to happen than you might think: it's completely possible to reset your Google account password without knowing the current one if you've got somebody's smartphone. Two-factor authentication generally relies on SMS, so the thief would get the authenticator on your stolen phone, and you probably would also have your backup email account synced to that smartphone as well (which, hey, good personal security idea: don't put your backup account on your phone). Generally speaking, it is comparatively much, much harder to change the lock screen on a phone if you don't know the existing PIN, pattern, or password, and short of social engineering or plain luck, that's hard information to get. Is there any way around factory reset protection once it's triggered? Sadly, no. Once the protection system is tripped, you've got a functionally useless smartphone until that 3-day lockout expires. If you've been locked out of your device and are looking for a workaround, sorry: there isn't one that we're aware of. You're going to have to wait (you also cannot sign in to the phone using another account - this would kind of defeat the purpose of the feature). Those affected by this problem have confirmed Google support is of no help in the matter - they'll just tell you to wait out the timer, during which time your phone has all the utility of a paperweight. This suggests Google really has no control over the timer itself once it's been triggered, though we can't be sure. Can I disable this feature (Factory Reset Protection / Device Protection)? Nice try, phone thieves! But really, in the interest of full disclosure, yes - you can disable all Device Protection features (and it is an all-or-nothing switch), including Factory Reset Protection, and doing so is relatively quick and painless on supported devices. Here is the process. Enable developer options on your phone (Google it - it's easy, usually you just go into the settings, "about phone," find the build number (might be under software), and then tap it until it says "You are now a Developer!") Go to developer options and find "Enable OEM unlock." Check the box, and hit "enable." You will get a warning saying this will disable device protection features, and this includes factory reset protection. And I've tested it - factory reset protection no longer works with this checkbox enabled. If your device does not have an "allow OEM unlocking" option, that means one of two things. First, it most likely means it doesn't support factory reset protection to begin with, and that your phone is not protected in the event someone wipes it (or it may have a 3rd party solution!). Second, it could just mean the company that made your phone (or the carrier) decided not to include the OEM unlock toggle and is kind of a dick, and in that case, you only have one option, and it's a bad one (bottom of this section). As to what "allowing OEM unlocking" really does, it basically tells the system that the bootloader is authorized to be unlocked (note: not the same as actually unlocking it) and that Android won't stop you in the event you should attempt to do it. And yes, this makes your phone less secure, because it potentially means a thief could flash custom software to your phone, etc., and Google is politely saying it's not their problem if something bad happens when you do this. If you don't want to use the Enable OEM Unlock method or do not have such a toggle, the only other practical option to disable ADP is to run with an unsecured lock screen. Not very appealing, right? Android Device Protection requires that you have a PIN, pattern, or password for your lockscreen in order to function. Without those things, its features become useless anyway - accounts can be removed from the device without any additional authorization, and thus there's really no protection to begin with. How do I know if my phone has Factory Reset Protection? The easiest way is to just do a factory reset (while logged in to the device with a Google account and a screen PIN/pattern set) and see if you get the following dialog on startup. If you do, you've got factory reset protection. If you don't, you either don't have it or it's disabled. Device Protection should be on almost any Android device that shipped with Android 5.1 or higher out of the box. It will also work on some phones that shipped with some version of 5.0 (5.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2), such as the Galaxy S6, and were later updated to Android 5.1 or higher. Is there any warning about this when I factory reset my phone? Nope... which seems really bad on Google's part, if I'm honest. Devices should clearly state as part of the factory reset dialogue that they will be completely locked and rendered unusable if you've changed your Google password in the last 72 hours. Does this let phone thieves know how the system works? Certainly, but it still accomplishes the purpose (prevents a wipe), and it would be much better for end users. People have already encountered this feature unwittingly after resetting their Google account passwords, only to be locked out of their only phone for 3 days with absolutely no way to resolve the issue - and these people did nothing wrong. It's totally ridiculous that this is how it works, and Google should most definitely address it. So, the lesson? In the event you change your Google account password, you must wait three days before factory resetting any of your Android 5.1+ devices you use with that account unless you have explicitly disabled Android Device Protection on them. If you factory reset one of your Android devices before those 3 days are up and then attempt to sign into that device with your Google account, you will be met with an error message and not allowed to log into the device with any account until 72 hours after the password reset occurred, which is a major bummer.

IT Admin: "Why are these people still complaining that security settings are too low?" Sorry, power users. In case you've forgotten, Android is still the OS of the masses, and the masses prefer security over absolute account-level autonomy (thank that Wired editor). CoreRooted Honestly, I think Google is right about not lifting the 72 hour period on their end. We would be even more annoyed if all it took was a phone call to Google to unlock the device after it being stolen. If the thief has your device AND changed the password on it, then yes, they have your info. There isn't much that Google can do to say that the caller isn't you. I really can't see any of this as a negative. David Ruddock The lack of being informed that it will happen is the broken part. I agree a hard lockout is fine in theory, but not if you had zero idea it would happen in the first place unless you read an obscure support article. CoreRooted That's a good point (and then one thing in the article that I was shaking my head at). Google has never really been good at announcements, documentation, and marketing. I was trying to think of an instance where Google wouldn't want to let people know about this, but I really can't. It's something we WANT thieves to know about and users also. cpaixao The lock works not because changing password is suspicious, but because you might want to avoid thief from receiving emails at your logged account and browsing your personal data on apps with your account. Despite of that, you'll still able to lock and/or wipe your device with GDM from anywhere. This is the reason for GDP logic. bo ure Thanks for the acronyms, techie Genius. It renders your sentence meaningless unless we know wtf you're talking about or look them up. Bon Hey DAVID! Im not a theft i own a s6 edge plus i forgot my previous passowrd on my google accnt and may back up password in case my fingerprint will fail, now ive got 72hrs locked out. Its really heartbreaking. Is there any other way for me again to use my phone? Is it possible if i changed my password in my google accnt and used it after 72hrs locked out i can use already my s6 edge? Pls do help me. :( victoria atwood Hi can u tell me if I have this 72 hour thing..I turn my phone on it asks me for wiFi then asked me for google email and password .it tellseems me to sign in with owners account but I am the owner..I can't get on home screen or anything..I've only had my smsung edge 6 plus 2 days..Please help before I cracked up ..Thanks x David Navarro i have the same issue right now it tells me to sign in with owners account and Im using the same account can you tell me if your issue was fixed after 72 hours please. It doesn't say anything about 72 hours Shan Yousaf Hey i have the same issue yesterday. i have same error( please sign in with owners account) Kindly telll me is this issue will be resolved after 72 hours? TCH I just run into the issue today and there was no warning from google, what a shame. Oh well nothing to do now but wait those 72 stinking hours but lesson learned. Akshay I have a Moto G3, I first factory reset it in recovery mode, then changed the password from the phone. Now the phone is not allowing me to login, it returns password error with old password, but accepts new password, but after checking the new password it returns the same verification screen. Currently going through 72-hours lockout and tried many times with new password. So, after the 3 days are over, will I be able to login in my moto g3 with new password? Moirrainefortruth Well, there should be a way to go around it if you send a code from your own darn email. Google doesn't get security, they just pretend they do. Shane Johnson Honestly the phone states this when you initially setbup your first gmail with the phone. The people whobare affected by this and “surprised" are peoplr who SKIP through the set up screens. So shame on them bo ure Oh, F.U., it's impossible to read every g.d. little thing this miserable phone throws at you. EowynCarter That. No point in a security measure that can be bypassed. Though a warning would be nice indead. I finally let my bootloader unlocked. Not safe, but I'm afraid that it might prevent me from fixing my own phone in case of bootloop. Don I disagree. I'm in this situation right now. My brother sold me his phone and I asked him for his login to unlock it, but before that I decided to factory reset it to clear it. Unbeknownst to me, he was resetting his password at the same time. Now I'm toast. mfr118 Just so everyone knows I'm the reason for this PSA. Thanks Artem and David for all your help the other day. CoreRooted Ugh... sorry that hit you. 3 days without my DD would drive me insane. mfr118 Insane wouldn't be the word I'd use. I was stuck using my companies iPhone for 3 days. I wanted to eat a bullet Artem Russakovskii You and https://plus.google.com/u/0/+ChadCooper/posts/i2F9N1mjoVG https://plus.google.com/u/0/+ChadCooper/posts/Py5rkHYUZry mfr118 Well thanks again for the help the other day. You guys actually take the time to help unlike those other "Central" Android sites Guest Why would anyone mess with my Google account if they stole my phone? I'm not sure if I understand this feature. David Ruddock You can't wipe the phone to the point of it being resellable without that password - Factory Reset Protection requires it to be verified on boot after a factory reset, and Android won't fully start until the password of the last account on the device is verified. Tl;dr - if you don't have the Google account password (or get locked out after trying to change it), you can't resell the phone. Guest Oh I didn't know that, thanks for explaining. Can't you just log out of the original owner's account and delete the data of Play services, etc. before trying to do a factory reset? David Ruddock That requires the device PIN / pattern / password from the lockscreen, which must be set up for these features to turn on in the first place. GryphKid44 How can a thief change your password without being able to get past the lockscreen? It seems they would have to change your password from a different device which means that they have access to another device as well. David Ruddock It would be unlikely, but entirely possible if they steal your phone while it's not locked (eg BT smart lock, long lock timeout, etc.) nehpets In this instance where somebody has your phone unlocked already, what is preventing them from just enabling the OEM Unlock for their own use? I don't remember the developer options requiring pin/password, etc. EowynCarter Nothing. That's the reason smart lock can be used after I set my work account on my phone.Not safe. All about security vs convenient nehpets So that makes this 72 hour lockout period worthless. It will catch a whole lot of people doing nothing wrong, while anybody who nefariously reset somebody else's password using their stolen cell phone would also take 2 seconds to enable the OEM unlock and not have any issues. Brad You need the pin to turn it off whether or not the phone is "smart" unlocked... so they can't disable it. nehpets That makes a whole lot more sense. Prezes Dyrektor what about flashing a different rom? perhaps even an older version stock? wouldn't that work around this protection? EowynCarter Only if the bootloader in unlocked. And as default, you have to allow the unlock in the developers settings. Or fastboot oem unlock says access denied. Dabu So what am I supposed to do, if I'm selling a phone with this feature? CoreRooted Probably wipe the device first and then change your password afterward would be safer. Walker86 Actually that may not help in all cases. I just got hit with this because of a glitch on my Samsung Galaxy S6 where it suddenly failed to read my fingerprint and asked for my backup password, which it didn't recognize either. T-Mobile suggested a factory wipe to recover the phone, but it wouldn't recognize my google account afterwards. So, they passed me on to Samsung support who suggested I change my google account password to see if that would help - and bang here I am for 72 hours. Whatever the intention, this is a poorly thought out implementation of the concept. There should be a way to validate legitimate owners and bypass this lockout. Tardaboveme Turn off the lockscreen, then remove the google account from the phone. That should let you wipe it without it coming up after the fdr. David Ruddock Correct. ALUOp You don't change your password when you sell your phone, so you don't need to worry about this feature. Just wipe the phone. Despite the length of this article, it doesn't explain things very clearly. Cory S read more. http://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/nexus2cee_Screenshot_2015-03-12-16-48-37_thumb.png ALUOp I don't understand your point. I was telling Dabu that he needs not worry about the 72-hour thing, which this article is trying to explain and apparently got him confused. Cory S When you wipe your phone you need to sign back in with the original account to unlock it.. That part has nothing to do with password changes.. ALUOp Where in my previous comments did I say or imply signing in after wipe has anything to do with password changes? Please read or re-read my previous comments. All I said is Dabu doesn't need to worry about the 72-hour blackout this article is trying to explain. Cory S He asked what he needed to do when he sold a phone with this feature...which disabels a device after a factory reset until the original owner signs back in. He was given the correct answer above, yours would had resulted in a new owner opening up a paper weight. Demetria Streeter thats what mine is saying right now ToniLKerns ====Lates Quality performance androidpolice ...... <**** Find Here Trooper311 Happened to me about a month or so ago. I contacted Google and was told there was no way around it, even though I pressed the issue. Lesson learned the hard way. After 72 hours was up, I was able to log back in. mciuccio Hey, I just did the same thing, I changed my google password, because of a blackshades hack on my work PC. and also in trying to clean up my Note 5 I did a factory reset on it also. I have tried to log back into my Note 5 every day, I also have 2 step verification turned on now with my google account. So currently my sim card is in an iPhone 5 I suppose for three days from now, after reading this article. I am just wondering will I have to try to log in with my new google password or my old one I changes? Does anyone know? Jey New one Bunklung There was another Android Police article on Factory Reset Protection and someone posted a comment indicated that even with an unlocked bootloader and allow OEM unclocking that factory reset protection still worked even when reflashing the device to stock. The account check/FRP happens server side. http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/03/12/guide-what-is-android-5-1s-antitheft-device-protection-feature-and-how-do-i-use-it/#comment-1903978565 I think this complicates resale too. If the seller doesn't remove FRP (pin/password/pattern) and factory resets the phone and throws it in a mail, that's a sad day for the buyer. I wonder if Swappa will disclaim this. There are a few comments about unintended resale consequences: http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/03/12/guide-what-is-android-5-1s-antitheft-device-protection-feature-and-how-do-i-use-it/#comment-1982676882 Normally a seller and a buyer are always aware of the ESM/MEID status, but now the big question will be, "Is FRP disabled and the phone reset to factory???", in each listing right next to ESN status. TylerChappell This article helps make all the theives better theives. ;D Their only requirement now is to pick out a person they think would be too lazy or incompetent to regain control of their account within 3 days. Brad You can't fix stupid. TylerChappell Lol right you are, sir! João Victor Schiavo I liked the article a lot, but I got confused at some parts. I read it again and again, and now the only part I didn't get very well is this: "Two-factor authentication generally relies on SMS, so the thief would get the authenticator on your stolen phone, and you probably would also have your backup email account synced to that smartphone as well" Could anyone explain me this? Thank you. :) lamenting Let's say your backup email account was a Yahoo account. You might have the Yahoo Mail app on that same phone. So if you change your password on your Google account to block the thief, the thief could request Google to send the login reset email to your backup email account - your Yahoo account - and compromise your Google account. So don't put your backup email account on your phone. :) João Victor Schiavo But if my phone has a PIN, he can't see the email received, right? Also, what about the first part, before the last comma? That's what I didn't understand. PS: I don't use a backup email for my main account. :P blindexecutioner Your phone is the authenticator. João Victor Schiavo But how? You mean my phone number? But he wouldn't be able to see the message my phone receives, be it by email or by sms. CoreRooted That isn't necessarily true. Lollipop allows you to have your notifications displayed on your lockscreen... EVEN if you have it locked with a pin, password or pattern. The contents are still there. So, yes, a thief COULD see the SMS code or the code in the email (depending on client and such). It is possible. Internet Guardian Good article!! Now can someone please let me the know the best way to Reset/Format a device Android 5.1 device before selling it? Alexander Sofinskiy Yeah! I am looking for that too, how to reset your phone before selling? and how to not get locked with used devices which I bought from somebody?? yankeesusa There was a cnet article on this. here is a quick way, first things first, don't reset until you activate encryption. Then after you encrypt the phone, factory reset. This should be good for most people. If you want to go even further, then after factory reset, go back in the phone and add a bunch of fake info, then factory reset again. Do this several times if you want. After all this, remember to unencrypt phone. Of course some phones will not let you hard reset unless you decrypt. I think the g3 does this. Ali Mahdavi Thank you Android Police, it was really useful! blindexecutioner Thanks. I very well could have done this around the time a new version of Android drops. CoreRooted Nope. In fact, if you are selling the device, you should just wipe it (I do this about 5 times just to be sure) and then DON'T log back into it. Change your password for the account the device was previously setup with after you wipe it (the changing of it before the wipe is what triggers FRP) and you should be good. sugarwer765 Power Read police article < w­­­w­­­w.­­­­N­e­t­C­a­s­h­­­9­­.­­­C­­­o­­­m Peter Siegmund I don't have the "allow OEM unlocking" on my Nexus 4 (with Android 5.1.1). Where can I find this in the developer options? EowynCarter Not there on my nexus 4 either. Erroneus I believe Nexus 4 doesn't have the necessary hardware to support the needed encryption, which is why this feature is not present. Nexus 4 owner here my self. Arpan Malviya Not on my N5 either Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson You can't. Nexus 4 and 5 don't have that option cabbieBot Did this one get rushed out the door or was it intended to just address stock users? Because that's the only way it makes sense. Those of us who want SU and have our bootloaders unlocked are still out here, ya know. So, some questions. 1) Factory Reset. Let's get that defined. I take it that the article primarily addresses the aftermath of what happens when you choose the option in the "Backup & Reset" submenu in Settings, and selecting the choice for a Factory Data Reset at the bottom, below all the "please generate a hash of my soul's identity and back it up please" options. * But, that's still not clear. There is also this line: "since a wipe can be done directly from the recovery menu on bootup." What recovery? Stock recovery? What if I have CWM or TWRP as a custom recovery, does it trip it? And goodness, how would it if I factory reset using a custom recovery? What If I just dirty flash a ROM update when I've changed a password to an account on the phone? Or do a wipe of any/all partitions from a custom recovery, flash a brand new ROM, and reboot? Or restore a nandroid? What is phoning home? 2) This occurs for any google account the phone is locked into? So, if I have a secondary (or tertiary, even!) google account logged into my phone, this applies there too? 3) I have an LG G3 and the recent firmware update (ZVA) was to backport this feature to the current android version we are on (5.0.1). There is no OEM Unlocking option menu, either, but the article says there are only two cases when that will happen. Can we expect similar behavior? CoreRooted To answer #1 (from what I understand from the support docs: https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6172890?hl=en), it isn't the action of wiping that is the trigger. It's the setup AFTER the wipe. The recovery type (stock, CWM, TWRP, etc) shouldn't matter. When you go into setup (and enter in the network info), the device contacts Google to determine if it is participating in the Factory Reset Protection (easy enough to do as Google keeps a UUID of every device that has Android installed running 5.x+)). Most likely the trigger is that something has changed on the /data or /system partitions (maybe even lower level than that) and that is what triggers the lock. As for #2, it applies to the device. So, if you signed in with [email protected] , change the password and then factory reset, ANY ACCOUNT will be locked out of that device. You can still use your account on other devices (and with the web), but not on THAT device. The device, at this point, can ONLY be unlocked with your account and new password. For a thief, they essentially have a brick in their possession. So, even if you have [email protected] , you still won't be able to sign into THAT device. #3) Unknown at this point. I also have a G3 and I haven't changed my password in about 40 days. I don't really WANT to test it, but I'm willing to bet that LG made it so that we cannot turn off the FRP at all. yankeesusa This is a great feature to have. But there should be a warning on phones and online letting you know that their is a possibility of a 72hour lockout. Other than that I'm glad they are doing this. CoreRooted There's a support article... Buried deep within Google's docs for the Nexus line. lol... https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6172890?hl=en yankeesusa I'll take a part time job just to read the docs LOL. They should post a warning on the phone itself though. Maybe with enough complaints they will. Blackangel3942 I can think of one reason why they do not post a clear warning: and that is so that it can catch the potential thief off-guard, and apparently it works as it caught David and many others off-gaurd. DanSan Good information here, thanks guys. I use 2 factor authentication but dont use SMS as a way to get codes. I have a set of printed codes i keep locked at home and use the google authenticator app on my devices. it is also password protected separately inside the phone. dont have my recovery email on that phone either, didnt even think of that before. DanSan If you didn't know about the 3 day lock out prior to doing a wipe I can completely understand that and I feel for people. On the other hand, to complain about Google not being able to reset it is very different. its like yelling at your bank for asking you security questions when you try to call them up and access your account. its protecting you for a reason and if that security is simply compromised with a simple phone call there is no reason for having it in the first place. Maybe they could add something to clear the hold once you're back into your account but im not sure if that would put any holes in this defense or not. either enforce it all the time or never, thats how security works. DanSan im still very curious about the effects of having unlocked bootloader. I originally unlocked the bootloader of my nexus 6 when it was on 5.0 and updated it manually to 5.1.1. its still unlocked but the oem unlocking toggle is not turned on. if i try to turn it on im greeted with the pin screen and a warning telling me it wont work anymore. have we 100% confirmed this? im already bootloader unlocked so i dont really care but curious how it could effect locking/unlocked bootloaders. CoreRooted It shouldn't affect the bootloader at all. With FRP enabled, you can wipe the device 100 times and the result will still be the same. It's the setup (the phone home to Google) after reboot that determines if you are locked out or not. dannyR Google implements tight security (or tight anything) only when it doesn't affect them financially. You're scrued for 3 days? Tough beans. Aris Routis The fact you're not warned,is the right thing to do. It would defeat the purpose of having such a mechanism in place if you were to announce it in the first place. Murilo Antas Pereira Happened to me on a 3rd gen moto g. Even with no security set on lockscreen. Cindy Craig I changed my Google password, did a factory reset on my phone and ended up here. Now, once the 72 hour lockout is over, do I enter my old password or new Google password into my phone to activate it again? I am unclear...and would appreciate any help Mahak Bansal Same Situation....What to do?///// WHAT WAS THE SOLUTION?????? Cindy Craig The only solution is to wait the full 72 hours, then enter your new google password into your phone. Then, it will work normally. In the meantime, I put my SIM card into an old phone that I had while I waited. rayan tahir i have changed my google password after factory reset from recovery mode. I cannot open frp lock what can I do now? pntless I just got nailed by this. Maybe do a reminder post since Marshmallow images just pushed? Jerry What a nightmare..... Google blames Samsung, Samsung blames Google, Sprint throws their hands up in the air and points to both Samsung and Google. Legitimate owners are caught in this finger pointing exercise and quoted company policy and we have to wait 72 hours. Insane. bo ure Quite. Jerry So can anyone tell me about FRP Unlock applications that are being offered in other forums? Pramit Bhattacharyya I changed my gmail account password last night.After that I had a hard reset on my mobile device but I stuck in the sign in loop.It shows ''this device was reset.To continue sign in with th e google account that was previously synced on this device.'' What to do? Should I wait 72 hours.After that can this device will open by putting my new gmail password? Mahak Bansal same dude....STUCKED HELP GUYZZZ DANIEL S wait 72 hrs!!! pcnexus http://www.pcnexus.net/2015/12/what-is-factory-reset-protection-google-72-hour-lockout-android-lollipop.html Eric Paroissien Excellent article and helpful. Mel I just bought my Son a Droid Turbo for his Birthday like 2 weeks ago. He is 14 and forgetful so he has locked himself out of his phone and can't remember his gmail email or password. I understand the wait 72 hour thing but when I called Motorola they said after 72 hours it would give me the option to make a new google email and get in that way. After reading these comments I am thinking the guy at Motorola is wrong. Also if that is the case his phone is unusable so money down the drain. Am I correct? Verizon is our carrier and they suggested I call Motorola. ryan have you heard anythiing back? Jonathan Hawkins I was locked out of my Samsung Galaxy phone but did find a company called RockIT Repairs that can remove the Factory Reset Protection from any Android phone. They charged me $50 to do the FRP removal. This is the link for their removal service http://rockitrepairs.com/frp-factory-reset-protection-removal/ . I hope this help someone like it did me after being locked out of my phone. GabbyGibby This happened to me when I took my new galaxy 5 note to the ATT store because my bluetooth was not working in my car well they had to do a hard reboot I forgot my password for google she said no problem will just change your password Here I am on the third day of my lock out Thank You AT&T. After calling her supervisor because we couldn't get into my phone she apologized and said sorry there is a 72 hour lock I didn't know about this. Well we know now don't we. Thank you for this article I loved it and I'm passing it on for other people so they don't have to go through this. Will This is completely ridiculous and absurd. Ok, i can understand the need fit ask the security, I'm up for all that. What really gets me riled up is that Google does not inform is users of the update and even are you have been locked out, you still don't know why, or for how long and not only that, here i am on the phone with my service provider trying to figure out how to get accesd to my phone and all but still, nothing. I cant even finish setting up my phone, or even skip the google account set up and just be able to at least use my phone period. After getting my replacement phone two days ago, my finger scanner was failing to work, had forgotten my new backup password, it wouldn't log me on with my google account, thought THAT password might be wrong so I changed it. That was not working so i got on the phone with my service provider and street about half an hour end up having to do a hard rest on my phone. So evening stated up just fine, but then i get that screen saying the phone was reset, to use account that was previously synced on device, goes to next scrern, let's me ounch in password, then back to 'VERIFY YOUR ACCOUNT' and stuck in a never ending loop. If you are locked out at least tell me I'm locked out and for how long, instead of making me loop in the hopes i might have puncged in my password wrong or m7spelled my account email, but it just asks yo enter the information. So it took another hour long phonecall with my service provider, which ended up in another factory reset, and after tech support did some digging, found this article informing me about this. Now I'm stuck unable to use phone. There has to be something Google can do about this, I'm sure they wouldnt write a program without being able to bypass it and letting you acces your stuff sgai. What if there was an emergency or something? Im sure that if your phone was stolen, you'd report it, and get on a computer and wiped thee stolen veice remotely or locked it or something. When i lost my phone once, i immediately got online locked it, and not being able to find it, erased it, called my service provider and had service stopped on phone so as to not allow anyone else use or access to my i formation. Obiously Google does have a way to verify that it's you and not someone else trying to get accesd to your device or even your acvount, with so many security measures in place. Has Google received enough complaints about this? Enough to make some kind of change? pcnexus The 72-hour lockout is by default active. So, if you do a factory reset in recovery mode, you still won't be able to login and verify device ownership for the first 72-hours. I didn't change the password after factory reset and the device is now not allowing me to login and verify. Waiting for 3 days to pass, previously unlocked the phone after 3 days. RE Casper Here is another fun point [sarc]... I ran into this problem myself, waited the 72hrs and after I still couldn't get back in, I contacted Google Customer Service. The answer I got... "Call Motorola about getting the phone replaced".... Now, here I sit, $600+ paperweight of a phone in hand. So, moral of the story... it's not just getting locked you should be worried about with this "new security feature". You may just end up with an inaccessible device and far more than 3 days of having no phone, like I have. pcnexus You can unlock the phone. Read this tutorial. I have unlocked the phone 2-3 times after FRP is initiated. http://www.pcnexus.net/2015/12/what-is-factory-reset-protection-google-72-hour-lockout-android-lollipop.html Peter Goodstadt Thanks for that info it worked a treat to reset my one plus for reselling.Peter G Nony I hate this feature more than anything. Im always changing my password to my gmail, and i have a really insecure boyfriend who always tries to put spyware on my phone, so im always resetting it. I dont know how many times I've been locked out of my phone in emergency situations because of this. I NEVER HAVE A WORKING PHONE!!!. It makes me want to switch to Apple. I am so over Android because of this feature!!! Stephen Can I ask someone on this blog to answer a question I have regarding my Moto e. I'm an old guy, 64, not a techie like you folk are. I do not text. Fingers too fat, eyes too bad. I don't want to email anyone or anyone to email me via my phone. I have an email account on Gmail for that. Why does my phone keep noticing me that I need to enter the correct password for ????? It says it 'Couldn't sign in'. I don't know if I want or need it to do so. Any idea as to why I should provide my email password? I understand it was set up by my son an IT guy but I change my password every 6 months or so and after changing it this last time, I started getting this request. Thanks much Sajeev Pattath Thanks for info. I am facing the same problem for my moto g3. it auto updated to android 6 and there is some issues. No incoming calls are getting on phone . Then i changed password and done factory reset. after seeing this at least i am happy that i may able to use my phone after 72hrs Lead Poisoner Didi it work after 72 hours? Chris Lee After the 72 hour wait period, am I going to use the password that I changed it to? or do I need to know the original one which I prob don't know pcnexus Please read this article to completely get out of this lockout. http://www.pcnexus.net/2015/12/what-is-factory-reset-protection-google-72-hour-lockout-android-lollipop.html Jey Use the new password Lead Poisoner Is it stiĺ 72 hours? Just happenned to my phone sony xperia z3 plus Dickie Whiteside BOOM! Fix for Factory Reset Protection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuPIhiFZoaI DJ Anderson Honestly, no system is full proof. Thieves will be thieves and I do feel this is overkill. If you don't, this obviously hasn't happened to you yet. This just happened to me without any warning from the system whatsoever. I feel a lawsuit brewing if Google doesn't fix this one size fits all approach to phone thievery. Furthermore, I can't for the life of me figure out why it can't just use your thumb print scan to bypass the lock. Obviously if my thumb is there, it's me. Which brings me back to my point - no system is full proof, and this one is flawed big time. ZULUWA GO TO HELL GOOGLE WITH YOUR FREAKIN ARTIFICIEL INTELLEGENT STUPIDITY. I did a factory reset, I erase the all phone data. I was going crazy.. Even I erase media data. F**** Y plug-Ugly arsemongers. And Thank you Folks with you precious clarification, yesterday I was unable to sleep until morning and I was about throwing the phone on the wall, Appreciate you post. Uzer Account Does it matter if my phone is on or off? Should i turn it on/off in 3 days for it to unlock? Frank Markovich I changed my password to ensure there would be zero issues when I reset my phone....fuck me running. Esther McGough I like the protection, but I hate that no one knew this until I researched it, I could have bought a new phone last Thursday, had my phone number put on it and got my account straightened out then had to wait the three days, instead i was frustrated until today when I did just that, so to get into my phone i still have ANOTHER three days , get this information out to people who sell your phones Randy Deaton Just to add to the discussion but I just bought a used phone and the previous owner factory reset it before sending it...now I have a phone that I literally cannot use because of this feature! If I ever try to log in it wants the "previous" account and I do not have the previous owners information! In my scenario this feature is pretty dumb! Denys Kravchenko Nexus 5x, Android 6.0.1 - not 72, 24 hours now :-) Lead Poisoner I hope its true i need it for my job hrzn well I just got f'd by this on my s7, the damn thing randomly stopped recognizing my finger print after months of it working, I had 2 attempts left, I decided to shut the phone off and turn it back on knowing when I do that it instead asks for me to input a password, which I've done a few other times when restarting my phone, but I guess I forgot the exact password, so both attempts struck out, it shut off, reset, apparently stated it would delete everything now it wants my google account, no problem... except I had my google password set to be remembered on everything, so I haven't actually put that in for several months, I forgot that too, it says "forgot password?" I clicked that, reset it, now it just loops back to putting google account info in again. I can't get past it, is this the 72 hour thing you mention, now I have to wait that long? This is ridiculous. Waste of $700, and I'm gonna be f'ing pissed if my baby daughters photos were deleted. Marcus Silva Almost got locked out, luckily I had 2 accounts guest23 You sir saved me! I was sitting up sulking and whining because I was locked out but I have two accounts! I thank you and my daughter thanks you lol tffk I'm locked out of my brand new OnePlus 3 because of this bullshit. It would have been nice to be warned first! Varun Menon Same. Locked out of my oneplus3. Have a couple of questions, after the 72 hour period, should i factory reset the phone again and then log in with my new pass or not factory reset and just log in? Angelo When does the 72 hour timer start??? Jesus. The most basic question and you never answered it! Is it 72 hours after performing the reset OR 72 hours after changing your password! bo ure Apparently, after changing your password. Mostly likely because IT TOLD YOU TO when you tried to sign back in. (I'll bet $100.00 you entered your email and password, both new and old a million times trying to get your legal phone back in use. Man, I hate Google with the heat of a thousand suns.) Kayla P-P I don't know if anyone is still monitoring these comments, but I have a related problem. I have a brand new S6 edge. My son was telling me I needed security on my phone, so we were trying to set up the fingerprint scanner. The scanner would NOT read my fingerprint, so we did NOT set up a backup password, and I NEVER enabled the fingerprint security. I did set up a four digit pin for the swipe screen. A day later I REMOVED the swipe screen pin because I was trying to move stuff to my phone via USB and I had to keep typing in the PIN. When I removed it, the phone did NOT ask me for my fingerprint or pin. The same day, I updated to 6.0.1. Then, I tried to go back and put a PIN on the swipe screen (which, after the update, I did not have anymore! When I wake up the phone it goes directly to the home screen). I cannot even ADD security to my phone because it is asking me for my fingerprint (which the scanner never took) or backup password (which I never set). I am resigned to a factory reset, but am worried about the Google lockout. In anticipation of the reset, I removed 2 factor authentication from my Google account. Will THAT start the 72 hour clock, like resetting the password would? I am not locked out of my phone, so I can use it...just wondering if I need to wait a few more days before attempting the reset. I have read that a lot of people have problems with getting back into their phone after reset with Google...I don't know if that's just because so many people have changed their password, or if there is a glitch with the phone software. That worries me more than the factory reset itself! In my googling about this problem, I found this too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McQbcCHN3b0 Andreas Hello, very good article. But I want to tell you now, I had reset my mobile phone, I was waiting 3 days, I had put my details, and didn't work, then I had changed my google account password, and I was trying again, it didn't work, I was called Google Support, they had told me to wait 72 hours and to try again. I was waiting 4 days today, I was trying again, and I can't log in. What should I do?! ([email protected] ) Simone Ramella Thanks for the useful information. I only wish I read this post two hours ago, before factory resetting my wife’s Motorola Moto G as suggested by our phone company (she has been unable to receive any call in the last few days and they were unable to give us any help). Of course, she did not remember her Google account password, therefore I had to change it right before factory resetting the phone. Now I found out that for at least 72 hours (why not a couple of months?!) she won’t be able to use her mobile phone at all. Which is not really a joke if you don’t have a spare one to replace it (we don’t) and need it for your work and/or to keep in touch with your children, and not just to play Pokemon Go. It seems Google cares a lot about our security, but doesn’t care at all about warning its users that they may be locked out for at least three days from their own phones if they dare to change their Google account password. They can call it “security”, for me it’s just total nonsense. PANDAMONIUM🚀 God damn it, now if only I had known this 20 minutes ago. Also, I read that the lockout is for 24 hour snow, instead of 72, is this correct? bo ure I HATE this phone more than anything I've ever purchased. Samsung Galaxy S6 through Sprint. It's been hours and hours and hours and hours and untold piled up hours of straight up heartache, grief, and pure aggravation, reading and researching, and so precious little use. WORST purchase of my entire life. And now I'm not even having the service I pay a fortune for each month. And now it will undoubtedly cost more $ to pay somebody to bypass. And this is what happens when three giant corporations are all involved in a matter so simple as a phone. And I thought Apple was obnoxious. The 3-way marriage between Google, Samsung and Sprint beat them by a mile. Never again. When my contract is up, this is the last. Heba Reda Attar I have a question.. when the 72 hours are finished, and i try to log in again with my new password it will log me in? or i have to log in with my old passwords? Alexander Baron Just for the record, I think this article should clarify that the phone is now only locked for a 24-hour period. I recently spoke with a Google Support representative after my phone was locked Nuala Ronan yes, the notification on my oneplus 3 is 24 hours. i wish we could authenticate another way similar to banking recovery. even 24 hours is ridiculous Kyrstol Dinger Do you have a phone number for google support? I have been doing this dance with the 24-hour wait even though my password hasnt been changed for the last 4 days!!! Cara Huggett Seriously, where can I address a complaint letter? I was forced to factory reset my s7 because it kept freezing and shutting off on its own. In the process of setting my phone back up I had to sign into my gmail. Well the the problem is that I have been signed into my gmail account automatically on my phone for over a year and I don't remember my password. I had to reset my gmail password online so I can sign in and set my phone back up. Now I am locked out for trying to set my phone back up? Brilliant really! There must be a better option than this. CT So if my phone keeps saying verify your account I have to wait 72 hours and then what?? Nuala Ronan i have changed my google password 3 times since i got my phone and i cannot remember the original password i registered with. Google does not keep a listing of archived passwords. Does this mean i am permanently locked out out my phone if i cant remember my original password? Laura Covarrubias It is a very helpful and detailed information, thanks. I have a question that I hope you can help me with. I did the reset on my phone without Changing the password; I simply forgot the password and after several attempts I thought the reset was the option to go, however when I tried to set up the phone again. It did not et me to connect to wifi because the phone was unauthorized reset. Does not say anything about waiting 72 hours or gives any other option. Do you know what can I do? Thank you Xchris This should also include updating your version of android. I have to wait 24 bloody hours to use MY phone. Absolute fuckers. Why the hell can't they tell you this before the update begins. I'm furious Thomas Let me get this straight: - I own the phone - I have my new Google account password - I still remember my old Google account password and yet Google arbitrarily decides to ban me from using my phone, without providing any way to prove my identity? That's insane. On top of that, no information is given about this ban, neither on the log screen, nor in my Google dashboard. I am buying a non-Android phone first thing tomorrow morning. TCH Apple? I''m not sure if Apple has something similar? It's going ok, I just feel victim to Google as well and have to wait 72 stinking hours. No warning no nothing, had I known I would've changed my password earlier than do the factory reset. Glenn Beaumont So google tells me a foreign computer has logged into my google account whats the first two things I do??? Change my password (of course) and then reset my phone. I DO THIS FOR SECURITY - and then I get locked out. A warning would have been nice because I would have done it in the other order (reset my phone first and then changed my password) to avoid this. It's very annoying and has convinced not to buy google crap anymore. Dennis Zisman Great time to find this out! At least it is only 24 hours now, GD stupid, not making this a known fact until - Hey I'm locked out! Tren Dix When does the 72 hours lockout start?...is it everytime I Hard reset or factory reset the phone?...so when I do that it also resets the 72 hours?...it is already pass 72 hours since I made the 1st hard reset...but before that...not knowing about this problem...I have multiple hard reset my device...im using a nexus 6...it was my dads...so I dont a problem in google account...please help thanks... Kevin Really pissed about this. Here is the kicker, it will let you reset your password for google (then obviously locks you out of your phone). Which, if this account is your master for all of your google domains, if the person who supposedly stole your phone knows your email address or phone number, boom, they now have access to your google account, all of your domains, and can basically wreak havoc to web pages, etc. Google basically put my business on hold for 24 hours and revealed a hole in their security. If a competitor wants to bring me down, all they have to do is get my phone, repeatedly enter a bad password, force a factory reset, reset my google password, log on to google domains, and then proceed to bring down my domains. Way to go google. idiots. I am getting rid of my android phone and migrating my domains to godaddy or someone else.

The move Tuesday came after the U.S. Department of Labor last week said it found a gender-pay gap at the Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -0.17% GOOGL, -0.22%  unit, which is a federal contractor, during a routine compliance probe. The department is suing Google to compel the company to disclose more compensation data for its investigation. Silicon Valley tech companies have been under increasing scrutiny for hiring more white men than women or people of color, along with their pay practices. Google said each year it suggests compensation based on an employee’s role, job level, location and performance ratings. Analysts who calculate what each employee should earn don’t have access to an employee’s gender, and an employee’s manager has limited discretion to adjust the suggested amount.

Interestingly, version 7.0 adds references to a new device known as “Bisto” and other strings about multi-user enrollment, as well as possible new shortcut icons. Nintendo Switch New ‘Bisto’ device type Of particular interest in this version are references to a new device type named “Bisto.” It appears alongside Android TV, Google Home, Pixel, Phone, and Android Wear. Notably, these five devices either already have Google Assistant or are scheduled to get it later this year, as in the case of Android TV. Bisto likely has something to do with a portable audio device, with one string noting the ability to have notifications “read aloud inside your headphones.” There is also a preference for enabling “Spoken notifications.” It’s unclear what new device this codename is referring to, but one possibility is Project Aura. Early last year, it was rumored that in addition to a Glass successor, Google was also working on a solitary audio-based wearable. Multi-user enrollment With multi-user support soon coming to Home, the Google app now features several strings of its own related to the feature, as well as an enrollment process. New shortcuts The current shortcuts found on the homepage of the Google app mostly highlight small apps built into Search. Based on new images, future shortcuts might be more personalized and feature information that Assistant already knows about you.   To join the beta channel, sign-up via the Play Store.

Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP/File | Caption Loading... Amanda Hoover @amahoover April 11, 2017 —Women working at Google may have taken home smaller paychecks than their male coworkers doing similar jobs, a new report claims. Released Friday by the Department of Labor, a report investigating pay equity at Google claims that women are shortchanged at a rate worse than most tech companies, which have a history of giving men preference in hiring and pay. The probe followed a January lawsuit that sought to bar the federal government from doing business with Google as a contractor unless it addressed pay disparity concerns with an audit of its compensation records. The scathing report was filed after Google provided some of requested records regarding pay, but withheld other information, arguing that it would invade worker privacy. "We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified, according to a report published by The Guardian. The company has a long been criticized for its gender inequality in the workplace. Just 19 percent of Google’s tech positions are held by women, and the company overall doesn’t fare much better, with women making up just 30 percent of the company’s 70,000 employees. Would Google hire you? 10 test questions to find out But Google isn’t unique in its hiring practices; gender discrimination has become a common feature of the tech industry, which has favored white and Asian men over women for years. While some have taken steps to reduce the barriers or re-examined hiring practices, changes are coming slowly to the male-dominated Silicon Valley. That phenomenon comes sometimes from direct discrimination within a company, as well as a historic trend of steering women away from careers in science and technology and toward liberal arts fields. And overall, women continue to fall behind men across various fields. Last week marked Equal Pay Day for 2017, which recognizes how far into the new year the average woman must work to meet the average man’s earnings in 2016. While that gap has slowly closed, inequalities persist that put women at disadvantages. Google refuted the Labor Department's claims, arguing that it has examined its practices and made its pay methodology public. “We were quite surprised when a representative of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs at the U.S. Department of Labor (OFCCP) accused us of not compensating women fairly,” Eileen Naughton, vice president of the company’s people operations, said in a blogpost. “We were taken aback by this assertion, which came without any supporting data or methodology.” “Our analysis gives us confidence that there is no gender pay gap at Google,” she continued. That process involves analysts calculating a salary, without access to an employee’s gender, based on job role, location, and performance ratings. The salary is then fed into a pay equity model developed by the company, which looks at employees in the same job categories and looks at the salary to determine if any statistical differences exist across gender, according to Ms. Naughton.  While an employee’s manager has some say in making a final adjustment, he or she must provide a valid reason for shifting from the model.

But government crackdowns across Silicon Valley could push companies to change their ways; in seeking tech companies bidding for government contracts, the Labor Department has jurisdiction to vet the companies and decline those who lack equal pay and hiring practices based on gender and race.

According to a story published Tuesday in The Information (subscription required), Facebook created a "Teens Team" to figure out how to grab teenagers back from Snapchat, and has been up front about its tactics within the company: The internal mantra among some groups is "don't be too proud to copy." Unfortunately for Facebook, the track record for this strategy is poor. Flash back to the early 2000s, when Microsoft was the undisputed king of the tech industry, with two unassailable monopolies — operating systems and productivity apps for personal computers. It faced a lot of competitors, but the one that scared it the most was Google, which was in a completely different business. Google didn't start by creating alternatives to Windows and Office, although it did so later. Instead, it created a suite of online services — first search, followed by email and maps — that threatened the entire purpose of a personal computer. Why rely on Microsoft software running locally when you could get so much done with web apps? Microsoft's response? Trying to build the exact same service that made Google famous — a search engine, first known as MSN Search, later rebranded to Bing. Eleven years later, Bing is a small minority player in search, with less than 10 percent market share on the desktop and less than 1 percent in mobile, according to NetMarketShare. Google dominates with almost 80 percent share on the desktop and well over 90 percent in mobile. "Google" has become a verb. Nobody "Bings" anything. Bolstered by the massive margins in search advertising, Google has moved farther and farther into Microsoft's core territory, adding a massively successful mobile operating system (Android), web browser (Chrome), online productivity apps (Google for Work) and an increasingly robust cloud computing business. It also surpassed Microsoft in market cap for the first time in 2012, and remains ahead today. Google faced its own Bing moment in 2011, when it faced a challenge from then-upstart Facebook. The social network didn't threaten Google by building a better search engine. It did so by creating an entirely different online service, based around social networking and real identities, that drew people's attention away from search and other Google properties. As people spent more and more time on Facebook, advertisers followed. Google's response? To launch a competing social network based on real identities called Google+. It was just as successful as Bing — which is to say, not successful at all. Facebook may still win. After all, Microsoft used this playbook very effectively in the 1990s to eliminate the threat posed by Netscape Navigator — it built a better browser, then shipped it with Windows. It dominated web browsing for almost a decade (until Google came along with Chrome and Apple's iPhone introduced the concept of effective mobile web browsing). But Microsoft in the 1990s had an effective monopoly on personal computing platforms with Windows. If you wanted to go online, you had to go out of your way not to use Windows. The same is not true for Facebook — there are many ways to communicate and share information in real time with friends, including text messaging platforms like SMS and Apple's iMessage, and competing social networks like Twitter and — yes — Snapchat. Facebook will have to do more to regain teens' attention than simply duplicating every feature that made Snapchat popular. Disclsoure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Snap.

Fraudsters are using them to con people into employing the services of unofficial and unaccredited workers, like builders, plumbers or locksmiths. 2 Scammers are claiming business locations so they can redirect traffic to their own sites For example, a fraudster might list a plumber at a location on Google Maps when they don’t actually have a premises there. When a customer calls the phone number listed online, they are actually being put through to a call centre which hires unofficial workers to do odd jobs. Often the customer ends up forking a lot more than the original quoted price, Google researchers found. Google Maps adds real-time location tracker 2 Google has recently updated added lots of new features, including the capability to share your real-time location with pals Scientists at Google and the University of San Diego studied 100,000 listings posted between 2014 and 2015. Most were electricians, plumbers and locksmiths. Google tried to put an end to this by sending out letters to the location which has been claimed online. These letters have verification codes, so if the request to claim a location is legitimate, the person at the address can enter it online. But scammers have been able to intervene and rent post boxes. “People who need assistance can unfortunately be easily exploited. If you’re locked out of your house you won’t necessarily check all of the customer reviews – you just want to get inside," Michael Levi from Cardiff University, UK told New Scientist. Google Maps has added lots of new features. One lets you stalk your mates (and straying other halves…). And it thrilled Ms Pac Man fans with an update on April Fool's. We pay for your stories!

Google is testing screenshot cropping and drawing tools in its search app Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 4:01am PDTApr 11, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 55 Share on Facebook 61 Share on Twitter Total Shares146 Applications Google News Google has been tinkering with screenshots for a few months. First, some hidden code was found in Nougat that would trigger partial screenshot functionality, then we started hearing of a screenshot cropping and drawing option showing up inside the Google app. That last bit is starting to show for some users including our reader Nicholas who shared the news on Reddit and further explained how it works. If you're on the lucky end of this server-side test, when you open the Google app, you'll be greeted with a new permission to access device storage. Google explains that this will be used to improve the handling of screenshots taken "in the app," so you should be ready for disappointment if you expected this to be a system-wide option. After that, when you're inside the Google app and you take a regular screenshot with your device (power + volume down on most phones), a sharing menu will slide from the bottom of the screen with two new options: Crop and Draw. The first lets you crop a specific part of the screen, the second lets you draw on top of the screenshot with 6 different colors (plus an Undo option). When you're done, you can share the result to any other application. Here's a video of it in action: This looks handy, even if it's limited to only the Google app for now and would be more beneficial as a system-wide option. Those of us with Samsung phones have been able to crop and edit screenshots for years now and even take scrolling screenshots on Nougat, and those with LG phones have had QuickCapture for years as well with the option to draw and crop any screen before even screenshot-ing it first. But it's still a limited test. None of us here at Android Police have the feature yet, despite being on the same 6.16.31 beta release as Nicholas. It looks like the feature is still not ready for the public yet. By the time it is, I hope Google decides on a unified way of exiting the cropping and drawing modes. Having the "X Done" toast-like button at the bottom for the former and the X and checkmark bar at the top for the latter is weird.

Fajrul Emirullah in mine is nope being like that, maybe you must reinstall again or clear data Dan I have it happen from time to time. tap in the search bar and then tap back, the feed should refresh with cards in it again. A normal pull to refresh won't cut it. Phoenix I tried that, and clearing cash and data several times but it goes blank after showing me cards for a minute or two. thanks anyway . Carpentractor Try touching the search input box and your feed should appear. I guess it's some weird feature that has made it from the Beta into the stable, they should really try to fix this buggy crap. Pete I'm still waiting for the tabs at the bottom of the feed, plus the horizontally scrollable list of content at the top, as well as Assistant. Think Nexus owners have been forgotten in the UK. Sick of these farcical staged rollouts of software and server-side switches. Tom Erlandsen Hah, snap (I just posted the same complaint above). Incidentally I'm also UK and haven't received any of that stuff Tom Erlandsen I really hate these server-side changes. I still haven't gotten the tabs at the bottom of Google Now, or the suggestions bar along the top. Those must have been announced at LEAST 6 months ago, but still no sign on my device. I also never got the shortcuts in Now on Tap (for calendar events, navigating home, etc) before it got replaced by Assistant. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4485081f9593936ffbf0789a560eaf3f2d19ca8f91c81a9ea6d475f2634f9584.png Pete Exactly the same for me, but I still haven't got Assistant either. Sashank Narayan Set your default system language to English (US) if it isn't already. That should enable Assistant right away on your device. They did say that English (UK) and English (Australia) will follow soon. Pete Yes but there's "soon", and there's "taking the p***"! And how is it that Android devices from other manufacturers have it in the UK, with their languages set as English (UK), but Google haven't enabled it for their own devices? It makes no sense. Love Google, but sick of these staged rollouts and server-side switches. Sashank Narayan ¯_(ಠ_ಠ) _/¯ is all I can say. Completely agree with you -- staged rollouts are alright because you can still sideload the apk, but server-side switches suck. Quite a few things Google has been doing recently make no sense. :-/ kalehv Honestly, as much as I hate waiting for server side switches to show mercy on me, I really like the idea. I'm a mobile apps developer and we use these switches all the time. We call it feature flags. It makes life a lot easier to ship apps with features and then just flip the flag instead of creating a whole new release for a feature. Pete Yeah, but when a swathe of the planet gets a feature and the rest doesn't, and yet the developer keeps going on via blogs & social media about how great that feature is... It's pretty annoying if you're in that chunk of the world that hasn't had it enabled. (See also: Search app changes, Assistant, Podcasts in GPM, YouTube Red, face matching in Photos, Google Protect... I could go on.) kalehv Yup, I totally agree. It's also hard to live with that when you're one of the readers of this site (probably are a techie or tech enthusiast) and when it's about wider public apps like Google's. Fresh360 I thought the same but I actually had to manually turn on Assistant. It did not automatically replace my Google Now, I went into setting in the Google App and turned on Assistant. demarcmj Count yourself lucky. The new tabbed interface is awful. Manikandan Guru I haven't got that weather, calculator things at the top. Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Neither have I. Coin flip and barrel roll sounds funny too. chromaniac I recently got it so I guess it is being rolled out as well. demarcmj Why is this in the Google app? This is not an app kid of thing.

It honestly feels like a huge downgrade to me. I want to be able to do a text search from any screen, I rarely have the opportunity to use voice search. I used to select text using Now on Tap that was not selectable all the time. I've found a workaround that takes 10 taps and a ton of waiting instead of the 3 quick taps of old. And translate from any screen. I play CoC with several international players who chat in numerous Asian dialects, Now on Tap would sort this out with Screen Search in 3 taps no worries. I got sick of not having these things and changed my language from English Australian to English Virgin Islands, but now it messes up the street name pronunciation all the time. So frustrating. Oatz Thank you! I hate it and the fact that it's forced upon us. Morenicano Agreed! I hope they hurry and add these features back Cheer Chunhao Two years later Google is now testing a complete OS in their search app Teja Just what they did with Chrome OS for laptops & Web apps for Windows PC ;) Few years earlier Google is now testing a complete OS in their browser. Jose Romero The sharing screenshots feature does not belong in the Google search app. We can already share screenshots with the native Android feature.

Machine learning, new monetization criteria and third-party measurement are giving some experts hope. By Bree Rody-Mantha 14 hours ago Some might say it’s been a tough couple of weeks for YouTube. A rise in awareness about offensive and defamatory user generated content led to a flood of brands publicly pausing their advertising on the platform — which in turn led to a flood of bad PR for the Google-owned video platform. Since then, Google has publicly announced a number of changes to its policies regarding content and the uploading processes that are designed, in part, to provide brands with greater quality assurance of the videos they are buying against. The first change is an expansion of the safeguards on its YouTube Partners program, which will no longer allow creators to monetize their content until they have received 10,000 lifetime views (previously, any channel with any number of subscribers or views could make advertising revenue). At the point of receiving 10,000 views, YouTube will then vet and approve the channel for monetization. Google has also introduced machine learning capabilities to potentially weed out and demonetize offensive content. According to a Google spokesperson, the YouTube tools have been built to understand the context of content, so it could, for example, distinguish between a racial slur used in a rap song and one used in a racist video. It’s also expanded its partnerships with third-party measurement providers such as Moat, Integral Ad Science and DoubleVerify, giving them expanded auditing powers to assure more accuracy in metrics. A Google spokesperson told strategy‘s sister publication MediaInCanada.com that these measures have been in development for a number of months, but that the company ramped up the development following the negative publicity storm. Sam Sebastian, VP of Google and managing director of Google Canada, offered a statement to MiC saying that the platform has seen a willingness from Canadian advertisers to restart their campaigns. “While they know that no system can be perfect, they appreciate the actions we’ve taken and know we are taking this seriously and are committed to getting better and better.” But are these measures enough for the industry? Matt Ramella, head of digital partnerships and strategy for IPG Mediabrands Canada, pointed out that the new changes to YouTube’s Partner program are more geared at the creators than advertisers. “The new changes… primarily [help] to protect creators from abusive channels that impersonate and re-upload content from original content creators in order to make money,” he told MiC. “That said, it’s another small piece in the brand safety puzzle as the new safeguard allows YouTube to review a channel.” Ramella said his company was generally approving of the updates and confident with YouTube’s new measures. Nick Barbuto, managing director of OMD’s Ignition Factory, said the granularity of YouTube’s AI measures were impressive and exciting, “not only from a brand safety perspective but also a targeting perspective.” OMD’s parent group Omnicom’s official position is that Google’s proposals do hold the promise of a better environment for advertisers, however “the proof of these measures remains to be seen.” It has said it will continue to assess the situation along with clients.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Pixel 2 XL “confirmed” by Google release Chris Burns - Apr 11, 2017 5 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google has revealed that they’ll be releasing at least two new Google Pixel devices on dates likely set for Autumn of 2017.* This year’s reveal could come very close to the Pixel release date from last year – October for the reveal and release a couple weeks later. We’re crossing our fingers for a slightly smoother launch – and more realistic expectations for demand – this time around! *The reveal comes courtesy of a source that often reveal the earliest glimpses of Google’s hardware products. Committing code to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) gerrit, two (or possibly three) new Google Android devices have appeared. Given the names, the code structure, and Google’s history with similarly-named products of this size, the Android Police discovery of these codes lends itself to some big expectations for the next wave of Google smartphones. Sizes for Nexus devices have generally corresponded (loosely) with the names of the fish with which they’re associated. The list below, starting with Mako back in 2012 with the Nexus 4, shows how larger devices get over time, sticking with Shamu (the whale) as the largest (still) with the 6-inch Nexus 6. A Pixel XXL code-named Taimen might be bigger than the Nexus 6 while its name suggests it remains smaller. Fish Codenames for Google Smartphones: • 2012: Nexus 4_____(Mako) • 2013: Nexus 5_____(Hammerhead) • 2014: Nexus 6_____(Shamu) • 2015: Nexus 5X____(Bullhead) ••2015: Nexus 6P____(Angler) • 2016: Pixel_______(Sailfish) ••2016: Pixel XL____(Marlin) • 2017: Pixel 2_____(Walleye) ••2017: Pixel 2 XL__(Muskie) ••2017: Pixel XXL___(Taimen) While history would suggest that Taimen would be a third smartphone, due to the name, it’s not confirmed just yet. We’re still in a strange place when it comes to Pixel devices – especially considering the history the brand has with notebooks and such. This Taiman could be in a whole new device category altogether. SEE TOO: Google Pixel 2: Processor Devil’s in the details The most recent code update to AOSP on Google Source that included the term “Taiman” also included reference to Sailfish, Marlin, Walleye, and Muskie. The most recent reference to Angler also referenced Bullhead, but none of the 5 newest devices. These devices are being approached differently – as well they should be expected to. Now we have only to confirm whether the last item on the list, Taiman, is going to be a large smartphone, a small tablet, or the missing tablet/notebook hybrid whose first-gen name was Pixel C. It would not be a shocker if we got a few clues at this year’s Google I/O developers’ conference. Google I/O 2017 will be taking place May 17th, 18th, and 19th, 2017, and it’ll once again be outdoors at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California.

With thousands of SSL certificates wrongly issued to cybercriminals, is it still worth bothering with HTTPS? By Mary-Ann Russon April 11, 2017 18:50 BST Does the padlock icon on our web browsers still mean anything, or have certificate authorities turned HTTPS encryption into a joke?iStock If you know anything about internet security, then you probably know that the little padlock symbol on the address bar in your web browser signifies that the website you're visiting is protected by HTTPS encryption. HTTPS encryption is what ensures that the connection between your computer, your bank and online retailers is secure, so that no sensitive information or money from financial transactions can be stolen by cybercriminals. Sounds great. So what's the problem? What you probably don't know is that there is a battle currently waging over certificate authorities (CAs). These are the entities that issue SSL certificates; small data files that protect users' data on websites and enable HTTPS encryption. The issue is that more and more CAs are being pulled up for misissuing security certificates, either by accident, due to a security vulnerability, or due to negligence in issuing the certificates to sites run by cybercriminals. Rising cases of CAs found wrongly issuing security certificates For instance, in March, Google Chrome's developers announced that they would stop recognising any security certificates issued by Symantec, a well-known cybersecurity firm and one of the biggest certificate authorities on the internet. Symantec validates 42% of all security certificates, and by blocking its certificates users won't be able to access many legitimate websites too. Google says it was pushed to take the decision because its investigation revealed that Symantec improperly issued 30,000 certificates over several years. Of course, Symantec has disputed Google's decision, insisting that Google's comments are misleading and exaggerated, and that the number of certificates misissued was only 127. Yet this is not the only instance of SSL certificates being wrongly issued. In 2016, the CA Let's Encrypt issued 15,270 SSL certificates that contained the word "PayPal", and 96% of those security certificates were issued to domains that were hosting phishing sites (malicious websites that impersonate legitimate services to trick users into handing over account details and financial information). Since the SSL Store's encryption experts discovered this extensive breach of Let's Encrypt free SSL certification system, Let's Encrypt has not responded. In the past, it has made it clear that it does not see itself as the police of the internet. Let's Encrypt says that its mission is to encrypt the whole internet, and if that means that some cybercriminals get encrypted too, well then the greater good outweighs the risk. Is there still a point in securing websites using HTTPS? "Even a single unauthorised certificate is a cause for concern. Repeated instances to that order serve to erode the trust model. Instances involving high-profile names collapse the trust as billions of people and trillions of transactions can potentially be compromised," F-Secure's chief information security officer Erka Koivunen told IBTimes UK. "Browsers and operating systems have steadily increased the number of CAs and CA certificates that they trust by default. There should also be discussion about whether the certificate revocation process is broken. Some browsers and applications will never know if a certificate has been revoked. The well-meaning instructions to go and look for 'HTTPS://' or a padlock sign mean less and less each day as you have less and less certainty over who it is that you are communicating with over an encrypted channel. Friend or foe, who knows?" Not everyone agrees with how Google is handling the situation with Symantec. On one hand, it's good to call out companies when grievous sins have been committed, but if Chrome refuses to accept authentication from Symantec-issued SSL certificates, this will hit a lot of perfectly innocent websites. "Certificates are a key part of the system of trust that underlies the security of every machine on the Internet – there is no replacement so we really need to continue to make this system work. To do this, the tech and security industries as a whole need to work collaboratively to identify the misuse and miss-issuance of certificates. CAs have a responsibility to improve their processes but they are far from alone in carrying this burden," argues Venafi's chief cybersecurity strategist Kevin Bocek. "CAs generally need to get better at identifying unauthorised or out of policy certificates. However, the identity of machines and use of encryption is so important that it can't be left to CAs alone, businesses must take action, responsibility and gain agility." How can we tell if a website is really secure? FireEye's senior intelligence account analyst Jens Monrad still feels that HTTPS has value, but it all depends on whether the SSL certificate is trusted and valid. So how can we tell? "It is worth offering an encrypted communication path via HTTPS, if the issued certificate is trusted and valid, and not self-signed. Many organisations deploy self-signed certificates on their servers and infrastructure, and a lot of end users do not check who the issuer of the certificate is. This means that a weak certificate, regardless of its purpose, might generate a false sense of secure communications," he told IBTimes UK. "The cyber security and wider tech industry is constantly trying to address the risk of fraud via certificates, as well as transactions of financial data. However, there are no solutions out there that are 100% reliable, so I would also suggest that consumers make sure to inspect if the website they are purchasing from is using a valid and trusted certificate. "Clicking the padlock icon next to the HTTPS URL typically reveals the relevant information, where the user can quickly assess who the issuer of the certificate is and if the certificate itself is trusted."

Trump spoke at a White House meeting with business leaders who are part of his strategic and policy forum. Trump said the agreement has “been a disaster since the day it was devised.” In addition to “pleasant surprises for you” on the NAFTA front, Trump reiterated his commitment to cutting taxes and regulations. Trump also said the cost of maintaining government computers that are 40 years old is so high that “we can buy a whole new system for less money than that.” He joked that he would give the business leaders $10 billion immediately to fix the government’s information technology system. What makes the 2017 CR the worst yet for Defense? JOB OPENINGS US employers posted more jobs in February and quitting fell WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers posted more open positions in February, but the number of people getting hired and the number quitting jobs fell. The overall figures suggest that the job market remains healthy, although it has yet to take off during the early stages of the Trump presidency. The Labor Department says job openings rose 2.1 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted 5.7 million. While more employers are seeking workers, hiring fell 2 percent compared to January to 5.3 million. More than 2.5 million people quit their jobs in February, a sharp 19.6 percent decline from January. This may be a sign that workers have mixed confidence about the economy, since workers typically quit either when they have another job, or are optimistic they can find one. GOOGLE-GENDER DISCRIMINATION CASE Google refutes charges, says there is no gender pay gap NEW YORK (AP) — Google says it’s “taken aback” by the government’s claim that it doesn’t compensate women fairly. The company says it conducts “rigorous analyses” that its pay practices are gender-blind. It says analysts who calculate suggested pay don’t have access to employees’ gender data. Google says it analyzed 52 major job categories last year and found “no gender pay gap.” The U.S. Department of Labor had accused Google of shortchanging women doing similar work to men, saying it found “systemic compensation disparities” across the company’s workforce. In a blog post today, Google said that beyond gender pay equity, the company recently expanded the analysis to cover race in the U.S. as well. The department had no comment, saying the case is ongoing. GERMANY-APPLE SUPPLIER Shares in chipmaker Dialog plunge over Apple contract doubts BERLIN (AP) — Shares in British-headquartered Dialog Semiconductor have plunged after an analyst downgrade that cited uncertainty over the future of its relationship with Apple. Shares in the firm were down 16.7 percent to 39.81 euros ($42.14) in afternoon trading today in Frankfurt, where Dialog Semiconductor is listed. They regained some ground after earlier dropping as low as 30.60 euros. The selling followed an analyst note from Bankhaus Lampe that downgraded Dialog to “sell.” It said there appeared to be “strong evidence” that Apple is developing its own power management chip for the iPhone and “intends to replace the chip made by Dialog at least in part.” Last week, shares in British chipmaker Imagination Technologies dived after that company announced that Apple plans to stop using its products. CANADA-YAHOO-SECURITY BREACH Canadian judge in Yahoo hack case to reach decision on bail HAMILTON, Ontario (AP) — The lawyer for a Canadian man accused in a massive hack of Yahoo emails says his client will be living with his parents without access to the internet and electronics if released on bail. American officials allege that Karim Baratov poses an “extremely high flight risk” because of his alleged ties to Russian agents. Baratov’s parents have agreed to act as their son’s sureties. The young man’s attorney Deepak Paradkar said today that Baratov will never be alone because his father Akhmet Tokbergenov works at home. Paradkar says the father has agreed to turn off the internet in the family home if the court requests. Baratov was arrested last month and faces extradition to the U.S. Justice Alan Whitten has said he’ll reach a bail decision today. SOLAR ENERGY-CALIFORNIA California’s solar energy set power supply record in March SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A new estimate from the U.S. government shows that California met about half of the state’s electricity demand for three hours on March 11. The San Francisco Chronicle reports (http://bit.ly/2nAQZST ) the state’s goal is for 50 percent of all electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030. The estimate came from the U.S. Department of Energy’s statistics division. The newspaper reports the division used data from the California Independent System Operator. It manages the electricity grid across 80 percent of California and part of Nevada. The record was set when almost 40 percent of the electricity flowing across the grid came from large-scale solar power plants. Homes and businesses in the area served by the grid generated the additional power that increased solar energy production for the three-hour period. XEROX SPIN-OFF-JOBS Xerox spin-off to move call center jobs to neighboring town IRONDEQUOIT, N.Y. (AP) — A spin-off company of Xerox Corp. says it plans to move its call center from one Rochester suburb to another, adding several hundred jobs in the process. Conduent Inc., the former business services division of Norwalk, Connecticut-based Xerox, says it will move the operations from Webster to a former retail store in a vacant mall in the neighboring town of Irondequoit (uh-RAHN’-duh-kwoyt). The move into the former Macy’s store at the Medley Centre mall will occur sometime in the fall. Four-hundred workers will make the move, while company officials say another 350 jobs will be added. Renovation work at the new call center operations is expected to be completed by mid-August. Flaum Management purchased the Macy’s site nearly two years ago, after the retailer moved out.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK — Google said it’s “taken aback “ by the government’s claim that it doesn’t compensate women fairly. The company said it conducts “rigorous analyses” that its pay practices are gender-blind and found “no gender pay gap” in 52 major job categories it analyzed last year. Google added that analysts who calculate suggested pay don’t have access to employees’ gender data. Google also said that beyond gender pay equity, the company recently expanded the analysis to cover race in the U.S. as well. The U.S. Department of Labor had accused Google of shortchanging women doing similar work to men, saying it found “systemic compensation disparities” across the company’s workforce. Google responded in a blog post today that the department’s assertion “came without any supporting data or methodology.” The company said it had already produced hundreds of thousands of documents in response to 18 separate requests, and the government is seeking thousands more, including contact details of employees. The department had no comment, saying the case is ongoing. The difference between Google’s and the Labor Department’s claims might come down to how each side defines pay discrimination, Tim Worstall, a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute in London, wrote in a recent post for Forbes. “Google is using a strict definition of ‘same job’ to find no gender pay gap. The Department of Labor is using a looser definition of ‘similar job’ to find that there is one,” he wrote. “Who you think is right here is entirely up to you but that’s where the disagreement is.” Related Items united states , north america , U.S. Department of Labor , United States government , pay gap Click to comment Guidelines: Please keep your comments smart and civil.

However, its usefulness increases  considerably once you take into account the AirTV Adapter ($40). Easily the most innovative feature of  the AirTV, this USB dongle lets you plug in an HD antenna and route all of your local channels through your AirTV box. Far from being an optional gimmick, the antenna integration is both gorgeous and useful, even if it really should have been included with the core product. Ultimately, the AirTV is a good — but not great — streaming box, but it takes some time to prove itself. Design: Different If nothing else, the AirTV deserves some credit for not being a big, black box. Instead, the peripheral adopts a much, well, airier palette: white on top, and sky blue on the bottom. There's also a red power indicator on the front. The device is a good size: not tiny, but not obnoxiously big, either. Measuring about 5 inches across and 1 inch high, it's bigger than the Apple TV and the Amazon Fire TV, and about the same size as the Roku Ultra. The back includes a number of ports. In addition to two USB ports and a digital audio port, users can plug in an Ethernet cord (not required; the device has Wi-Fi as well) and an HDMI cable. I was a little disappointed, though, to find that there was no expandable memory, and downright frustrated when I learned that the AirTV has a relatively paltry 6GB of available storage space. Interface: Sling TV first Let me put this as simply as possible: If you aren't a Sling TV subscriber, there's almost no reason you would want an AirTV. Sling TV isn't just one app among many; it's the basis for the whole interface. From the moment you complete the AirTV's simple setup process, you'll have to return to a Sling TV app time and time again, whether you want to watch Netflix, play a game or tinker with system settings. On one hand, it's convenient if you want a streaming box primarily as a Sling TV player; on the other hand, it's unnecessarily complicated to do anything else. The AirTV doesn't really have a home screen, as other Android TV devices do. Instead, there's a special page of the Sling TV app that contains your favorite channels and bookmarked content. Then, at the bottom of the page, almost like an afterthought, there's a row of recommended content from Netflix and a bar that lets you access other apps. This is where you'll go for Hulu, Spotify, Plex, Final Fantasy III or any other Android TV app. For users who have tried Amazon's Fire TV products, the undue emphasis on Sling TV will be familiar. After all, the AirTV is a Dish product; why not highlight its signature app? On the other hand, while the Fire TV does put Amazon content first and foremost, it's still relatively simple to get to non-Amazon apps and games. That's not the case with the AirTV, which relegates an entire operating system to a single button, hidden at the bottom of a home screen that isn't really a home screen. Getting around Sling TV is easy, at least. A bar at the top of the screen lets you navigate among all of your various Sling Orange, Blue and optional package channels, plus whatever you get from your HD antenna (more on that later). Although it's not a direct criticism of the AirTV, Sling TV desperately needs a better channel guide.  It's pretty easy to see what's on any given channel, and what came before and after the current program. However, there's no way to bring up a comprehensive guide and see what's playing on 10 or 20 channels simultaneously, as traditional cable and PlayStation Vue offer. Finding a program can be tedious, whether you do it via search or channel surfing. Beyond the Sling TV app, the AirTV has a traditional Android TV interface — that is, it's functional, but not very good. Finding apps is easy enough if you take advantage of Google's excellent search protocols; there's a Google button, and the remote has voice search. Otherwise, expect to scroll through tons of oddly organized apps before you find what you're looking for. If you want to organize your myriad apps after downloading them, you're out of luck. I respect that Android TV is a clean and versatile interface, but by now, it should really be more customizable. Remote: Chintzy The AirTV remote looks and feels like a toy. It's made of blue and white plastic with a matte feel, is much wider than a Roku remote and uses its available space much less efficiently. The blue strip on the left of the remote contains a power button, a voice search activator, a volume button, a mute button and a diamond button that has no clear purpose. (The AirTV doesn't come with a user manual, nor is there one available on the website.) The right side of the device is much more crowded. The top of the remote has four buttons dedicated to Sling TV: a Sling button that brings up the app; Info; a heart (for favoriting content); and Guide. Below that, there are four directional buttons with an OK button in the center, and then Back, Play/Pause and Recall (which brings you back to a previous channel) below that. There are also small, circular buttons for Netflix and Google search. It's an odd hodgepodge of traditional TV and streaming-device commands. The remote can't quite decide whether it's there to help you navigate channels or help you navigate a streaming-box operating system, and as such, it doesn't fully succeed in either task. There's no easy way to get to your Android TV apps, once again making everything but Sling TV feel like an afterthought. Content and Apps: Better for video than games As discussed above, Sling TV is the star attraction on the AirTV. If you use it a lot, you simply won't be able to find a streaming box that makes better use of its features. Some of those features, like the Guide, still need work, but in terms of navigable, attractive interfaces, this is about as good as it gets. Otherwise, you can access whatever you want from the Android TV store, provided that it requires less than 6GB of storage. Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Pandora, Spotify, Google Play Movies and Music, Plex, Crackle, VLC Media Player and other popular media apps are all present. Although it's a pain to reach the apps from the AirTV's home screen, it's simple to install and use them(Android TV doesn't have access to Amazon Video, either, but that's not a problem with the AirTV specifically.) Gaming, on the other hand, is a bit of a problem. Android TV has a wonderful selection of games to suit every taste, from classic role-playing games to casual puzzle titles. Unfortunately, though the AirTV offers access to almost every game in the Android TV library, not all of them will work. Most of them will, but remember: The device has only 6GB of storage. There's one thing the AirTV does better than any of its competitors: HD antenna integration. As such, you won't be able to play big, complex games that require a lot of installation space.Because there are no microSD card slots and you can't use USB storage as expandable memory, there are a handful of games you won't be able to play. (Final Fantasy IX is the one I encountered trouble with; if there's another title you have your eye on, check the space requirements before buying it.) This isn't a huge or widespread problem, but it's one more example of how every Android TV feature takes a backseat to Sling TV. Antenna: Star of the show There's one thing the AirTV does better than any of its competitors: HD antenna integration. To be perfectly honest, before I plugged my antenna into the AirTV, I was ready to write it off as just another good-enough, me-too streaming box — and one that had virtually no appeal outside of Sling customers, at that. Seeing the beautiful way in which it handled broadcast channels changed my mind. First off, to hook up your HD antenna to the AirTV, you'll need an optional $40 adapter. If you buy both the box and the adapter together, you can pay $130 in total instead of $140, but still, the adapter should have come with the box. It's the one unique selling point of the AirTV, and there's not much point in getting one without the other. The adapter is plug-and-play. As soon as I hooked up the adapter and my antenna, the AirTV automatically recognized them and asked whether I wanted to run the setup procedure — no restarts, no manual mucking about in menus. Finding the 70-odd channels in my area took only a few minutes, although this may vary depending on what kind of antenna you have and how far you live from the broadcast source. Once the setup is done, your antenna channels become part of your regular Sling TV experience. There's no special "antenna channels" tab; you just scroll right past your Orange and Blue selections, and there they are. Almost every channel has an icon, a name and a complete guide that covers its schedule for the whole day. I've had an HD antenna for months, and the AirTV finally taught me channel names and programming I'd never known about before. There are a few trade-offs to attaching the antenna to an AirTV rather than a television. You can't simply channel surf; you need to select channels at the top of the screen, as with any other Sling station. Furthermore, each channel takes a few seconds to load, rather than appearing instantaneously as they do on a regular TV. Still, the benefits are more than worth the hassle. Performance The AirTV can handle 4K programming (though not HDR), putting it about on a par with the Amazon Fire TV, the Google Chromecast Ultra and some of the higher-end Roku boxes. Navigation isn't as snappy as it could be, but it generally didn't take too long for me to load apps, navigate among screens and jump between Sling TV channels. While the device has some trouble running high-end games (see the Content and Apps section), simpler titles run beautifully, and you're more than welcome to hook up any Bluetooth controller. Bottom Line As a stand-alone streaming box, the AirTV is a competent, but not very exciting, device with a distracting fixation on Sling TV content. Taken together with its HD antenna adapter, though, it's something unique. Though other streaming devices, including the Nvidia Shield TV and the Xbox One, can handle HD antenna channels, no other device integrates it so beautifully within its existing OS. But the AirTV's slick HD antenna integration alone isn't enough to excuse some of its more glaring faults. Navigation feels fractured, the Android TV elements are underplayed and the remote isn't very helpful. Still, if you're a Sling TV fan (or willing to become one) and want to combine that experience with a full suite of broadcast channels, it's hard to think of a more convenient way to do it.

I have 2 TVs and an external tuner and they all get consistently 39 channels. This piece of crap only pulled in 19 channels no matter what I tried. Also the integration is just the same as any other android tv box that has the live channels section so don't be fooled by all the hype. Also storage is only a measly 8gb. 0 Benedetto_1 Apr 11, 2017, 11:32 AM Only dual core , also could not set up sound device using the remote, kept getting message trouble connecting to the internet, try again later. Lastly the remote suddenly would no longer connect despite resetting it still no luck. I gave up a shield android tv player for this hunk of junk.

By taking care of your app back-end or infrastructure, Firebase lets you focus on solving problems for your users. One of the new exciting features announced at the Google Cloud Next '17 Conference this March for Firebase was Cloud Functions. In this tutorial, you'll learn about this new feature by building a simple Android app with it.  What Are Cloud Functions for Firebase? Firebase Cloud Functions run in a hosted, private, and scalable Node.js environment where you can run JavaScript code. You simply create reactive functions that trigger whenever an event occurs. Cloud functions are available for both Google Cloud Platform and Firebase (they were built on top of Google Cloud Functions).  For now, Cloud Functions support the following triggers that you can listen to and respond to: Realtime Database Triggers: fire a function when a write event occurs on a path in a database. Authentication Triggers: fire a function when a new user is created or when a user is deleted. Analytics Triggers: fire a function when a new conversion event is logged. Cloud Storage Triggers: a function can be fired when there is any change in a bucket such as a file or folder upload, update, or delete. Cloud Pub/Sub Triggers: fire a function when a new message is received in a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic. HTTPS Triggers: fire when a request is made to an endpoint. So Why Use Cloud Functions? So now you have seen the range of capabilities that Cloud Functions can offer. But why use them?  Running and setting up a back end and servers can be a real pain—you have to handle issues such as scalability and writing code in server-side languages—but with Cloud Functions, this complexity is reduced. Also, computationally intensive tasks can be performed in the cloud instead of on the client device (such as image resizing for upload or writing to multiple paths of your database). Your code will also be more secure in the cloud than on the client device, so you can securely store data such as secret keys on your server.  In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use the Realtime Database Triggers that will fire when a database write event occurs. Then, we'll see how to use the Firebase Cloud Messaging service to send a notification to devices that subscribed to a topic. We'll create a simple app called Tutsplus Alerts, which will send a notification to subscribers of the "android" topic whenever a new article is available. Prerequisites  To follow along with this tutorial, you should be familiar with: Firebase Realtime Database Firebase Cloud Messaging Setting up a Firebase Project And you should have Node.js installed on your computer. Check out the following tutorials here on Envato Tuts+ if you need some help getting started with Firebase: Android SDK Get Started With Firebase for Android Ashraff Hathibelagal Firebase Firebase for Android: Notifications and App Invites Paul Trebilcox-Ruiz Android SDK Get Started With Firebase for Android Ashraff Hathibelagal 1. Create a Firebase Cloud Function Install the Firebase CLI  Now that the prerequisites are set up, let's download Cloud Functions. To begin to use Cloud Functions, we need the Firebase CLI (command-line interface) installed from npm. If you already have Node set up on your machine, you can install Cloud Functions with: npm install -g firebase-tools This command will install the Firebase CLI globally along with any necessary Node.js dependencies. Initialize the Project To initialize your project: Run firebase login to log in to Firebase via the browser and authenticate the CLI tool. Create a new project directory with the name tutsplus-alerts. Finally, run firebase init functions from that new directory. This tool gives you an option to install dependencies with NPM. It is safe to decline if you want to manage dependencies in another way. After these commands complete successfully, your project structure looks like this: .firebaserc: a hidden file that helps you quickly switch between projects with firebase use. firebase.json: describes properties for your project. functions/: this folder contains all the code for your functions. functions/package.json: an NPM package file describing your Cloud Functions. functions/index.js: the main source for your Cloud Functions code. functions/node_modules/: the folder where all your NPM dependencies are installed. Import the Needed Modules and Initialize the App  To develop our simple Tutsplus Alerts app, we just need two node modules: Cloud Functions and Admin SDK modules (these modules are already installed for us). So go to the index.js and require these modules, and then initialize an admin app instance. var functions = require('firebase-functions');
var admin = require('firebase-admin');

admin.initializeApp(functions.config().firebase); Code the Cloud Function Now that the required modules for our project have been imported and initialized, let's code our cloud function in the index.js file. As stated earlier, we are going to write a function that will be fired when an onWrite() event occurs in our Firebase realtime database and then, in response, will send a notification (a downstream message) to device subscribers. // ...
exports.sendNotification = functions.database.ref('/articles/{articleId}')
        .onWrite(event => {

        // Grab the current value of what was written to the Realtime Database.
        var eventSnapshot = event.data;
        var str1 = "Author is ";
        var str = str1.concat(eventSnapshot.child("author").val());
        console.log(str);

        var topic = "android";
        var payload = {
            data: {
                title: eventSnapshot.child("title").val(),
                author: eventSnapshot.child("author").val()
            }
        };

        // Send a message to devices subscribed to the provided topic.
        return admin.messaging().sendToTopic(topic, payload)
            .then(function (response) {
                // See the MessagingTopicResponse reference documentation for the
                // contents of response.
                console.log("Successfully sent message:", response);
            })
            .catch(function (error) {
                console.log("Error sending message:", error);
            });
        }); In the code above, we are listening to the database path /articles/{articleId}, where {articleId} represents the id of the article that was successfully written. Now, what we are really concerned about is the data that was written. To get that, we use event.data, which is a DeltaSnapshot static interface.  Afterwards, add data from this snapshot to a message payload and send it to the "android" topic. The asynchronous code is simplified with JavaScript promises.  Note that in the code above, we wrote to the console by using console.log(), which will help us in debugging and monitoring. We can view this log either in our Firebase dashboard or via the command line with:  firebase functions:log Be aware that since this runs on Node.js, you can install other modules available from NPM. You can also code in JavaScript ES6 or TypeScript instead of vanilla JavaScript.  Deploy the Cloud Function Let's deploy our Cloud Function. Run this command for deployment: $ firebase deploy --only functions Now we can code the Android app that will subscribe to the topic, write to the realtime database, and receive a notification when data is written to our realtime database—that is when our cloud function would be executed!  2. Create the TutsplusAlerts App Create an Android Studio Project First, fire up Android Studio and create a new project ''TutsplusAlerts" with an empty activity called MainActivity. To follow along, make sure you have integrated Firebase into your app.  Add the Realtime Database Dependency Add the following dependency to your build.gradle file: compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-database:10.2.1'
 Make sure you sync your project after adding it. Create the Model Let's model an article entity to be persisted to our realtime database. public class Article {

    public String title;
    public String author;

    public Article() {
        // Default constructor required for calls to DataSnapshot.getValue(Article.class)
    }

    public Article(String title, String author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
    }
} Create the XML Layout  Our XML layout for the main Activity will have just two EditTexts and just a button that will submit the new article. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout
        xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        tools:context="com.chikeandroid.tutsplusalerts.MainActivity"
        android:orientation="vertical">

    <EditText
            android:id="@+id/et_title"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:hint="Title"/>

    <EditText
            android:id="@+id/et_author"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:hint="Author"/>

    <Button
            android:id="@+id/btn_submit"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:hint="Submit"/>
</LinearLayout> Write to the Realtime Database Now we are going to write to the Realtime Database path /articles/. // ...
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    final FirebaseDatabase database = FirebaseDatabase.getInstance();

    final EditText titleEditText = (EditText)findViewById(R.id.et_title);
    final EditText authorEditText = (EditText)findViewById(R.id.et_author);
    Button submitButton = (Button)findViewById(R.id.btn_submit);
    submitButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onClick(View view) {
            DatabaseReference myRef = database.getReference("articles").push();
            Article article = new Article(titleEditText.getText().toString(),
                    authorEditText.getText().toString());
            myRef.setValue(article);
        }
    });
}
//... Your app will need write access to the database. For demo purposes only, you can set your Security Rules to permit all reads and writes. In a real application, you would never want to use such insecure security settings. {
  "rules": {
    ".read": "true",
    ".write": "true"
  }
} You can learn more about Firebase Security Rules in my post here on Envato Tuts+. Mobile Development Firebase Security Rules Chike Mgbemena Run the App At this stage, we can test the app and see if our Cloud Function was executed successfully. Enter a title and author, and then click the submit button. After that, visit the Functions dashboard and view the logs. Our custom log should appear. From the logs above, we see that we have successfully executed our Cloud Function and sent a message with a payload to devices subscribed to the 'android' topic, but no device has subscribed to the topic yet. In the next section, we'll use Firebase Cloud Messaging so that devices can subscribe to a topic and then process the incoming message from the server to show a notification.  3. Add Firebase Cloud Messaging Support Include the Dependency  Include the Firebase Messaging dependency to your build.gradle file and sync your project afterwards: compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:10.2.1' Handling Messages We need to create a service that extends FirebaseMessagingService and overrides the onMessageReceived callbacks.  package com.chikeandroid.tutsplusalerts;

import com.google.firebase.messaging.FirebaseMessagingService;
import com.google.firebase.messaging.RemoteMessage;

import android.app.NotificationManager;
import android.app.PendingIntent;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.media.RingtoneManager;
import android.net.Uri;
import android.support.v4.app.NotificationCompat;

public class MyFirebaseMessagingService extends FirebaseMessagingService {

    @Override
    public void onMessageReceived(RemoteMessage remoteMessage) {

        // Check if message contains a data payload.
        if (remoteMessage.getData().size() > 0) {
            showNotification(remoteMessage.getData().get("title"), remoteMessage.getData().get("author"));
        }

        // Check if message contains a notification payload.
        if (remoteMessage.getNotification() != null) {

        }
    }

    private void showNotification(String title, String author) {
        Intent intent = new Intent(this, MainActivity.class);
        intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);
        PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0 /* Request code */, intent,
                PendingIntent.FLAG_ONE_SHOT);

        Uri defaultSoundUri= RingtoneManager.getDefaultUri(RingtoneManager.TYPE_NOTIFICATION);
        NotificationCompat.Builder notificationBuilder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(this)
                .setContentTitle("New Article: " + title)
                .setSmallIcon(R.mipmap.ic_launcher)
                .setContentText("By " + author)
                .setAutoCancel(true)
                .setSound(defaultSoundUri)
                .setContentIntent(pendingIntent);

        NotificationManager notificationManager =
                (NotificationManager) getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);

        notificationManager.notify(0 /* ID of notification */, notificationBuilder.build());
    }
} In the above code, we are also getting the data payload and showing it in a notification regardless of whether the application is in a foreground or background state.   Update the Manifest File Update the manifest file, including the service created earlier inside the <application> tag. //..
<service
    android:name=".MyFirebaseMessagingService">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT"/>
    </intent-filter>
</service>
//... Subscribe to a Topic Finally, we need to subscribe to the topic 'android' so that the device can receive and process messages sent to that topic.  /...
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    // ...
    FirebaseMessaging.getInstance().subscribeToTopic("android");
    // ...
}
//... Run the App  Run the app for the second time and enter a title and an author, and then click the submit button. This time, a notification will show up whenever a new article is posted to the database by any app user. To do this before Cloud Functions, you would have needed an HTTP or XMPP server, which would mean more code to write, as well as a server to set up and support. Conclusion In this tutorial, you learned about Cloud Functions for Firebase: what they are, why you might need them, and how to get started using Cloud Functions for your app. Be aware that Cloud Functions for Firebase is still in public beta as of this writing.  To learn more about Cloud Functions for Firebase, do refer to the official documentation.

Google Assistant's new shopping list is live, here's how it works Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/10 7:00pm PDTApr 10, 2017 58 Plus 1 on G+ 99 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares231 Applications Google News When Google Assistant was first introduced, you could ask it to add items to your personal shopping list. This would create a note called 'Google Assistant shopping list' in Google Keep, and you could easily manage your list from the Keep app (or web app). It makes sense that your shopping list would be in the same app as your notes, right? Apparently not to Google, because two days ago, a support article was updated to say the shopping list is moving out of Keep. Why? Because the new list ties into Google Express, so you can order what you need in fewer steps. That doesn't make the change any less stupid, but that's the reason.    When you ask Assistant to add something to your list, it is now added to the Google Express shopping list. You can actually have multiple shopping lists, and set any of them as the default. You can also share lists with other Google accounts, and they can easily add or remove items (which was a bit buggy with Keep lists). You might notice that some items (like the Vitamin Water in the above screenshot) have a tiny umbrella icon. When you tap it, it will link you to the product on Google Express. I guess that's useful? But there are some major problems with this implementation too. Unless you have the Google Express app installed, your shopping list is opened in a Chrome Custom Tab. Google could have easily added this to the Google app, but they didn't. One of my favorite aspects of the Keep list was being able to check items off with my watch (through the Android Wear Keep app). Even if you have the Express app installed, there's no way to access the list from Android Wear. In addition, adding items to the shopping list through Google Now still adds them to Keep. So in summary, the new shopping list implementation is two steps forward, one step back. Feel free to vent your frustration in the comments below.

Stupid move. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's my main problem with this. I used the shopping list for non-online purchases, while this clearly oriented for online shopping. Todd Johnson Agreed... So I can go grocery shopping and tick stuff off! Marilyndivey Google is paying $97 per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !ft223c: On monday I got a great new mclaren f1 from having earned $12778 this last four weeks.. 3 to 5 hours of work a day...

Chris Sanner It's okay. I'm plenty ticked off. Teja Common, Its just an option. You can ignore it completely but removing keep integration is something we need to worry about. akshay7394 That's his point, though. Removing keep integration made it much harder to use for anybody that uses this primarily for grocery (read: *offline*) shopping javier rodriguez I vow here and now to Never purchase an item from Google Express... Unless they add YouTube red to the stupid yearly charge. whispy_snippet Never even heard of Google Express because it's not actually available in Australia. So now my Google Assistant shopping list in Keep has been gimped because... no reason at all. Todd Johnson That's what I thought when I was reading this article... What the F@&% is Google Express, look it up and yeah good work Google, change a feature that people use to something that people don't use... They are releasing the Google Home in the UK and it doesn't look like Google Express is available there? So what, UK users won't be able to use the feature? I bought a Google Home about 1.5weeks ago and am waiting for it to arrive. Yay! Upon reading the below comments, I suppose we could name a list as Coles list or Woolies List... But that is such a stupid work around! EDIT: And it's a monthly subscription!!!! "Google Express membership is $10/month or $95/year after your trial." - https://www.google.com/express/u/0/about Alex To be honest, the only difference for those of us without Express is that it opens up the shopping list in Chrome instead of Keep. That's a bit disadvantageous, but I'm also the only person I know that even knows Keep exists, let alone uses it, so nothing will significantly change. It's a weird move to tie it to this app/service that isn't even available in the region that they just launched Home in, though. I don't really follow why, if they were going to do anything, they didn't just make it a part of the Google Home app itself. All they've done is remove one bodge of tying it to another app/service and changed it to another bodge of tying it to another app/service - except this app can't even be downloaded here... akshay7394 > That's a bit disadvantageous, but I'm also the only person I know that even knows Keep exists, let alone uses it, so nothing will significantly change. I strongly disagree. What about offline-syncing? This current implementation always opens a chrome custom tab. I, for example, would always use it such that I'd note what I needed and then, later, refer to Keep (which has it sync'd offline) to see and check-off what I need and bought. Alvar Lagerlof It is possible till make offline websites. But they haven't Alex I'd assume the app previously opened Keep up in a browser too if you didn't have it installed (which would seem to be more common than not, from my anecdotal experience) - so for a lot of people it won't be any different. It's surprising that they wouldn't use Chrome's offline ability though. Has anyone actually tested it to find out? xxTheGoDxx Google Keep has 100 to 500 million users... tabguy2 Since that's the "only difference" what you're saying is that I'll still be able to see the list on my Android Wear watch? demarcmj FWIW, the price is competitive with Amazon Prime. That doesn't solve the availability issue of course. Cory S Prime offers a whole lot more than shipping. Express doesn't even scratch the surface of product availability, or benefits. If they tossed in Red, and Play Music, it be somewhat comparable...but even then. demarcmj Some people may find the overnight or sometimes same day delivery outweighs or at least balances the difference in number of products. Plus, you can get groceries from this, which Amazon charges extra for and doesn't even have competitive prices on. I'd say for the shipping aspect at least, the services both have pros and cons and which one is "better" would depend on the needs of the person. I'll give you the fact that Prime has a bunch of other services bundled in with it, but I suspect that a large percentage of people don't even use those. Cory S Express doesn't offer any perishable good on the grocery front...So it's of limited use there. Amazon doesn't charge extra for prime now which includes far more in the grocery selection area. It just has a minimum purchase price of 20 dollars. However, it does have a tip suggestion (which is optional) which I find annoying. PAY YOUR DRIVERS AMAZON. demarcmj All true... although Prime Now is only available in a small number of major cities. My point in comparing it to prime was simply directed at Todd Johnson's incredulity that "it's a monthly subscription!!!!" (four exclamation points). Of course it's a monthly subscription! bekifft Do yourself a favor and return it / cancel the order while you can. Jon Edge I would demand my money back. Oh wait... whispy_snippet Ha, well played. xxTheGoDxx Nor in Germany, nor anywhere else outside the US. OK Google, WTF? h4rr4r You know how hard it is to make services work upside down? It takes time. MatchstickMan Great, now my shopping list isn't easily accessible by the Keep widget on one of my home screens and I now have to open Home, click the sidebar menu, then select shopping list and wait for the Chrome tab to load up! Thanks, Google! rh I just tell Google to remind me next ti e I'm at a Walmart to get bread coffee razors and if I think of other stuff I tell Google again to remind me to get shaving cream ,surgery and milk, then when I pull into said parking lot I get a text reminder of what I need,..boom done and done Hayden Pearce > "and if I think of other stuff I tell Google again to remind me to get shaving cream ,surgery and milk" "OK, Google. Remind me to get surgery." rh :) MatchstickMan That's a nice workaround, but obviously not ideal... Cory S Meh, those location based reminders seem to work 1 out of 5 times for me, and in this case it isn't that useful if it did work. If I am at the store I don't need to be reminded I have a list...I need a good list app that ideally is shareable and syncs with the person shopping with me. Teja "Okay Google, show me my shopping list" should work though. Anyways I also prefer Keep integration as the list can be a shared list. MatchstickMan Ah shit, using voice assistant? That's actually a pretty good point, I'll keep that in mind. Teja Damn! you're good at sarcasm. I just gave you an alternative for "I now have to open Home, click the sidebar menu, then select shopping list and wait for the Chrome tab to load up!" I do agree that a Google Keep widget is a simpler way to access the list rather than a voice command. Especially when you have people around, as it would be awkward to talk to your phone. :P MatchstickMan Haha! I really didn't mean for it to come off as maliciously sarcastic as I'm now reading it. I sincerely never considered it! nside1 The Google app (Google search box widget) still allows me to add items to my Google keep shopping list, will that change? Corbin Davenport No idea. Nicolas Finn From the article: "In addition, adding items to the shopping list through Google Now still adds them to Keep." David Hyman Hopefully this evolves quickly into something great. Adding a widget and launcher shortcuts should make getting there very easy. And if this allows me to better manage the items on my list I'm all in. I really want to be able to ask is peanut butter on my list and have assistant say "yes" instead of just reading me my entire list Grey So "hope all the lost functionality is restored"? David Hyman Yep, pretty much all of us can hope for at this point dylan-m Of course, not living in the United States, I don't have the Google Express app. (Not that most people do anyway). So I get the dumb website instead. First thing I notice is you can add other lists. Interesting. And yet if I say "add foo to my to do list" it adds to a new list in Google Keep anyway. So apparently this feature only applies to lists with names like "shopping list." Brilliant, Google. Top notch interface design, as ever. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard Google services killed the first born children of the Google Assistant team. That's why they don't like integrating with Google services. It's personal for them. Booyabobby I rather the list stay on Keep. supersanborn The original clunky approach of being unable to use an existing keep shopping lift has been made clunkier. Guess I'll keep not using this feature. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I used Keep because it was really useful for grocery shopping in the usual supermarket. Grey Nope you have to buy from Google Express. Also, not telling you what Google Express is. newtonfb God dammit. I'm going to get slammed with messages tomorrow from friends and family asking what's going on and why did they change it....And I have no answer for them. I really do hate Google when they do shit like this. Already give us the option to keep using Keep. bozzykid I guess Google is really desperate to push Google Express that they don't care how terrible it makes Google Assistant. Great job Google! Nick I never understood why it was in keep in the first place so this makes more sense. pfmiller Because Keep is meant for keeping notes and lists. Seems pretty obvious to me. Who on Earth would think to go to the Google Home app for their shopping list? Paul_Werner Meh, I'll stick to Flipp for my shopping list/coupons/grocery store maps Hypnotoad I don't think I've been this pissed with Google since Allo... What the hell!? I don't want to use Google Express, I never signed up for it and I don't have the app, please put my shopping list back in Google keep!!! I can add to my keep shopping list via Google now, but not the assistant, what the hell is wrong with this!? Sir_Brizz Two steps sideways, two steps back. Seth Merritt Should be one step forward, two steps back. Hexlattice It's like it's not even forward at all... One step to the side, one fall down a cliff. m-p{3} If I can't use Google Keep to manage that list on a desktop and more importantly make it shared with a relative living in the same HOME, then Google fucked up. ngwoo I love it when something called an "assistant" stops providing assistance. This is probably the stupidest change Google ever made - at least let us choose which list to use. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Being an Android Site you guys should be used to Google going 2 steps forward and 1 step back. It's called Job Security. Marty McWong Just as an aside, are many Nexus 5X/6P owners are still waiting for Assistant to roll out? I've yet to receive it, and if it makes a difference I'm on 7.1.2 (via the beta), no root and with an apparently up to date (7.6.08...) Play Store... Grey Check your settings Marty McWong Oh, re-reading the original AP article (http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/02/google-assistant-coming-android-6-0-devices/) I see they mention checking language settings... Mine is set to English UK, so that's probably it (I'll check after work), thanks! Grey "Can't we just add Google Express support to Keep?" "You're fired." create812 Get your logic out of here! Kevin Sword relevant CoffeeZombie I like Keep. I have a shared shopping list on Keep with my wife. We can both add things to it and take things off that we've bought. We both have access to it at the store. I could use it from my watch while at the store, which was always nice. Google Now knew how to add items to this shared list, too. It was super convenient. "Oh, we're out of milk! Okay, Google, add milk to my shopping list." Done! Then Assistant came. I tried adding an item to the shopping list...and it created a new Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. WTF? I already have a shopping list, that's what I want to use. So, basically, I guess this doesn't affect me at this point because I've already had my nice, voice-activated shopping list taken away from me. I'll just stick with manually adding things in Keep and remembering back in 2004 when Google was cool... Rob Using Voice Search (Google Now) you can still add items to Keep! Abhimanyu Seth Since I found wunderlist, never looked at another app for shopping lists! Jose Romero More renewed focus on Google Express. This gives me a little bit more hope that Google might one day make a "Google Prime" that at least includes Google Express, Google Movies, and Google Music in the yearly subscription cost. Wynnded Keep app just got an update, lol. James Briano "OK, Google, add an iPhone to my shopping list." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No kidding. I'm getting more and more tempted to switch. Indefinite Implosion As someone with a work iPhone and only a Nexus 4 that has no SIM and little battery, don't. I miss Android. There's so many things about Android that I miss and have no good replacement for (such as Nine mail for Exchange). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ My kids have iPhones and I think they're terrific. I'd be happy with one, only I really like the S Pen too much to switch. But if Google pisses me off enough, I will switch. JD Do it you'll feel better, way less frustrated. Portzblitz You CAN'T use Google Express in about 5,292 US cities, sooo.. Is the wisdom of this intentionally hidden from us, or does this really, truly do no one- including Google- any good? b_boogey_xl *rabble rabble rabble* this one change ruins everything. how will I go on with life, my shopping list is ruined… *rabble rabble rabble* 🙄 disqus_3Gy5bmHRAv Yet another example of Google's haphazard policies towards apps. Android has become a complete frustration. The apps work differently on different devices, an app can be killed off at any minute based on a whim and important apps do not get enough attention because of Google's philosophy: Try everything, master nothing. Teja I need an option to add tasks to a to do list in keep through Google Assistant. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher R.I.P. shopping with my watch :-( http://i.imgur.com/RuHrQnK.jpg There is still a way, much more complicated: 1. Make sure NOT to install Google Express 2. Open shopping list on the phone 3. Select all → Copy 4. Open Google Keep 5. Create new list 6. Paste 7. Remove extra line spacing → Now you can still use your watch in the store. Thank you Google. DragoCubed It makes total sense for a shopping list to be in keep. Google is trying to make itself a mess. I shouldn't be used to this Google, I shouldn't be afraid to recommend a Google messaging app. James Bray I am in the UK, and I'm not able to download the Google Express App, so I need to use the website. This wouldn't be the end of the world if I could get any mobile service in my local supermarket! With this change, they effectively just removed this feature from me entirely. I only set it up on the 6th because that's when the Home came out! Annoyed! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher See my other comment, you can still copy/paste the list to Keep Tamil Arasan A new assistant for me making things simple!!! Stefan Weißhampel It's a stupid move, especially for international users who simply use the US assistant because it is a few steps ahead of the several international versions. I'm not going to order eggs from the US. Empraim can the new shopping list give me location based notifications like Keep could? It was the best feature that my phone would buzz, giving me my shopping list as I entered the supermarket Filipe Santos They make a move thinking on everyone but in the end Google Express only exist on a very very few countries.... Filipe Santos Ok Google stop being an asshole and release Google assistant for everyone myssi How about they had updated Google Keep to have a little Google Express badge on any list item buyable from express while person in supported country and zip area?? Now even on saying "Create a list" on Google Assitant makes a Google Express list -___- Chicachica Wow what a load of crap, they took an awesome feature and instead of improving it, made it much worse. I sent feedback in the apps. Hopefully when enough people bitch like that they will change it back... Jason Pagliaro Sent detailed feedback as well. Unlikely that we'll see any change but worth a shot. Crossstick Ten thumbs down. It was perfect as a Keep interface. Now we have to manually enter items in a Keep shopping list. Brilliant, Google. Albert R I think you got that reversed: this is one step forward, two steps back. Albert R Just like killing of reader, the Hangouts chrome extension, and when they stopped using xmpp for chat. They really need better product direction/someone with common sense. makapav You're giving them too much credit - they actually lack any product direction. David Dalrymple This was not a well - thought decision. I hope Google rethinks this decision. bdbplatano Google is the dumbest smart company out there Martin Send your ANGRY thoughts to Google from the Assistant's FEEDBACK :-))) Let them know at least how much they SUCK... :-))) P.S: Don't expect change, it's not like Google ever gives a sh*t about their users... They are just dumb and ignorant most of the time :) makapav Feedback? I have up on it years ago. All that Hangouts feedback went to shit. They came up with Allo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Obvious attempt to get you to shop using Google Express instead of Amazon. SavageJeep and... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And it won't work. All this will do is piss off people who used Keep for shopping lists. SavageJeep I use Express. I use Amazon. Ordering stuff off my list makes sense. That is their intent and yes it is a business decision. EDIT: spelling Bodah My biggest complaint is that you can no longer reorder the list. In my usage, I would add items throughout the week, and then reorder the list based on the layout of the store before I left. That way I wouldn't be going from one end of the store to the other because I happened to add grapes at the end of the week. demarcmj You realize that's not an "umbrella icon" right? Graham Newman I was already disliking the way that assistant added reminders were not added to keep. But im a new convert from iOS. I thought keep was great at keeping reminders gathered in one place rather than spread all over my calendar but I just need to try to get used to it. I don't like the cal app much. Metal_Link Disappointed for the same reason as the author... Can't see my list on my watch. Ugh. Navarr Barnier two forward, one back? This is more like one forward two back. Aaron Dishman https://giphy.com/gifs/superstore-lauren-ash-26ueYRXkmpTVsB7K8 Kakairo It looks like I can share the list if I view it in a web browser, but not when I view it in Google Express. The hell? This was one of our most used features in the house, it will take a lot of getting used to. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Google giveth and the Google taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Google. (This change is a transparent attempt to compete with Amazon.) create812 What is Google Express? Why can't I see my list on my watch? Why can't I check items off? How can my SO and I collaborate on the same shopping list? Oh no Google WHAT! is you doing? Roberto Virga "... have a tiny umbrella icon" From "don't be evil" to "resident evil": Google has now become Umbrella Corp. :D JD I can imagine the Google Lunch room now. You got different cliques sitting at different tables. None of them are allowed to sit in different cliques, you sit with your own and that's it. You got the G-Home Table, The Android Table, Android Wear table etc, G-Apps. Each one planning how to shank the other like in a prison. Then you have the guys who are in charge of Adopting Material design in to G-Apps walking around outside like giant chickens pecking at the ground crowing randomly at passerbys. Roy So they're basically removing the two things that I love about using keep for this: Android Wear Sharing the list with my wife (her phone has yet to get google assistant and neither of us can get the Google Express app). Good job Google. It must be nice to be able to consistently ignore and piss off your users because we're not really your customers, your advertisers are. Well, I hope one day you realize that your products will move to greener pastures when a company comes around that can do what you do but doesn't see us as widgets to be sold to advertisers, but as people that are the foundation of your income. Advertisers won't pay you a dime if you have no one to show their ads to! Cecil Hardwood Why are you guys surprised or disappointed ? This is Google. Look at messaging and reminders. Those are all over the place too. Google is becoming more and more incompetent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome sucks now. It used to be my favorite browser. Unfortunately, there's no competition anymore. Edge sucks more. Firefox works great but is slow as fark. Opera is great, but it's based on Chrome. Merf This is as bad as it sounded. Vons Records Good move, Google. Now I'm back to having zero reasons to interact with the assistant. Except for telling it to shut up when it overhears me setting up the backup phone I use for flashing ROMs. R.J. Great, no widget for Express as well, so my shopping list isn't viewable with all my other notes on my home screen. Glich damit i use a extra home screen of my phone as one big keep wigget for my shopiing list. o well so much for that David Lloyd Thomas Sucks because Google Express isn't available in the UK! No way of accessing the list without adding something to it 😕😕 Jon Edge Maybe this has already been posted...I didn't read all the comments. I'm not saying this will solve everyone's issues, but it's at least a work around I can live with. Once the list is launched, you can pin it to your homescreen. That makes it easily accessible, As a matter of fact, it's one step shorter than accessing through Keep (unless you keep that list open all the time). Just now, I copied the address of that Chrome Tab and emailed that to myself. I launched that link on Chrome on my desktop and now I have that bookmarked in my Bookmarks Bar. Pretty easy access to my list on mobile and desktop. I can live with that. Who cares if they have integrated this new list with Google Express. Use it or don't. That really shouldn't be an issue for anyone. I'll bet this is only temporary anyway and that eventually this finds its way into the Google Home app (or somewhere else). LondonLeedsFan Is Google Express their attempt at Prime then? I wouldn't know as don't think it's in the UK. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes. They want to compete with Amazon Prime because you can order stuff with the Amazon Echo. h4rr4r I don't understand the issue here. Just use keep, who the heck wants to yell at their phone? surethom No express in the UK & cellular signel In supermarkets is very bad so shopping list DOES NOT work in UK as it uses a web link, we NEED an offline sync version. xxTheGoDxx So, summarize: Google relies now on app not available outside of the US Express doesn't work on Android Wear, nor tablets from what I have read. You can instead open your shopping list in Chrome, which means you won't have access to it if the page / app reloads or you miss click unless you have a working data connection in your local grocery store / super market. Good job guys! BTW, when does your next totally useless messaging app launch? And have you ever thought about moving the ability to take selfies into Google Keep instead of the camera app? That would be so cool. thereasoner Perhaps Wear support is coming shortly?

Sony Xperia Home beta updated with full Google Now integration Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2016/06/29 10:07am PDTJun 29, 2016 71 Plus 1 on G+ 117 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares188 News Sony Sony isn't making the most compelling Android phones these days, but it does at least try to put out good software. It's one of the most developer-friendly OEMs and it was even the first to release the N preview on non-Nexus hardware. Now, Sony has the distinction of being the first to do something else. The latest version of the Xperia Home beta has a Google Now pane just like the Google Now Launcher—no other OEM has done this on its custom launcher. To give this a shot, you need to have a recent Xperia phone (exact models not listed). It's an open beta that anyone can join by visiting this link from the phone. A toast message will appear at the bottom of the screen to confirm your participation in the beta. The updated home screen should install on your device shortly thereafter. This seems like a weird way to do things, but okay. If you want to leave the beta, you'll have to use this link from the phone. Here's everything Sony says it has changed in the new version. After listening to Beta feedback, search bar in application tray is now transparent. Added notification badge support for Facebook & Facebook messenger. Fixed legacy support for notification badges on Kitkat and Lollipop for Xperia Messaging, Telephony & Email. It is now possible to add Google Now on the -1 pane (enabled from Home Settings). Bug fixes and tweaks The big news here is obviously Google Now on the home screen. Sony's launcher defaults to using the center panel as the "main" one, just like stock Android used to do back in the day. Turning on Google Now in the launcher settings will move your main screen to the left side, then you can swipe left once to access Google Now. It looks and works exactly like it does in the Google Now Launcher. Google hasn't made any tools for Google Now publicly available, which is why no third-party launchers have a Google Now panel. It's not clear if Sony just got something special from Google, or maybe all OEMs have the option of doing this and none of them have bothered yet. Whatever the situation, Sony is the only company to add Google Now support in this way. It's worth checking out if you've got an Xperia.

(HIMYM) Lukas Actually they're not the first. This appeared in trebuchet in cm11. It wasn't perfect, but Google now launcher slower back then. Sashank Narayan That was different. It used the same method that other launchers like Nova and Action use for calling the Google Now screen, the caveat being that there was a slight delay, the transition wasn't smooth and you couldn't slide left to go back to the homescreen, you'd have to use the home button. https://youtu.be/uuSimvcMZuM Christopher Bement All CM's and Action Launcher's solution does is open the Google app. It's literally just a launcher shortcut which is gesture activated in most cases. russjr08 Yeah, that's what he was pointing out. Christopher Bement Indeed, and it needed some clarification which is why I chimed in. Luqmaan Mathee Actually you could slide back to the home screen. It didn't always work, but it did if you tried it a second time. rgao007 So it was a gesture that launched the Google app? Sashank Narayan Yes, the same swipe gesture used in the Google Now Launcher. Except the Google Now panel is integrated in that launcher, so it slides in smoothly, whereas other launchers open the Google app with a noticeable stutter. grizzlyjon83 I really hope we hear more about how this came about. My optimistic side is hopeful that this is the beginning of Google Now being opened up a little bit. ikjadoon Hmm...optimistic, but not so much. Aren't big features like that announced at I/O? Maybe in 2017 or 2018? Adrián Iriarte Very good improvemnt. Dont force to use but make the option available to the user jstew182 The Google Now launcher is also opt in on this function. Roh_Mish Sony has been good about making all changes an option. this will be an option too. MrTheenD Wow Sony, I'm impressed. jcopernicus Google should just replace the whole android team with sony's team. Christopher Bement Don't jump the gun yet, we need to know how their messaging people work. Messenger, Hangouts, Allo, Duo, Gvoice, all of them need a look! Denigrate Why? rgao007 hahahahahahaha NO rgao007 I would love to see this on the HTC launcher. Anonymous Neverevereverever with blinkfeed Kwetsima Maluleke You see now this is what I'd also like to see on TouchWiz. Ankit Gupta I hope Nova gains this functionality soon enough! Eric Braun Hopefully! jstew182 This is the only thing that keeps me from using Nova as my daily launcher. demarcmj Same Protoss because pressing that search bar on top of the launcher to invoke Google Now is too difficult i guess right? Eric Braun Doesn't have to do with a degree of difficulty, more of just the fluidity of being able to swipe. Anonymous It looks super ugly even on trebuchet, the animations and the time for the keyboard to pop up is super intolerable.

Arshdeep Singh Saini Exactly, its exclusive to the Google Now Launcher and the biggest reason to use it. Michael M.

Dibyajyot I am also waiting for that.I am using google now launcher only for Google now tab :( Ygor Cortes Now make this happen on Nova... Yury H Fingers crossed Action Launcher 3 implements this as well :D John Kevin Villar time to decode from sony phones i guess. Dominic81 If you'll get a Xperia, get the latest true great Xperia: the Z5. The Xperia X is a sad joke. Same for the X Performance Damodara Kovie [dkovie] Or Z5 Compact. That's also a great option. I like the smaller form factor. 😊 Hyung-Woo Jung Sad to hear the Xperia X lineup is not up to par with other releases this year. Thankfully I'm very happy with my Z5 Compact. John Kevin Villar sony xperia x line is great! I guess you never have one. haha Dominic81 No it's not. The Xperia X line is a sad joke and the pricing is even worse. Start using your critical thinking and stop hugging Sony's nuts buddy. The X Performance is more expensive than a Galaxy S7 Edge. That doesn't make sense, at all Roberto M. Vázquez Is the apk working on no-sony devices?? blackroseMD1 Doesn't install on my Nexus 6. Espen Flagtvedt Olsen You can find a flash able zip.

Hopefully ActionLauncher or Nova will pick this up. Than we will have the "perfect" launcher experience on Android. *_* Portzblitz I agree! "Perfect". I will be a perfect 100% satisfied with my phone & launcher setup for the first time ever if Nova gets to play with this code. *not that I'm exactly miserable right now or anything; I'm actually feeling a pretty happy 99% with Nova 😀 onstrike112 While a cool novelty, I'd disable it, and if I couldn't, I'd switch to a different launcher. I can touch an icon or say "okay Google" if I want Google Now. But choice is the benefit to Android. I can use BlackBerry's launcher on a BlackBerry Priv, just like how anyone could choose any other launcher to use all the same. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] Yes, there's a toggle in the launcher's settings. onstrike112 Good to know. Aashish bhatia Someone tag the Nova's developer here. John Kevin Villar and ? they can get the code from here? Wolf0491 Awesome! And it is indeed an option for those asking. Got it installed on my Z3 Spencer Weird. I have the same version on my Z3, but I'm not seeing that option. Maybe it's because I'm running the Android N preview? Wolf0491 Well you do need to have Google cards enabled in google now settings I think Gaurav Arora Google make next Nexus with Sony !! Martin Nilsson I use Google's launcher on my N9 and Sony's on my Z3 and now it almost looks and feels the same. Lots can be said about Sony and their phones, but software (and updates) were the reason I got my Xperia. The changes made in this beta just further that point . world Ads Net Amazing federico rebechi I use the swipe up gesture to open it on Nova. Is pretty much the same.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 134 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares270 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company. I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

Indian Yes we guessed him to be the new man by reading his name, Trevor "Newman" Marcie Mtz Good article...But it's "couldn't care less". chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine CF542 6 months? I replaced my S7E three times in four months for chronic and various problems before giving up and going Pixel blueman24 "Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES." "I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge" "Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months." You brought a $700 S7edge and not a $300 oneplus, so it should not be acceptable for it to become less responsive after 6 months? Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. WARLORD VIII On the up side the Pixel isn't catching on fire 😎 das I thought that was a feature for survivalists. :P Eric Works for me. The most stable software wise of any phone I've ever used. Paid 300 for mine and prefer it over the s7. Curved screens don't like screen protector. Nothing like water resistant on a phone that looks like a cat danced on it. Another huge plus is the lack of carrier spam. I'm not getting all the complaints. Google showed us we'd be getting if we choose to buy it. I for one have no regrets about doing so. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. Kristian Ivanov I'm not going to comment on the actual design, I want to hear thoughts comparing it to the undesputed legend - Nexus 5 (design only) JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. CF542 The only thing that the S7/S8 truly suffer from is having Samsung as a parent. They turned the phone (s) into a piece of bloatware full of crappy software that nobody wants. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Ryan Those are usability preferences. I will agree the settings are a freaking nightmare to find, but I dont go into settings often. Right now, and for over a year now, bluetooth audio has been straight-up broken. They implemented that absoloute volume BS without coding how to handle devices that dont send volume information, breaking it in my car. Then the idiots put developer setting that is to allow you to disable it but they didnt even test it and the user doesnt have permissions to change that setting, so the switch does nothing. That is a BIG bug, and one that Google has refused to address for over a year. Then there is the fact that my phone, and the first Nexus phone I have had to deal with this on, has to be rebooted every few weeks because it slows down horribly. Jack Smith Based on what? Had every iPhone since the 3G and relatively recently added Android as carry both and Android is excellent. So much is written is just simply not true. Suggest actually give recent Android a try and you might be surprised ;). Ryan Ive had android for coming up on 8 years, HTC Hero was the first, then one more HTC before going Nexus. Been on Nexus and still am with my 5x. I know, personally, some of the MAJOR shortcomings of Googles implementation of Android. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. ScratchC The problem with the Internet is how do I know you actually own one? Or are you just a troll. In any case, I unfortunately had to pass on the Pixel my S6 shit the bed and I had just upgraded to the S7. My gf tho.. I somehow convinced her to grab a Pixel on Verizon. She has not had not 1 issue. I'm not saying they don't exist. It's just not as bad as commenters trying to win an argument make it seem. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of the 22 Pixel photos had halos. None of the LG G6 photos had halos. whispy_snippet Wow. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. Vega007 My Pixel is, by far, the best phone I have ever had for battery life. Christopher Bement I'm only going with devices I've actually used, I haven't touched a Pixel personally. All I can say is it's day and night between the N6 and S7 on a given work day where I'm calling, texting and emailing almost constantly. Vega007 That's a good point, it all depends on what phone we have used to compare it to. I have never used a S7 Edge, but I have used a S7. While the battery life was fine, the Pixel does do better for my usage (I'm using the 5" btw). And that's the real key to battery issue is personal use. We all use our devices differently so battery life will always be subjective. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. ScratchC The iPhone has been in trouble for some time. It's why it started playing catch up (Forget current sales up to now. Poll after poll, iPhone users are bored of iPhones) Actually Google's Android is in trouble as well. Samsung is doing their own thing. Google needs to put it's foot down or compete. The Pixel is an attempt to do so. It's not perfect by any means. it's better than nothing and it was a solid first entry. If you simply don't like it.. Buy elsewhere. that's the beauty of Android. I think you guys forget, that out of our fanboy bubble, most people when they think of Android have a distinct definition. I'm talking the average consumer...they think Android = cheap phone from prepaid carrier that's slow, plastic, horrible camera & full of bugs. Or.. Android = Samsung Galaxy. Your average consumer still doesn't know what a Pixel is nvm that they don't even know what a Nexus was. Android phones need to be a premium product to compete. They need to charge the amount of money it takes for proper R&D.. Customer support etc. Google cannot sell at a loss and accomplish this. This very reason is why Samsung holds the Android crown. Regardless of your opinion towards their devices. Remember that Carrier subsidizing is how Galaxy devices sell by the millions. Iphones as well. Google is on the right path. They just need to bring the next Pixel to all carriers. Lindsay Meyer You're right. I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved those iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices), and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick (and their new iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to throw my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability, and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. mrjayviper Fairly new? How long have they been selling Nexus phones and other devices? MJ Let me get this straight... You left a comment without reading the whole discussion? I already very clearly laid out an actual argument but thanks for your input. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. madcanada That's correct, I'm pissed that Pixel gets a better camera software while Nexus is fundamentally the same in the department. I understand your point about camera being a combination of both hardware and software, but unlike, say, Apple, where each iteration is actually better in terms of hardware, and older iPhones still get whatever features they can physically run, Google decided to accentuate the difference by simply denying their last year phone the same updates. Where Apple only denies updates when the old phone can't actually handle them Google is simply abandoning their last year model to justify the price of the Pixel. whispy_snippet Except there's one key difference. Unlike iPhones that release each year, the Nexus 6P is not of the Pixel lineage. The Pixel is the first of its kind. madcanada That makes not a shred of difference in the argument I'm making. I find denying last year phone updates it perfectly capable of running, so you can justify the price of the new phone ethically questionable. I don't care if they rebranded, their decision to not give Nexus the updates it can handle is only guided by the fact that they wanted to charge twice the price for Pixel, and they couldn't have if Nexus got the goodies. whispy_snippet Ethically questionable? No, mate, it's business. Google's ultimate responsibility is maximising profits for shareholders. You're cranky that your 6P can't do what the more expensive a Pixel can do. Now imagine how Pixel owners would feel if they saw cheaper, older phones from the same company doing exactly the same thing as theirs. Again, I sympathise to an extent, but ultimately you get what you pay for. If you want the Pixel experience, buy it. madcanada I'm not cranky because my Nexus 6P can't do things Pixel can, on the contrary, I get full Pixel experience with free unlimited full size photo upload, Pixel launcher, Pixel camera, and day one Google Assistant on Nexus 6P. I'm cranky because I need to go to XDA to get them goodies. I understand it's business, but if you want to sell charge twice for the phone - sell a better phone, give us a better camera, bigger battery life, and don't downgrade our goddamn speakers. whispy_snippet Mate, you're simply not making sense anymore. You're effectively wanting something for nothing. You want Google to give you a Pixel quality camera experience on an older, less expensive phone from an entirely different lineage - for free. You're not entitled to free stuff. I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree. madcanada you can disagree all your want, i outlined my gripe with Google in the first post, then you decided to argue about the camera. New lineage or not, when you market Nexus as the phone that gets all the Google love, and then you just leave users behind right next generation simply to justify the price hike of new Pixel - that's low. Apple's feature fragmentation is driven solely by the hardware - newer phones get new exclusive features because older models can't do the same thing physically. Google is creating artificial fragmentation in order to justify twice the price. That's not the Google I remember and that's not the direction I like. Obviously it's their choice. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? Mix Sounds like you have not done this before because sending your phone to Google first, waiting for them to get it and look it over THEN sending a replacement is, 100%, the bad choice. Having them send you the phone first and put a hold on your creditcard is the better and faster choice! Complaining gets you nothing, USA got free daydream headsets, Canadians got nothing. The phone, after taxes, was $1,320.48 - close enough for me to complain about it at the $1,400 point, lol. John Doe OMG, YOU CAN'T READ? That is what I said Google does but you said you had to wait 7 days for your phone but they send you the phone first then you send yours in so no waiting. Yes I have done this before. With Apple, Google, and other companies...it is standard practice. No, they don't charge you taxes they just put a hold of the price of the phone not your total purchase price. Maybe it is just different in Canada...you should stop buying Google products there *rolls eyes* Lindsay Meyer If your damaged, soon-to-be-returned Pixel phone is broken and unusable, there would indeed be a waiting period to have a working phone in either case, because, being unable to easily switch your device at a physical brick and mortar store, you would be at the mercy of waiting for for Google's mailed replacement to have a working phone again. John Doe Google sens it next day here in the US Mix You straight up told me that I chose the bad option: "Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault." when I did not choose the bad option. If my phone bricked, which it did, and it takes 7 days for Googles phone to get to me I have no phone for 7 days, that is waiting without a phone! I think we are both right, 12 of this and a dozen of that, lol. <3 Stuff in Canada is more expensive and shipping generally sucks. I normally chose 2 day shipping with Amazon and get refunded shipping costs because the shipping companies miss the delivery date constantly. Nexus 4 and 5 have been sweet, my Pixel experience has been garbage. Their customer service has been good though so yay for that. Lindsay Meyer Canadian $ ≠ US $ John Doe Yeah but the phone still does not cost $1,400 in canada so yeah destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I'd far rather spend 5-10 minutes online from home getting my replacement shipped to me for free than having to go into a store, talk to someone who's less knowledgeable about my phone than I am, convince them to get it replaced, and then pay them an additional $35 to have them facilitate my phone then getting shipped to their store where I have to return to pick it up. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. Aaron Yeah, top notch. Tell that to all those iPhone 6plus users with the death screen disease and Apple does nothing... mrjayviper Out of warranty? I don't think Google supports out of warranty devices to donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. Berni Hargrove Hold on now, Chromebooks are more than good enough if you go price for price on a cheap laptop. There's no way that $200 Windows laptop with 2gigs of ram is performing on the same level as a $200 Chromebook with the same specs. In addition the reason why "Good Enough" applies to this is because the average person wants to pay very little for a computer, but have it be "fast and last a long time" to effectively browse and use Office. Anyone here should know, unless you are getting over on someone, the least you should pay for decent laptop is $500, but the amount of times I've had people in Best Buy whine that that's too expensive for them to just be using Office and small tasks is frequent. Google can make good products that are ready for primetime when they don't have their ass or in the clouds, but sadly as their messaging strategy has showed us, that's increasingly uncommon. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Eric Marciniak Doesn't help that Best Buy has a giant iPhone 7 ad that literally blocks the pixel display from view right when you walk in haha. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8283702e9d03a34df4cfb2bd525ea593d0304d3937690392b7b3acc57eb7620e.jpg Berni Hargrove Best Buy is terrible with product placement. Shit literally changes every season if not more. Good luck finding anything remotely niche on your own. lol Jon E. Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. Berni Hargrove While I agree with a lot of what you said, some of your logic is flawed. Take america for example. There's over 150 million people here. It would take at least 15 million in sales here alone, just to see 1 in 10 people with it. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers. C Lo Good first article Trevor. Welcome aboard. Suyash Bansal I liked the article. 🙃 Orjuan Google Pixels customer service is great if you ask me. It takes like a week to get a replacement, not a month. Also, comparing it to the One Plus 3T is unfair, you didn't mention the superior processing and graphical power and the fact that it gets updates for the next 5-8 years. It also features Google Assistant, which is a big selling point. Add all those up and pixel is worth the extra 400. Plus, I got a regular pixel, with a two year protection plan, 128 GB, and it's still cheaper than iPhone. Google Pixel is a commercial and consumer success. Do your research before spouting out shit, all you did was look at the obvious facts and ignored the small stuff that counts. "UGHHHHH, it has a better camera and that's it.". RESEARCH YOUR TOPICS, Google Pixel is $400 more than One Plus 3T because it's better! Orjuan Plus, Nexus was barely Google at all, they just supplied the best version of Android while hiring an OEM to make the parts and design, while slapping their logo on it. Nexus was good, but not Google's essence, it was a startup for Pixel, which is 100% Google. AJZ16 couldn't care less* usamaisawake I had an entire column of pixels that were not working properly. Thing is my Pixel arrived in the first shipment and I had to leave the country so I didn't umbox it until 4 weeks later. When I called to let them know, they were curious why I waited so long and I explained I hadn't turned it on till just then. They didn't give me any trouble with it and exchanged it right away. They sent the new phone and then after I received it I shipped the old back to them. Perhaps this was still early in the release of the phone so they felt more obligated to make sure the experience was good. Phil Rowley My pixel bricked. I thought Google's customer service (along with bestbuy even though I paid for their stupid geek squad) were horrible. I hate to say it but Verizon was the most helpful and luckily I pay for their monthly insurance. Colin Richardson I miss the Nexus line.. Thankfully I can still buy some Nexus 5X phones (not refurbished). But that will not last. I have no idea what I will do for a phone after that.. I want a Stock Android phone, not a Stock Android Flagship phone. Max Johnson There are plenty of stock-like flagship and non-flagship Android phones. HTC, Sony, Moto and OnePlus are all stock based at varying prices. If you want direct update from Google and good customer service that's a different story, I think that's the main thing now, to get the same quality of support as Apple on Android. I'm surprised to get frequently updates from Sony with latest monthly security patches on my X Compact. Micah T "couldn't* care less." Think about it.... Tr3ple I bought a Pixel XL for 370 and I threw my Galaxy S7 edge in the drawer LMAO 😂 oh Happy day. Sammy Phillips 370 USD? or 370 Euro? Tr3ple USD, bought it 220 with a broken screen and fixed it for 150. So I spent 370. mtz Interesting article however, in the same way Microsoft is not really trying to sell the overpriced Surface Studio , Google is not trying to sell Pixels. Why? Simple. Goole has OEM partners that have supported the Android platform by providing the hardware from the beginning. While it one thing for Google to partner with a carrier each year and release a basic Nexus phone its an entirely different thing for them to release top tier Device and undercut thoes partners on price. Tony Bundy Replied via non-existent really blue Pixel. Yes, wasn't easy but here I am. 😀 Pixel.ization.alism Well precisely Google Blue would be #4285F4 not #4485ED if you would ask. Zuxs13 This was a rather poor opinion piece. You make claims like you can't "easily get a replacement pixel" which is completely untrue. The Apple store is hardly the only place that sells phones and offers good customer service. The OP3T might be readily available, but most consumers have no clue what it is or where to even buy one and would rather buy a phone that is sold at their service provider or local best buy and is supported by 24/hr support service. das "Couldn't care less" - if one *could* care less, than it currently cares. Lindsay Meyer I mentioned this in another thread but feel it probably merits its own post here, coming from the perspective of a disenchanted iPhone user who now owns a Pixel (and is still disenchanted). I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved the iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices) and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick, or worse, new packaging on the same lipstick (and their upgraded iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to hurl my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's kind of a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have more innovative features, but Apple with come right behind it and perfect those features. That's what they do now. Still glad I didn't get the iPhone 7; Apple didn't deserve my business, but Pixel has been a disappointment to me thus far. For the price, I'd prefer my husband's Nexus 6. I think he'd prefer his old HTC if it had front-facing speakers lol. I just don't feel there's a lot of good options out there right now that justify the cost. I have given serious thought to trying to find a replacement comparable to the old Sanyo 6100 (yes, that one) and then throwing an iPad or a tablet in my purse. Maybe even that old B&O phone would be fun. I'm just tired of my need for a smartphone to be continually exploited by these inferior products; half the time they break right after the warranty expires, and like an endentured servant, I'm forced into the process all over again. Also, the fact that this Pixel wants to track everything I do scares the bejeezus out of me. I'm sure Apple has done the same thing more covertly for years, but seeing everything I say, type, search, view, read.. not to mention every place I eat at, travel to or shop.. neatly organized into a little packaged profile makes me feel like a product more than ever. Eliminating Google's permissions to track this info also eliminates much of the Pixel's functionality as a smart phone with fluid communication between apps. I should have probably mentioned this first because I absolutely hate that aspect of it. Renee Looker I don't know about anyone else's opinion on the Pixel phone but I have the Pixel XL Blue and have had it since release. I've not had any issues with my phone, absolutely love it. Really quite eager to see what Google will be releasing next, the rumors are on the rise on what's up next. Nicholas Conrad Great article! techieland You and we are the customers when it come to the Pixel and Pixel Xl. And even the late and great Nexus products to some extent. Personally I think the Pixel phones were a fail, Google should have stuck to making reference level phones to ensure the manufacturers understand what the minimum an Android phone is supposed to be like. Samsung and OnePlus obviously gets it but it seems LG, HTC, & Motorola, are struggling despite all 3 being manufacturers of Nexus/AOSP devices. sgtguthrie *couldn't care less Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 142k 105k Latest Deals 2 [Deal Alert] Order an Amazon gift card valued at $25 or more through Alexa and get a $5 promo credit 2017/04/11 3:50pm PDTApr 11, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Verizon BlackBerry Priv for $259.99 on eBay 2017/04/11 12:35pm PDTApr 11, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Amazon's Gold Box deal has a SanDisk MicroSD 256GB for $120 and a 128GB dual USB-C/A drive for $39 2017/04/11 4:46am PDTApr 11, 2017 35 [Update: Added some more] Deal Alert: Here are some more temporarily free apps and games for your Sunday 2017/04/09 3:05pm PDTApr 9, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Gen LTE for $179.99 ($220 off) on eBay 2017/04/08 7:15pm PDTApr 8, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Ron Amadeo - Apr 11, 2017 4:58 pm UTC reader comments 122 Share this story The Google Express shopping list (left) is full of links to Google Express. The Google Keep shopping list (right) is full of features and buttons. It's the same story on the mobile app. Google Express (the blue app) has nothing to offer. Google Keep (everything else) has so many controls they're spread across three screenshots. Here are Google Keep's keyboard shortcuts on a desktop. Say goodbye to all this. The Google Assistant, Google's voice assistant that powers the Google app on Android phones, tablets, and Google Home, has just gotten a major downgrade. In a move reminiscent of all the forced and user-hostile Google+ integrations, Google has gutted the Google Assistant's shopping list functionality in order to turn it into a big advertisement for Google's shopping site, Google Express. The shopping list has been a major feature of the Google Assistant. You can say "Add milk to my shopping list," and the Google Assistant would dutifully store this information somewhere. The shopping list used to live in Google Keep. Keep is Google's primary note-taking app, making it a natural home for the shopping list with lots of useful tools and management options. Now the shopping list lives in Google Express. Express is an online shopping site, and it has no business becoming a dedicated place to store a shopping list that probably has nothing to do with Google's online marketplace. Since Google Express is an online shopping site (and, again, has no business having a note-taking app grafted onto it), the move from Keep to Google Express means the Assistant's shopping list functionality loses the following features: Being able to reorder items with drag and drop. Reminders. Google Keep could attach a time or location-based reminder to the shopping list. Walk into the store, and your shopping list pops up! Adding images to the shopping list. Adding voice recordings to the shopping list Real time collaboration with other users. (Express has sharing, but you can't see other people as they type—you have to refresh.) Android Wear integration. Desktop keyboard shortcuts. Checkbox management: deleting all checked items, unchecking all items, hiding checkboxes. Alternatively, the move from Keep to Google Express means the Assistant shopping list gains the following features: Google Express advertising next to every list item. Google Express advertising at the bottom of the page. The only things users seemed to have "gained" in this transition are a Google Express search button next to every single list item and a big "search for everything on Google Express" link at the bottom of the page. Sometimes there is also a Google Express ad in the middle of the page, slotting in nicely between the list item ads and the ad at the bottom. This move frankly benefits no one but Google. The Assistant now only puts voice-added items in Google Express. There's no way to change it back to Google Keep. There's no way to restore the myriad features Google users have lost. The Assistant was pitched as a hardware feature on the Google Pixel, and it's the only feature on Google Home. Unlike most of Google's freebie, ad-supported apps, these are both devices that people paid cold, hard cash for, and to gut one of their best features in order to push a tier-three Google service feels like a bait-and-switch. Stop trying to make Google Express happen Enlarge / Google's incredibly unpopular Google+ integration strategy seems to be back for Google Express. Owl Turd Comix You'd be forgiven for having never heard of Google Express. Google Express is Google's Amazon Prime clone, but it comes without any of Amazon's sheer size, selection, direct sales, shipping prowess, free returns, video service, music service, or book service. Google Express' main hook—same-day delivery—only works in a tiny selection of major US cities, leaving the vast, vast amount of Google Assistant users with little reason to care about the service. Users outside the US can't even download the Google Express app, so they can no longer access their shopping list through an app. They're stuck with a mobile website. Google itself didn't seem like it cared much about Google Express until now, either. The company treated this app more like an obligatory "Amazon competes with us in some areas so we have to build this Amazon Prime competitor" project rather than something that was organically good and useful. Google is great at advertising, search, and building software, all of which has little to do with shipping products out to users quickly at a low price. Without any synergy with the rest of the company, Express seemed like one of those Google services that would be quietly shuttered after a few years. Google doesn't even seem that involved with Google Express. Google acts purely as a middleman—its own support page says it is only "an online marketplace that connects shoppers with popular stores." Google builds the online storefront that lists products from brick-and-mortar stores like Kohl's, Walgreens, and Guitar Center. Google doesn't fulfill the orders and doesn't ship the orders. Google does charge $95 a year for membership, but unlike Amazon it only offers fast shipping. Prime also throws in a premium video and music service, while Google's closest competitor, YouTube Red (which comes with a Google Music subscription), costs another $119.88 per year. This is to say nothing of the fact that Prime Video is a top-tier video service that offers TV shows, movies, and great original content, while YouTube Red only has video content from amateur YouTube "stars." Grafting the shopping list onto Google Express seems wildly out of touch. Google Express has such a limited selection that many items just can't be found on the site. And maybe all the rich Silicon Valley Google employees shop differently than I do, but no amount of advertising is going to make me order toilet paper over the Internet at a hefty markup. Shopping lists are very often for groceries and other essentials that usually aren't bought online or can't be bought online. For the vast majority of users, the Google Express integration makes no sense. A non-existent transition plan Making a shopping list with voice commands is a thing normal people do. So if a company is ripping the Assistant/Keep integration out from under them, it should explain to users what's going on. But Google doesn't really do this. I still have the special "Google Assistant shopping list" in Google Keep, but the Assistant has quietly stopped sending new items to it. When you verbally add a new item, the Assistant opens a webpage for the Google Express shopping list. There's nothing in Google Keep that explains the Assistant shopping list won't work anymore. The most communication Google has delivered is to release a support page detailing the change. No normal person has a way of finding out about the support page. If Google wanted to be really slick, the Google Assistant could just verbally explain the change to the user next time they invoke the shopping list feature. "Hey, just so you know, I moved your shopping list to Google Express against your will." (The Assistant could be programmed to answer user questions like "Why have you betrayed me, Google Assistant?" and "Where did all the list controls go?") Google Keep is a default app on some devices, and it sits in the "100,000,000 - 500,000,000" install bucket on the Play Store. Google Express has only "500,000 - 1,000,000" installs—that's 200 to 500 times smaller of a user base. When the Assistant switches from Keep to Express, it displays the shopping list in a mobile webpage. Nothing in the Assistant tells the user that they could at least have the shopping list appear in a minimal app if they downloaded Google Express. This was something I only discovered after reading a comment thread. I can't imagine how most people are going to deal with this. In a few days, I'll probably get a bunch of messages from friends and family, asking what happened to the Assistant shopping list. They'll want to know why it looks different and why the Google Keep list and the Assistant don't link up anymore. They'll also probably ask me why Google did this, and I won't have an answer for them. The move from Keep to Express removes a lot of important shopping list features in exchange for zero user benefits. It's a move that appears to only benefit Google, but even then I can't imagine that the many people building a shopping list for a brick-and-mortar store will convert to Google's expensive and limited online market place. This move seems like something straight out of the Google+ era. It's a move designed solely to benefit Google by forcefully integrating two unrelated products. At least Google+ had the vague benefits of a universal Google profile and shared contacts list, but here there are no user enhancements at all in the move to Express. Google seems to just be hoping for a few extra conversions to its online shopping store. If Google wants to retain users' trust, it should revert this change. Forget about pushing Google Express on users who are just trying to make a shopping list and focus only on providing a useful tool. Maybe Google will eventually fix Google Express and port over all of Google Keep's features. That still doesn't make it ok on "day one" to take away something that works and replace it with something that sucks.

Many iPhone and Android smartphones offer fingerprint technology to allow easy unlocking.  (Manu Fernandez / The Associated Press)   By Vindu GoelThe New York Times Tues., April 11, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO—Fingerprint sensors have turned modern smartphones into miracles of convenience. A touch of a finger unlocks the phone — no password required. With services like Apple Pay or Android Pay, a fingerprint can buy a bag of groceries, a new laptop or even a $1 million vintage Aston Martin. And pressing a finger inside a banking app allows the user to pay bills or transfer thousands of dollars. While such wizardry is convenient, it has also left a gaping security hole. New findings published Monday by researchers at New York University and Michigan State University suggest that smartphones can easily be fooled by fake fingerprints digitally composed of many common features found in human prints. In computer simulations, the researchers from the universities were able to develop a set of artificial “MasterPrints” that could match real prints similar to those used by phones as much as 65 per cent of the time. The researchers did not test their approach with real phones, and other security experts said the match rate would be significantly lower in real-life conditions. Still, the findings raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of fingerprint security on smartphones. “It’s almost certainly not as worrisome as presented, but it’s almost certainly pretty darn bad,” said Andy Adler, a professor of systems and computer engineering at Carleton University in Ottawa, who studies biometric security systems. “If all I want to do is take your phone and use your Apple Pay to buy stuff, if I can get into one in 10 phones, that’s not bad odds.” Article Continued Below Full human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but the finger scanners on phones are so small that they read only partial fingerprints. When a user sets up fingerprint security on an Apple iPhone or a phone that runs Google’s Android software, the phone typically takes eight to 10 images of a finger to make it easier to make a match. And many users record more than one finger — say, the thumb and forefinger of each hand. Since a finger swipe has to match only one stored image to unlock the phone, the system is vulnerable to false matches. “It’s as if you have 30 passwords and the attacker only has to match one,” said Nasir Memon, a professor of computer science and engineering at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering, who is one of three authors of the study, which was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security. The other authors are Aditi Roy, a post-doctoral fellow at NYU’s Tandon School, and Arun Ross, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State. Memon said their findings indicated that if you could somehow create a magic glove with a MasterPrint on each finger, you could get into 40 to 50 per cent of iPhones within the five tries allowed before the phone demands the numeric password, known as a personal identification number. Apple said the chance of a false match in the iPhone’s fingerprint system was 1 in 50,000 with one fingerprint enrolled. Ryan James, a company spokesperson, said Apple had tested various attacks when developing its Touch ID system, and also incorporated other security features to prevent false matches. Google declined to comment. The actual risk is difficult to quantify. Apple and Google keep many details of their fingerprint technology secret, and the dozens of companies that make Android phones can adapt Google’s standard design in ways that reduce the level of security. Stephanie Schuckers, a professor at Clarkson University and director of the Center for Identification Technology Research, was cautious about the implications of the MasterPrint findings. She said the researchers used a mid-range, commercially available software program that was designed to match full fingerprints, limiting the broader applicability of their findings. “To really know what the impact would be on a cellphone, you’d have to try it on the cellphone,” she said. She noted that cellphone-makers and others who use fingerprint security systems are studying anti-spoofing techniques to detect the presence of a real finger, such as looking for perspiration or examining patterns in deeper layers of skin. A new fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm, for example, uses ultrasound. Phone-makers also said that the ease of touching a finger to unlock a phone meant more users actually turned on security features instead of leaving their phones unlocked — a common habit in the early days of smartphones. Ross acknowledged the limitations of the work. “Most of the current smartphone vendors do not give us access to the fingerprint image,” he said. Still, the team’s fundamental finding that partial fingerprints are vulnerable to spoofing is significant, said Chris Boehnen, the manager of the federal government’s Odin program, which studies how to defeat biometric security attacks as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. “What’s concerning here is that you could find a random phone, and your barrier to attack is pretty low,” Boehnen said. Phone-makers could easily increase security by making it harder to match the partial fingerprint, he said, “but the average phone company is more worried about you being annoyed that you have to put your finger against the phone two or three times than they are with someone breaking into it.” Adding a larger fingerprint sensor would also decrease the risk, Boehnen said. And some newer biometric security options, such as the iris scanner in ’s new Galaxy S8, are harder to fool. Memon said that despite his research he was still using fingerprint security on his iPhone. “I’m not worried,” he said. “I think it’s still a very convenient way of unlocking a phone. But I’d rather see Apple make me enter the PIN if it’s idle for one hour.” Read more about: Google, Apple Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

The Labor Department on April 7 claimed in a court hearing it had “found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce” at Google. The Mountain View tech titan has voluntarily admitted through its diversity reports that its workforce is overwhelmingly male, particularly in technical jobs. But the allegations of discrimination against women in pay were, reportedly, met with surprise at the Mountain View tech giant. “We were taken aback by this assertion, which came without any supporting data or methodology,” Google HR vice-president Eileen Naughton said in a blog post April 10. “Google conducts rigorous, annual analyses so that our pay practices remain aligned with our commitment to equal pay practices. “It’s very important to us that men and women who join Google in the same role are compensated on a level playing field, when they start and throughout their careers here.” Companies such as Google that accept federal contracts fall under the scrutiny of the Labor Department, which in January went after Oracle, alleging it paid white men more than women, blacks and Asians. Oracle has denied the claims. Naughton said Google had handed over to the feds hundreds of thousands of documents, and that the Labor Department was still seeking thousands of employee records, including contact information. Google, according to the department, has been battling to prevent access to its salary data. Naughton described the firm’s process for ensuring gender equity in pay. “Each year, we suggest an amount for every employee’s new compensation … based on role, job level, job location as well as current and recent performance ratings.  This suggested amount is ‘blind’ to gender; the analysts who calculate the suggested amounts do not have access to employees’ gender data. “Our pay equity model then looks at employees in the same job categories, and analyzes their compensation to confirm that the adjusted amount shows no statistically significant differences between men’s and women’s compensation.” Late last year the company conducted its most recent pay-equity analysis, across 52 “major” job categories, Naughton said. “Our analysis gives us confidence that there is no gender pay gap at Google.” It’s not clear what, if any, evidence federal authorities have that supports the claim that Google engaged in what it called “extreme” discrimination against women. Meanwhile, employment website Glassdoor on April 10 put out a report on its analysis of salary data contributed to the site by current and former Google workers. “Men on average do earn about 16.3 percent more than women at Google,” Glassdoor chief economist Andrew Chamberlain wrote. “But that’s not a complete or fair comparison, as it compares software engineers and marketing associates as if they’re in the same pay bracket.” Making an “apples-to-apples comparison of workers with similar jobs and backgrounds,” the 16.3 percent gap shrank to 1.6 percecnt, “which is not statistically significantly different from zero,” Chamberlain said. “There’s no evidence in salaries on Glassdoor of a systematic gender pay gap at Google.” Photo: A Google data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

YouTube TV hands-on: Google's off to a good start Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/06 3:13pm PDTApr 6, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 63 Share on Twitter Total Shares177 Applications Google News Reviews Videos The expansion of services like Netflix and Hulu has led to fewer people subscribing to traditional cable. Still, there are some things you can't get with those streaming services, most notably live TV feeds. That's what Google aims to offer with YouTube TV. Google announced the service a few months ago, and it went live in a handful of cities yesterday. I haven't had a cable subscription in years, so I was anxious to try it out. YouTube TV seems like an excellent start, but there are definitely some pain points. The Basics YouTube TV is currently only available in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It will run you $35 per month and includes access to about 40 channels of live streaming TV. That includes local channels like Fox, CBS, and so on. The focus on live local channels is why the rollout is regional—Google has to get the broadcasters on board with YouTube TV in each market. There's a reasonably good selection of channels including all the locals, NatGeo, ESPN, Disney, FX, USA, SyFy, and more. There are no Viacom channels like Comedy Central or MTV, which is not unexpected. Viacom is notoriously protective of its content. There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo. YouTube TV is available via the Android (or iOS) app, as well in your desktop web browser. There is not currently a client for Android TV, which strikes me as profoundly odd. There is, however, Chromecast support for getting the stream onto a bigger screen. Although, not everyone is cool with using their phone as a remote control all the time. You can watch live streams of all the included channels, and there's some on-demand content too. If you can't catch something live, you can set up series recordings in YouTube TV. All the content you record is saved online, and you can record as much as you want. How can it be unlimited? The recordings expire after nine months. Still, PlayStation Vue removes things after 28 days, and Sling TV limits you to 50GB of space. Living with YouTube TV I've mostly been using YouTube TV on Android, and the app is nice overall. The interface is clean, with just three tabs in the main interface and heavy use of animated thumbnails. Across the top of the app are tabs for Library, Home, and Live. The Home tab is basically a list of suggestions for things you might want to watch or record—it even shows you what's most popular right now. The "popular" live carousel at the top is the first place you'll see YouTube TV's live thumbnails. The channel previews play (no sound, thankfully) as you scroll through. It's like flipping channels on your TV. Below that are several lists of suggestions, including a few that push sports. Over in the Live tab, it's again like flipping channels. You scroll vertically through the channel list, and each one has a live thumbnail when it's selected. Sound doesn't kick in until you tap on a channel to watch it. I'm impressed with how smooth this interface runs with all the live thumbnails. The streams were noticeably jerky on the LG G6, but everything runs fine on the Mate 9 and Pixel. I'm not sure what's up with the inconsistency there, but it's usually a very snappy app. The streams are 720p for most channels, so they don't look flawless when casting to a TV (some are 1080p). No one I've showed it to thought the video (720p or 1080p) looked bad, though. Video quality is great on the device and good enough when casting to a Shield TV or a second gen Chromecast. I don't have a first gen dongle around to test anymore, but apparently the app warns you of possible performance issues there. Audio playback will continue in the background while you do other things in the app, but it stops when you leave it (the regular YouTube app has background play for Red subscribers). That's probably not a huge deal for TV, but it would still be nice to have. A floating pop-out player would be better, though. Throughout the app you'll see the "plus" button to add a series or movie to your library. Doing so will record any new instances of the content whenever it airs on TV. You can simply add anything that looks interesting to your library because the storage is unlimited. Recordings can be started after a program begins, but it won't actually be available in your library until it's over. Recordings that you've scheduled ahead of time will let you scrub back to the beginning if you want to watch live, which is a great feature to have. And yes, you can skip commercials in recorded content. The Library tab is split up into shows, movies, sports, and events. There's also a section that shows all your scheduled recordings, including those that are in progress. There's some on-demand content available in YouTube TV, which is confusingly merged with your recordings. The app doesn't really differentiate between the two when you are subscribed to a show—you just have a details page with a list of all available episodes. In addition, there are still restrictions on how many on-demand episodes are available from one rights holder to the next. You can end up with a patchwork of available streams. I should also note that some of the on-demand content has ads; mostly movies with pre-roll ads. The desktop interface is slick too.  Account management and value YouTube TV is only in a few markets right now, and that limits what you can do even if you live in one of those places. Let's say you live in Chicago. YouTube TV streams you all your local channels, lets you set recordings, and watch them at any time. If you go on a trip to Orlando where there's no YouTube TV, you can no longer access those local channels live or create new recordings. Content you've recorded is still accessible in the Library tab, and the cable channels are live. Weirder still, there are completely different restrictions if you travel to New York where there is YouTube TV. You can't see your Chicago stations live, but you can see the New York ones. However, you can't create new recordings on the local channels while in New York. The cable channel recordings work normally in this situation. There will be some other bizarre restrictions too; like no football games streamed on the phone. You have to cast them to a TV because Verizon has an exclusive with the NFL on mobile streaming. This whole situation only serves to remind us what a mess TV streaming rights have become. YouTube TV supports up to 6 accounts per subscription. They're tied to Google's family group system. You cannot set these up from the Android app, which is strange. YouTube TV invitations can only be sent from the web. That said, it works just fine once you get people added. Each user has their own settings and library of recordings. However, there's a maximum limit of three active streams per account. The value proposition here will depend on what you want out of TV. If you won't put up with missing a show here and there, YouTube TV probably won't work. The selection is better than other streaming-only services thanks to all the local channels, but you're still missing big ones like Comedy Central, MTV, HGTV, and TNT. For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord. You ought to be able to see most everything with local channels, a few ESPNs, and other sports channels. If you haven't had cable for a while and Netflix is starting to get stale, YouTube TV could be just what you need. It gives you something to stream live, along with faster access to new episodes of your favorite shows. The $35 monthly cost is a bit steep for a single person, but if you've got a few family members who would use it, YouTube TV can be a very good value. I'm undecided if I'll keep YouTube TV past the one-month free trial. I already have Netflix and Hulu, and I don't watch sports. So, the added expense feels a little high. I expect Google will work to expand the channel list quickly, and YouTube TV might be an easy sell after a few additions. Tags Google hands-on Reviews streaming tv video youtube tv subscribe ...

Without any regional sports networks there will be a huge gap between cable and this service. Almost all major sports besides the NFL show local teams on regional sports networks. OligarchyAmbulance What networks are those? I don't really watch sports, but I know a lot of stuff around here is on Comcast Sports Net which are supported. Carson Saldanha NBA uses local networks for most regular season games with a few national broadcasts here and there. Taco Monster At least in Chicago, Bulls games are on CSN. Carson Saldanha Where I live, they use Root Sports. Raymie Humbert That's great in the markets except New York where SNY (majority owned by the Mets), YES (Fox Sports-owned) and MSG would all be necessary. Fox Sports would also be a must for expansion into quite a few additional major markets. 4Ui812 Google needs to allow us to choose our own channels. Don't need the sports and we shouldn't have to pay for over the air channels. I know it's still new and maybe somewhere down the line they'll do it but they could atleast have a option for not taking half of these shit channels so they can bring the price down. Jacob Fulbright So if you are one of the people who spoofed your GPS location to check this out, does it stop working once you turn the GPS spoof off and it realizes you're outside one of the regions in which the service is available? RyanWhitwam It only turns off local channel live streams. Jacob Fulbright That's what I'm mostly interested in as I don't get very good reception where I live. Strange that it wouldn't give you a choice of watching what's local to your current location or based on your "home" location. Darrin Lim I'm interested in Google's revenue model for this. Does it look like they are relying on subscriptions only, or are they also placing ads (either pre-roll or replacing network commercials) into the service as well? Or perhaps trying to drive users to standard YouTube vids (where they can do their normal ad placements) in the interface? Jacob Fulbright I was hoping this would have a tie in with major YouTube creators in some way. Good Mythical Morning, etc. Willie Chalmers III I'm sure this will be big media-oriented. YouTube is already for the PewDiePies, Good Mythical Mornings and the rest. cheeto0 The only place I see ads are in on demand. Darrin Lim Thanks @cheeto0:disqus This makes sense - with Live there's limited opportunity for pre-rolls as the user wants into the content as soon as possible so they don't miss anything. But with on-demand there's less time pressure, so they can put a pre-roll or two in. It does answer the question - both subscription and ad rev streams - I'm guessing YouTube could generate quite a lot from pre (and post?)-rolls against on-demand content. Do network ads remain in on-demand? Or are they replaced by YT ads or stripped completely? thespacecowboy Network ads are only on shows you've recorded yourself. Google ads are on the on-demand stuff, Shawn Spring I was hoping for a tie in with YouTube Red users, for maybe a modest monthly discount. No such luck.

Lateef Alabi-Oki Cable gives you unlimited DVR? psychoace Also you can't share cable with other people either Naxx ENVY 1) some services don't allow you to share with other people and is considered a breach of contract 2) i get what he's saying, we have to have 5-6 differernt contracts to watch shows when cable covers it all not sure i like how its all going tbh, its going to end up being more expensive to have the same channels. .. just the illusion of choice BhupSinghBhadu Baf Good settings abc Cable eats up your data cap? Lateef Alabi-Oki I don't have a data cap. UberCrew No but we have two TIVOs with 4GB of drive space and we never have had issues with needing to delete anything before we wanted to. Our TIVOs allow us to skip over commercials unlike Youtube TV which forces you to watch the On-demand version of a show if one is available even if you DVR'd that show. With Youtube's On-demand you are unable to skip over commercials. Shawn Spring Have you had a cable sub lately? I pay for a phone, small TV bundle w/DVR, and 100Mbps internet and its over $175/monthly. Even if I just had the internet alone (about $99/month) that and YouTube TV would save me quite a bit of money per year. C64 I thought 45 euro's for cable / internet / house phine was a lot over here 😮 suavemezie With YouTube TV, you will be doubling your data at least. Calculate Shawn Spring Hardwired broadband has no data cap so the amount of data I use is irrelevant - as I would likely be on WiFi when using YouTube TV at home. thespacecowboy Some people have data caps on wired internet. Shawn Spring Is that a real thing? Because I'd burn Spectrum to the ground if they tried to charge me a data cap like a Verizon style wireless plan. Chris Yeah, I want to say Cox had me capped at 100GB for the past 2-3 years. My parents had a similar cap but I just recently switched them to AT&T/DirecTV with unlimited data thespacecowboy oh yes. https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/12/netflix-calls-on-the-fcc-to-fix-unreasonable-data-caps/ Shawn Spring That's janky af Brandon Giesing My family switched from AT&T to Charter Spectrum (before the whole Spectrum branding became a thing) because AT&T had around a 150 GB per month cap and once you hit that you had to pay like $20 extra to add 40 more GB. With 4 people constantly streaming music and video, downloading apps and Linux distros, and much more; we not only hit that every month but had to pay the extra $20 3-5 times every month. Our bills was like $300+ a month (Internet and Phone, not counting the separate expensive TV bill which was either DirecTV or DISH) Geoff Johnson Be glad you don't have Comcast, they have a 1TB cap. Malachi Jones Damn, here in the UK we have some providers offering £14.99/month internet only deals, super cheap in comparison to $99/month! Geoff Johnson What's the speed at 14.99/mo? thespacecowboy So Cox for basic channels is $80/month. HD receiver is $8.50/month. DVDR is additional $10 a month. So $35 a month? Doesn't seem to bad, but YMMV depending on what channels you really want/need. cheeto0 Plus it's like having 3 DVRs cable boxes.(6 sorta) and mobile access to it. thespacecowboy The mobile access is huge. I think the other suppliers limit what you can watch on mobile, whereas with YouTube it's baked right in to the product offering. cheeto0 I watch on 3 TV's and any mobile device, with unlimited DVR. I don't see that costing the same on cable. UberCrew It's not a real DVR if you can't skip over advertisements on all shows. So Youtube's "unlimited DVR" features is overrated. JDC Yeah, no. I was paying $140/month for TV (No DVR) and 25/25 internet (after 1 year at $80/month). I cut the cord and now I'm down to $50/month for just internet (100/100). YouTube TV brings me up to $85/month with "DVR" functionality, and that $35 isn't just some "introductory offer." I'm much better off than I was. wickets I'm paying 25$ just for local basic so youtube is a huge upgrade Shawn Medeiros Get a HDTV antenna. You can get those right over the air free in much of the us. thespacecowboy Yeah. We did this about 18 months ago and use a Tivo OTA with lifetime service. Shame there are not more OTA channels. I'm going to attempt cable card but its not easy (the bracket is there but not the full thing which has to be bought separately). Geoff Johnson Do you have any idea how much cable TV actually costs? Tucker Sferro yes - after cutting the cord I receive about 1 letter per week from Fios begging me to come back, with basic packages starting around $29/mo. Brock Dawkins I had sling TV when it was first released and my God it was a nightmare. Only 1 stream per account, terrible app and no dvr. I tried the month free trial of YouTube TV and I love it. The interface is awesome. The DVR works great, and the storage is awesome. Can access dvr from anywhere too. I wish I wasn't locked into a DirecTV contract for two years. Only thing it needs is a few more channels and an Android TV app. Gfame103 No Android TV app at launch was hurtful. I'm really beginning to lose faith in Google. Everything that come out of Google is half baked and then support slowly begins to die. After the fall of Google Wallet card support, the dismantling of Google+, the slow death Hangouts, and lack of Android TV/Live Channels support I can not get to vested with their products. Maybe I will try YouTube TV in a few years.... If it's​ around. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Rip reader Bruce Wayne Calm down. Android TV will come in due time. It's a new service. It's not even available nationwide yet. Midnitte Hopefully it exists once it launches nationally, but it's really silly they dont yet have an Android *TV* app for their *TV* service. Zachary Dunn Android TV should be a key feature of their TV offering. Not having it at launch is ridiculous. Not to mention, Youtube Gaming has been out for over a year and still doesn't have Android TV support, which is odd since Android TV is a platform built for streaming and gaming. Play Music on Android TV hasn't received any features released in the last year. Everytime Google releases a tv app without Android TV support, ppl say just wait for it, but it never happens or is half assed. KChristainsen you would think this is a no brainier to have an app for ATV. Just ridiculous. YaKillaCJ YouTube Red, Netflix and PSVue is currently the way to go as it covers everything except Viacom. Seems like YouTubeTV can be a replacement wants it mature. I'm dropping Hulu because that's covered by PSVue and HBO because honestly Game Of Thrones the only thing worth it in there Besides Sesame Street for the kids. thespacecowboy "For the kids". I love that show. Now, as for Daniel Tiger on PBS. That kid speaks the truth. Scott Kart Until Comedy Central, TBS, TNT, and SNY/MSG are on here...I'm out. thespacecowboy Don't lie. You're holding out for HGTV :) psychoace At least he has e! Corbin Davenport Tiny House Hunters deserves an Emmy. Taco Monster Sheer genius. thespacecowboy If you like that, check out George Clark's Amazing Spaces. It's on UK Channel 4 but likely available elsewhere. http://www.channel4.com/programmes/george-clarkes-amazing-spaces cheeto0 The interface is great and the discovery is great. But it still feels a little beta in some areas. I can cast to Chromecast and the Nvidia shield but not to my Vizio TV with "chromecast built-in​ '. Also it doesn't like multiwindow in nougat...Plus no android tv app. But most google 1.0 products feel a little beta and then get reiterated upon. Overall I like it alot so far. King_Android I've been able to stream in 1080p. The interface also needs to show what's playing next. Not having the ability to quickly view what's next on a different channel is cumbersome. psychoace Not all channels or content is 1080p which is why the author thinks that Artem Russakovskii You're right, some channels do support 1080p. We'll update the post. John Doe True but not all channels and when comparing it to my TV service the quality is not the same on my 2nd generation chromecast compared to my Dish Network service. Youtube is probably using some lame video compression or the networks are whoever it is it sucks. newtonfb For people bitching about $35....split it with 3 friends and it comes out to $12 a month. Also you can get rid of Hulu because you have unlimited DVR so it acts like Hulu does and records the show you want. tim242 But...ads. Hulu with no ads = $12/mo. newtonfb Ya but you can fast forward past the ads with the DVR feature thespacecowboy Only on things you recorded yourself, not on demand. UberCrew Not if there is also an On-Demand version available for the show that your DVRd. If the show that you DVRd is available On-Demand you are forced to watch the On-Demand version with the inability to skip over advertisements. Geoff Johnson Hulu doesn't have live TV. tim242 We were not talking about live TV. UberCrew Not yet they don't but they will have it soon. Hopefully they offer a real DVR unlike Youtube TV. AlRegals The price tag is a little high for a single user, but the experience really does make me want to cancel Hulu. My biggest gripe with Hulu is the unreliability with cable tv shows. But if I can have easy access to my Syfy, USA, CW, Freeform, and Bravo along with not having to sign up for CBS Access to watch Big Bang then I'M IN. Plus Live TV?! I just need Android TV and Google Home support and this will be the perfect set up. Ramon Also note, there is NO 5.1 surround support on YouTube TV. DirkBelig Well that blows. Ramon Very. The only one that came close to this support is DirectTV Now. John Doe Everything is great except the Youtube ads on-demand content and the resolution on most channels (watching on the web is worse than mobile and on tv). If Google can get Viacom and Turner Broadcasting channels, keep the price the same and "encourage" networks to upgrade to 1080P and 4K streams (at least have the on-demand in full HD), support HDR as well. Then the service will be perfect. Also, Where is the gaming console apps and other home entertainment devices? I wish they would have just updated the regular Youtube app. Now I have 4 youtube apps: Youtube Youtube TV Youtube Music Youtube Gaming Youtube kids They can easily tie all of that with the account instead of having 5 different apps Just have a section popup if a user is subscribed to a service. Bruce Wayne 4k and HDR?? Stop. 4k content isn't even produced on most TV channels and you're jumping to HDR. ISPs are already putting caps, charging for overages and charging extra for non bundled internet service. The bandwidth needed for 4k on one stream alone would strain most people's connections. Geoff Johnson Then stream the 1080p version John Doe Hi, have you meet Netflix? Also, there is the choice I am not saying Google should force everyone's stream to the highest resolution (They don't even do that now, there is auto select). FYI, HDR has nothing to do with 4K and it actually does not add much to a the bandwidth requirement (Netflix said it adds 2.5MB/s compared to 12MB/s for 4K) Lars Jeppesen Do the channels even broadcast in 1080p or 4K? Box Most slim bundles and IPTV setups are only available in 720p at this time. YouTube TV is not alone in this. John Doe Most do in 1080i and I only have one 4K channel through Dish Network. TechGuy22 Mediocre start AlRegals Not sure how consist this is, but while watching Big Bang Theory on the desktop there I only got 3 15sec ads between segments. Switched over to my TV via Chromecast and the TV ads increased to 7 15sec ads. Just an observation bobinchicago Are "all local channels" just the 5 commercial networks, or do you also get independent channels, PBS, and subchannels? I've got 30 channels on my OTA Tivo and I've filtered a bunch out. There's 7 PBS channels alone. Also, you mention there's no Android TV app yet which sucks, but since the Nexus Player can act as a Chromecast, can you cast YouTube TV to that in particular? Thanks! PhantomGamers For sure you'll only get the channels that Google has agreements with, I doubt they're just grabbing up every OTA signal and streaming that. thespacecowboy It's going to depend on market. But I have many PBS on my Tivo, but none on my Youtube TV. Any device that has Chromecast should work. Some at the moment don't seem to work though (such as some Vizio TVs). After you pay for your 2nd month (after trial) they will send you a free Chromecast anyway. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I need AMC before I jump ship from PSV ...and it to be in my market NoNotTellingYou AMC is on the way according to Google. Mike Arnett If it recommends channels, will it recommend sports events based on teams you track on Google Assistant? Bruce Wayne That's a very good question. I'm sure Google will eventually learn how to tie in the service based on your search history and all that. hp-fourtwenty no, you have the option to record all games of any team you select, which also adds it as a recommendation when you log in. SpiderDice No YouTube TV for Android TV? Totally makes sense.. ast00 Costs about 5 times as much as it should. Lars Jeppesen No hp-fourtwenty 50 live channels, and this is the first time I've been able to watch a New York Rangers game online without needing a traditional cable package or watching a pirated stream. I'm happy to pay only $35...especially since I already pay $10 for GPMAA/red thespacecowboy Isn't GPMAA on top of the $35? hp-fourtwenty yup, plus yt red exclusive programming...just no ad free yt red....and strangely no yttv background playback DragoCubed I really like the design of this app. I won't say anything else because I'm not in the US. Bruce Wayne Device support is very key. It needs to support all the major devices and consoles (Xbox One, PS4, Roku, Fire devices, Android TV etc) Expand to five simultaneous streams. Acquire more channels. Lars Jeppesen People still watch MTV? Geoff Johnson Of course... Dirty Dave http://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_youtube-tv2-768x432.jpg Im in the UK so this article is pointless for me, but what keyboard is this though Ryan? Ryan Definitely interesting. Ill hold off until college ball is back on, I only really care about OTA and ESPNs, so they have that advantage. sloheim "For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord" Wrong, wrong, for the love of god, WRONG. No NHL Network, NFL Network, or MLB Network or NBA TV. Anti-sports. Box Does the "three active streams" restriction include on-demand and recordings? Ben Nicholls Not too interested unless the provide more package options, or a la carte packages. Part of the reason I cut the cord was to stop paying for channels I don't watch. I would like to see at minimum a "no sports" package. ESPN is one of the most expensive channels and I don't like paying for it in a package when I don't watch it. An AndroidTV app is also a must. BinaryTB Google's Family Group system? Sounds like it won't support Google Apps for Work for people that actually pay Google already for their own domain. Add it to the list: Google Fi Google Play Music Family Plan Google Play Apps Family Sharing DirkBelig >"There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo." And what's preventing anyone from simply subscribing to HBO NOW or bundling Showtime or Starz for $9 with their Amazon Prime package? Anyone who would get this probably has a Netflix account and app, so I don't understand what the beef is here having to a la carte HBO other than it breaks the cable channel grid paradigm. #FirstWorldProblems thespacecowboy +ing a show also adds any on-demand shows to your library. Downside is those ones have ads, like Hulu. TV guide is frustrating. You can't easily see past the current show and the next one. EPG is weird. You can click on the channel name and then browse that actual channel, but not in a grid style. hp-fourtwenty Yes, we need a good epg severely!! Lex Lybrand It's not available on Android TV. That's a day-1 must-have. Sean McGeezer I'll wait for Cartoon Network at the very least, though it may not happen Terry Sanchez It does not have the Cooking channel and is lacking many channels. I hope this improves over time. SlingTV is still better right now. JG Is it steam only? Or can one pin content to their devices for local/offline play? Then I could​ save a recording or two to watch on my (non-driving) commute without having to worry about adding to much to my monthly bill at $10/gig. Or maybe save something for longer than the 9 month period. Google's Play Movie/TV app allows it, as does the new light weight version of YouTube being beta'd in India now. Netflix and Showtime do to... I would assume if they can do it, why not also YouTube TV? thespacecowboy No download option at the moment. Iamsecond Blah blah blah, thanks for more US-only features YouTube, glad to see you're working hard on this when you haven't even launched YouTube Red in the UK yet. Yep, thanks.

Google is testing screenshot cropping and drawing tools in its search app Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 4:01am PDTApr 11, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 55 Share on Facebook 61 Share on Twitter Total Shares146 Applications Google News Google has been tinkering with screenshots for a few months. First, some hidden code was found in Nougat that would trigger partial screenshot functionality, then we started hearing of a screenshot cropping and drawing option showing up inside the Google app. That last bit is starting to show for some users including our reader Nicholas who shared the news on Reddit and further explained how it works. If you're on the lucky end of this server-side test, when you open the Google app, you'll be greeted with a new permission to access device storage. Google explains that this will be used to improve the handling of screenshots taken "in the app," so you should be ready for disappointment if you expected this to be a system-wide option. After that, when you're inside the Google app and you take a regular screenshot with your device (power + volume down on most phones), a sharing menu will slide from the bottom of the screen with two new options: Crop and Draw. The first lets you crop a specific part of the screen, the second lets you draw on top of the screenshot with 6 different colors (plus an Undo option). When you're done, you can share the result to any other application. Here's a video of it in action: This looks handy, even if it's limited to only the Google app for now and would be more beneficial as a system-wide option. Those of us with Samsung phones have been able to crop and edit screenshots for years now and even take scrolling screenshots on Nougat, and those with LG phones have had QuickCapture for years as well with the option to draw and crop any screen before even screenshot-ing it first. But it's still a limited test. None of us here at Android Police have the feature yet, despite being on the same 6.16.31 beta release as Nicholas. It looks like the feature is still not ready for the public yet. By the time it is, I hope Google decides on a unified way of exiting the cropping and drawing modes. Having the "X Done" toast-like button at the bottom for the former and the X and checkmark bar at the top for the latter is weird.

Fajrul Emirullah in mine is nope being like that, maybe you must reinstall again or clear data Dan I have it happen from time to time. tap in the search bar and then tap back, the feed should refresh with cards in it again. A normal pull to refresh won't cut it. Phoenix I tried that, and clearing cash and data several times but it goes blank after showing me cards for a minute or two. thanks anyway . Carpentractor Try touching the search input box and your feed should appear. I guess it's some weird feature that has made it from the Beta into the stable, they should really try to fix this buggy crap. Pete I'm still waiting for the tabs at the bottom of the feed, plus the horizontally scrollable list of content at the top, as well as Assistant. Think Nexus owners have been forgotten in the UK. Sick of these farcical staged rollouts of software and server-side switches. Tom Erlandsen Hah, snap (I just posted the same complaint above). Incidentally I'm also UK and haven't received any of that stuff Tom Erlandsen I really hate these server-side changes. I still haven't gotten the tabs at the bottom of Google Now, or the suggestions bar along the top. Those must have been announced at LEAST 6 months ago, but still no sign on my device. I also never got the shortcuts in Now on Tap (for calendar events, navigating home, etc) before it got replaced by Assistant. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4485081f9593936ffbf0789a560eaf3f2d19ca8f91c81a9ea6d475f2634f9584.png Pete Exactly the same for me, but I still haven't got Assistant either. Sashank Narayan Set your default system language to English (US) if it isn't already. That should enable Assistant right away on your device. They did say that English (UK) and English (Australia) will follow soon. Pete Yes but there's "soon", and there's "taking the p***"! And how is it that Android devices from other manufacturers have it in the UK, with their languages set as English (UK), but Google haven't enabled it for their own devices? It makes no sense. Love Google, but sick of these staged rollouts and server-side switches. Sashank Narayan ¯_(ಠ_ಠ) _/¯ is all I can say. Completely agree with you -- staged rollouts are alright because you can still sideload the apk, but server-side switches suck. Quite a few things Google has been doing recently make no sense. :-/ kalehv Honestly, as much as I hate waiting for server side switches to show mercy on me, I really like the idea. I'm a mobile apps developer and we use these switches all the time. We call it feature flags. It makes life a lot easier to ship apps with features and then just flip the flag instead of creating a whole new release for a feature. Pete Yeah, but when a swathe of the planet gets a feature and the rest doesn't, and yet the developer keeps going on via blogs & social media about how great that feature is...

It honestly feels like a huge downgrade to me. I want to be able to do a text search from any screen, I rarely have the opportunity to use voice search. I used to select text using Now on Tap that was not selectable all the time. I've found a workaround that takes 10 taps and a ton of waiting instead of the 3 quick taps of old. And translate from any screen. I play CoC with several international players who chat in numerous Asian dialects, Now on Tap would sort this out with Screen Search in 3 taps no worries. I got sick of not having these things and changed my language from English Australian to English Virgin Islands, but now it messes up the street name pronunciation all the time. So frustrating.

(Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE New York — Google said it’s “taken aback “ by the government’s claim that it doesn’t compensate women fairly. The company said it conducts “rigorous analyses” that its pay practices are gender-blind and found “no gender pay gap” in 52 major job categories it analyzed last year. Google added that analysts who calculate suggested pay don’t have access to employees’ gender data. Google also said that beyond gender pay equity, the company recently expanded the analysis to cover race in the U.S. as well. The U.S. Department of Labor had accused Google of shortchanging women doing similar work to men, saying it found “systemic compensation disparities” across the company’s workforce. Google responded in a blog post Tuesday that the department’s assertion “came without any supporting data or methodology.” The company said it had already produced hundreds of thousands of documents in response to 18 separate requests, and the government is seeking thousands more, including contact details of employees. The department had no comment, saying the case is ongoing. The difference between Google’s and the Labor Department’s claims might come down to how each side defines pay discrimination, Tim Worstall, a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute in London, wrote in a recent post for Forbes. “Google is using a strict definition of ‘same job’ to find no gender pay gap. The Department of Labor is using a looser definition of ‘similar job’ to find that there is one,” he wrote. “Who you think is right here is entirely up to you but that’s where the disagreement is.” Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

SAN FRANCISCO – Was former President Barack Obama's birth certificate faked so he could run for office? It depends on how you ask Google.  The search engine giant last week expanded a test fact-checking program worldwide in a bid to help stop the spread of misinformation after it faced criticism for returning fake and offensive information in its popular search queries.  USA TODAY tested the feature out, asking Google a range of questions previously proven false — and some known to be true.  The result: Whether an answer surfaced what Google calls a "fact-check snippet" depended on how you phrased the question and whether the topic had been fact-checked by an organization taking part in Google's program. The snippets aren't tags on specific stories but rather on search words or phrases that appear in the list of results.  Search "Obama Kenyan citizen" and a fact check snippet pops up from Snopes.com, detailing reasons why a purported Kenyan birth certificate for Obama was a fake.   Search "Obama birth certificate fake," however, and no snippet turns up. Instead, the first link is a story from WorldNetDaily, a site run by leading birther proponent Joseph Farah, which says that Obama's Hawaiian birth certificate was faked.  The responses highlight the difficulties the world's most popular search engine faces as it works to offer users more authoritative and credible information after being critiqued for returning fake and offensive information items in response to some queries. Google had been running a limited test fact check program in the United States and the United Kingdom for articles on news.google.com since October. The new roll-out applies to all searches worldwide — not just news — in all languages it supports. The inclusion of a fact-check topic won't affect the ranking of search results.  The information in the fact check tags comes from third-party fact-checking organizations. In the United States so far those include PolitiFact.org, FactCheck.org, Snopes.com, the Washington Post, the New York Times and GossipCop.com. Internationally there are between 50 and 100 groups offering tags, Google said. The fact checking doesn't just cover political stories, but a broader swathe, including science and health.  The search terms that trigger fact check snippets depend on whether a given topic has been the subject of a fact check and what words and phrases were tagged. While it's unclear if the results might sway those committed to a specific point of view, they give a sense of the power Google has to tailor search results for a specific purpose.  The Mountain View, Calif.-based search giant's move comes a month after Facebook began adding a "disputed" warning tag to some articles with no basis in fact. Thus far the fact check tags seem to be most often triggered by long-existing false stories. For example, a search in Google's main search box of the phrase "kidney theft" give a top return that links to a Snopes.com article debunking a popular, and false, Internet topic about unwary travelers being drugged and used as unwilling kidney donors by organ thieves.  Some political topics are also present. Searching on "national parks coal mining" give as its first return a snippet from Snopes titled "Did President Trump Open National Parks and Wildlife Refuges for Coal Mining?" and the label of "Mixed" as to its truth. President Trump did sign an executive order in March that overturned a temporary moratorium on the leasing of federal lands for coal mining, but Snopes noted that public lands had never been fully and permanently closed to such activity in the first place. The phrase "30 million undocumented immigrants" brings up Google fact-check snippets because during the presidential campaign, Trump made the claim that the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States could be much higher than the 11 million previously reported by the U.S. government. “It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million," Trump said in a speech in Phoenix in August. That number was actually pegged at 11.4 million by the federal government in 2012, a number corroborated by groups such as the non-partisan Pew Research Center. The system isn't partisan and any fact check organization that wants to can take part, as long as it abides by Google's terms of service for fact check snippets, Google says. They require that analysis "be transparent about sources and methods, with citations and references to primary sources." Each snippet also comes with a Feedback link for users to respond. Google has been under pressure, both internally and externally, to provide more authoritative and truthful results. In December after it emerged that a Holocaust-denying site was the first one that popped up when someone searched “Did the Holocaust happen?” the company changed its algorithm to “help surface more high quality, credible content on the web,” reported tech news site Search Engine Land. While such sites make up fewer than 1% of Google queries, the company clearly has begun to address the problem and has been putting a lot of resources into it, said Barry Schwartz, a news editor at Search Engine Land. “If someone’s searching for something specifically, even if it’s rumor and not true, Google wants to show them that authoritative sites believe it’s not factual,” Schwartz said.

WABC Tuesday, April 11, 2017 06:31PM MOUNT KISCO, Westchester County (WABC) -- A former Westchester County fire chief and current school employee is charged with child porn possession. Raymond Zaccari, 58, of Mount Kisco, was arrested on April 7 , 2017, after investigators executed a search warrant based on a CyberTipline report filed by Google. Google stated that a person using an IP address associated with Zaccari's home, where he lives with his wife and adult daughter, had uploaded an image of child pornography to an associated Google Plus Photos account. Zaccari is the former chief of the Mount Kisco Fire Department and was currently employed by the Rippowam Cisqua School in the Town of Bedford as a groundskeeper. He also worked as a school bus driver for the district's after-school activities and special events. After his arraignment, the school was contacted and informed of the arrest. Zaccari is charged with one count of promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child and one count of possessing an obscene sexual performance by a child. Bail was set at $25,000 cash over $50,000 bond. As a condition of his bail, he is not permitted to be around children under the age of 17. He is due back in court on April 20.

The US Department of Labor claimed yesterday that Google systematically discriminates against female staff, during a court case demanding Google gives up salary data for its employees. Eileen Naughton, VP of people operations at Google, responded to say the company has supplied "hundreds of thousands" of documents to the department, and that the accusations are baseless. "We were quite surprised when a representative of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs at the U.S. Department of Labor accused us of not compensating women fairly," she said. "We were taken aback by this assertion, which came without any supporting data or methodology. The OFCCP representative claimed to have reached this conclusion even as the OFCCP is seeking thousands of employee records, including contact details of our employees, in addition to the hundreds of thousands of documents we've already produced in response to 18 different document requests." Naughton said Google had shared its "top-level analysis" about the gender pay gap in 2016. She claimed that the annual analysis "is extremely scientific and robust" and that the methodology is available to other businesses. Each year Google suggests an amount for every employee's new compensation based on "role, job level, job location as well as current and recent performance ratings" and the analysts who calculate the suggested amount "do not have access to employees' gender data". Naughton explained: "Our pay equity model then looks at employees in the same job categories, and analyzes their compensation to confirm that the adjusted amount shows no statistically significant differences between men's and women's compensation." Naughton said that "our analysis gives us confidence that there is no gender pay gap at Google" and she added that Google hopes to work with the OFCCP to resolve the issue. 10/04/2017: Google denies claims of gender pay discrimination Google systematically discriminates against female staff, according to the US Department of Labor (DoL). The department said it has found that the company underpays its female workers, according to a Guardian report, in violation of federal laws. Google denies the claims. "The investigation is not complete," regional solicitor for the DoL Janet Herold told the Guardian, "but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters." "The government's analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry," she added. Regional director Janette Wipper testified in a San Francisco court last Friday that the department had discovered "systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce", according to the Guardian. Wipper claimed that a snapshot of salaries from 2015 showed evidence of disparities and that the government needed access to further payroll data, as well as confidential employee interviews, in order to successfully pinpoint the cause of the issue. "We vehemently disagree with Ms. Wipper's claim," a Google spokesperson told IT Pro. "Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn't provided any data, or shared its methodology." Google supplies services to the federal government as a contractor, meaning that it can be compelled by the government to hand over records of employee information, salary history and other data in accordance with compliance laws. However, the DoL claims that Google has consistently failed to release the data, forcing the department to issue a lawsuit against the company in January. A company spokesperson told Reuters that the requests were "overbroad in scope, or reveal confidential data". Google could face some serious consequences if the suit does not go its way; the DoL has asked the court to cancel all the company's existing federal contracts and bar it from future government business if it does not comply with the department's requests. These accusations are the latest reference to Silicon Valley's systemic discrimination problem. Tech companies like Uber have found themselves in hot water in recent months over allegations that they are allowing sexist behaviour to run rampant throughout their organisations.

Is Google really keeping fake listings off Google Maps? A recent study released by Google claims that fewer than 0.5% of local searches lead to fake listings. But is this number misleading? Columnist and local search expert Joy Hawkins takes a deep dive. Joy Hawkins on April 11, 2017 at 11:43 am More Google announced last week that they had recently conducted a study to research the actors behind fake listings on Google Maps. The study points out that “geographic proximity is the coin of the emerging localized-search realm,” which matches what I observed with the Possum update in 2016. This major algorithm update was responsible for making proximity to the searcher the #1 ranking factor for local search. This drives up the incentive for companies to create fake listings, since they need more “locations” in order to monopolize the search results and maximize exposure. There were some things I saw in the study that were very helpful to know: Most of the listings that got suspended were in India and the United States (74 percent of all the listings observed in this study). 40.3 percent of the listings were in industries that are on-call, like plumbers, locksmiths and electricians. 54 percent of the suspensions in the United States were in the following six states: California, New York, Florida, Texas, Illinois and New Jersey, while these states only account for 39.9 percent of the population. The study also looked at listings that were suspended due to marketing companies abusing the verification process and obtaining ownership of the listing without the consent of the business owner. This happens a lot in the restaurant industry, where marketing companies will create a copy of the business website and put a booking/ordering link on it, then charge the business owner for all orders placed via their system. They then take ownership of the listing via Google My Business, and the business owner is stuck paying for transactions from any customer finding their local listing on Google. To make matters worse, they refuse to transfer ownership of the listing to the restaurant owner when he finally figures all this out. When I first read the statement, “Our study shows that fewer than 0.5% of local searches lead to fake listings,” I actually laughed. But then I read the study and began to understand why they came to that conclusion: The study only looked at listings that were suspended. In collaboration with Google, we examine over a hundred-thousand business listings that appeared on Google Maps between June 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015 and were subsequently suspended for abuse. This didn’t look at all the listings the algorithm didn’t catch.  That statistic is not accurate whatsoever as a representation of all searches done on Google. They further state: In our study, we treat any listing that was in a suspended state at any time as abusive, while we treat all other currently active listings as legitimate. If Google’s algorithms were perfect and caught every single fake listing, this would be a good way to approach this. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. The study also states that they found 25.7 percent of abusive listings were in the locksmith category. This makes sense, since the algorithmic triggers for a suspension for locksmiths are not the same as for other industries. Google has been much harsher on locksmiths in the last year, and we see way more suspensions for them on the Google My Business forum. This is really more of an indicator that Google is penalizing locksmiths more than other industries, not necessarily that more spam exists in that industry. The announcement from Google highlights that they’ve reduced and disabled 85 percent of fake listings before they even appear on Google Maps. That statement is extremely misleading if you don’t realize they’re only referring to listings that Google’s algorithm actually caught, and in those cases, only 15 percent of the listings were live on Google Maps before getting suspended. It does not mean that Google actually catches 85 percent of fake listings. I agree that Google’s algorithms are getting smarter and better at catching spam. Nevertheless, here are the major issues with Maps spam that this study didn’t address. 1. Google My Business support issues The Google My Business phone support team seemingly lacks the ability to understand what spam is and how to detect it. I had a recent case of an attorney that I brought up to Google. This guy has over 20 fake listings at addresses that he rents via virtual office providers. They are all listed as open during regular business hours, and many of them aren’t within driving distance of one other. (In other words, you’d have to hop on a plane to get from one location to another.) Here’s the kicker: there are exactly two lawyers working at this firm. Please tell me how two attorneys are able to operate over 20 locations at the same time. This seems like common sense to me, but apparently not to Google, which decided to keep them all active. Advanced Verification will never solve the problems the algorithm doesn’t catch if the operators looking at the listings don’t know how to tell what’s real vs what’s not. It’s only launched in a few areas in California, and yet here are three examples from the last month that somehow passed advanced verification and shouldn’t have: A plumber in West Hollywood using a mailing service as his address A plumber in Los Angeles using the address of a mailbox store A locksmith in San Diego using a UPS store‘s address You would think that Google could see this pretty easily, since the mailing services are using the exact same address on their listing on Google Maps. 2. Virtual offices The number of fake listings I see on a regular basis using virtual offices is enormous, and these listings seem to go completely undetected by Google. I’m not sure I’ve ever witnessed a single case where listings got automatically flagged for using a virtual office service. Even when they are reported, these types of listings often get reinstated by the Google My Business support team. 3. Multiple listings that are set up using employees’ home addresses This is a common pattern I’ve seen on one business that has multiple listings. I had to argue with Google for months last year to get them to remove a listing for a marketing company in Toronto that set up multiple listings in multiple cities using the home addresses of their employees. They kept stating that the listings were legit, even after I called the business and asked for directions to their fake location (the girl on the phone was very confused) to confirm they didn’t exist there. 4. Keyword stuffing in business names This has been a spamming strategy that has worked well ever since Google Places first came into existence. There currently is no penalty in place for businesses that decide to add extra words to their business name to help with their ranking. Instead, they reap a ranking benefit until someone reports them. When reported, Google might actually remove the keywords from the title, but then the business owner can just go add them back via the Google My Business dashboard. 5. Review spam The number of fake reviews I’ve seen reported on the forums seems to be on the rise. It’s not just business owners who pay for fake positive reviews, but also people who leave negative reviews for their competitors, like the case that Casey Meraz looked at here. 6. Photo spam Spammers will upload tons of photos highlighting their services on the listings of their competitors. Tim Capper lists some examples here. Final thoughts I was happy to see Google release information that shows they are aware of some of the issues around Google Maps spam and are doing things to help fix it. However, until they decide to invest more in training and educating their support staff on spam, it seems that the users who attempt to report the spam that the algorithms missed will continue to feel like they are talking to a brick wall.

Patent 1 of 2: How Google learns to influence and control users Columnist Dave Davies does a deep dive into a recently granted Google patent that describes how your data and context could be used to influence your future actions. Dave Davies on April 11, 2017 at 12:00 pm More Two patents were recently granted to Google that paint a very interesting picture of the future of search. These patents are: Detecting and correcting potential errors in user behavior Guided purchasing via smartphone Before we dive in, I feel it’s necessary to point out that having a patent granted does not mean that Google will be implementing everything (or even anything) contained therein; however, it does illustrate areas they’re considering and willing to invest significant time and money into protecting. That said, these two patents contain ideas and technologies that strongly reflect the direction Google is currently heading in, and they point to a stronger monetization strategy on mobile and voice-first devices. In this two-part series, I will take you through some of the key points of each patent. Then, I’ll talk about how the information from these to patents combines to paint a picture of a future where search and task completion is very different than it is today. In this article, I’m going to focus on the first patent, “Detecting and correcting potential errors in user behavior.” To get a feel for the full scope of what Google is getting at here, I’ve highlighted excerpts from key sections of the patent, followed by my assessment of those sections. Abstract A computing system is described that predicts a future action to be taken by a user of a computing device and determines, based on contextual information associated with the computing device, a current action being taken by the user. The computing system determines, based on the current action, a degree of likelihood of whether the user will be able to take the future action and predicts, based on the degree of likelihood, that the user will not be able to take the future action. The computing system sends information to the computing device indicating that the current action being taken by the user will lead to the user not being able to take the future action. In the abstract, we understand that Google intends to take into account what we are presently doing and place that in the context of tasks we are likely to do in the future. If a current action is likely to interfere with an expected future task, then the user is notified via their device. The abstract doesn’t include what will happen when that event occurs, so we’ll just have to keep reading. Background Some computing devices (e.g., a wearable device or a mobile phone) may function as personal assistants that are configured to execute search queries for, or notify users about, upcoming flights, nearby attractions, and other information that may be of interest to a user. For example, a computing device may have access to a digital calendar of a user and the computing device may alert the user when to begin traveling from a current location to arrive on-time to a future meeting or event. Or in another example, a computing device may have access to a shopping history of a user and the computing device may suggest certain products or services that would work with a product purchased by the user in the past, as opposed to other products and services that would be incompatible with a past purchase. Nevertheless, even with all the helpful reminders and access to information that some computing devices provide, the reminders and access to information may not always prevent individual users from making decisions and taking certain actions that lead to mistakes being made in their everyday lives. The background of a patent basically outlines its “why,” or what problem it is attempting to solve. In the background here, we see Google acknowledge that, while today’s devices can alert users to upcoming events they may need to attend or recommend products based on past purchase history (I wonder why that’s specifically mentioned, don’t you?), the current technologies aren’t proactive in correcting users when their actions are not compatible with these events or needs. Summary Section 2 … the disclosure is directed to a method that includes predicting, by a computing system, a future action to be taken by a user of a computing device, determining, by the computing system, based on contextual information associated with the computing device, a current action being taken by the user, determining, by the computing system, based on the current action, a degree of likelihood of whether the user will be able to take the future action, and predicting, by the computing system, based on the degree of likelihood, that the user will not be able to take the future action. The method further includes sending, from the computing system, to the computing device, information indicating that the current action being taken by the user will lead to the user not being able to take the future action. While there are four parts to the summary it is in Section 2 that we get the picture of what Google is accomplishing with this patent.  Building on the background that the system they are describing will detect when actions being taken are likely to prevent future actions the user is expected to take, here we see that Google will send to the user an indication that their current actions will prevent future ones. This might not seem altogether interesting; however, as we dive further in, we’ll start to understand the full reach, influence and power that they are talking about. Detailed description You’re going to see some numeric references below, such as “device 110.” These numbers relate to the figures included with the patent.  While most aren’t specifically relevant to understanding what is being discussed (in our context), I don’t want you feeling like you’re missing anything, so I’ll include the figures above where they’re first referenced. Let’s begin with figure 1. Now let’s get back to what the patent covers … Section 25 For example, notification data may include, but is not limited to, information specifying an event such as: the receipt of a communication message (e.g., e-mail, instant message, SMS, etc.) by a messaging account associated with a computing device, the receipt of information by a social networking account associated with computing device 110, a reminder of a calendar event (meetings, appointments, etc.) associated with a calendar account of computer device 110, information generated and/or received by a third-party application executing at computing device 110, the transmittal and/or receipt of inter-component communications between two or more components of platforms, applications, and/or services executing at computing device 110, etc. The sections between 2 and 25, while interesting, reinforced the points note previously. In section 25, however, we get a bit of interesting information. Google mentions the use of communication systems built into the device, as well as social network account data and other third-party applications and services on the devices accessed by the user. Basically, the patent is built on the idea that all data from virtually any source can be used to determine expected actions a user is likely to take. Section 31 Examples of contextual information include past, current, and future physical locations, degrees of movement, magnitudes of change associated with movement, weather conditions, traffic conditions, patterns of travel, patterns of movement, application usage, calendar information, purchase histories, Internet browsing histories, and the like … In some examples, contextual information may include communication information such as information derived from e-mail messages, text messages, voice mail messages or voice conversations, calendar entries, task lists, social media network related information, and any other information about a user or computing device that can support a determination of a user context. In discussing understanding the context of actions, Google adds in section 31 the idea of taking into account the motion of the user’s device and external factors such as weather and purchase histories (there it is again). Once more, we see wide varieties of contextual data sources used, but here we also see the inclusion of voice conversation and voice mail. Privacy concerns aside, that’s a lot of data — especially when we consider that “voice conversations” doesn’t necessarily mean “on the phone” simply because it’s listed right after voice mail. Section 34 Context module 162 may maintain past and future contextual histories associated with the user of computing device 110. Context module 162 may catalog and record previous contexts of computing device 110 at various locations and times in the past and from the previously recorded contexts, may project or infer future contexts of computing device 110 at various future locations and future times. Context module 162 may associate future days and future times with the recurring contexts of prior days and times to build a future contextual history associated with the user of computing device 110. In section 34, we’re seeing an expansion of the ideas presented previously into the unscheduled world. Until this point in the patent, we’ve generally read Google determining future events using data gathered from various sources (social media, text, voice, etc.). Here, however, we’re seeing this expanded to the system gaining an understanding of patterns based on past and present behavior — and establishing from that what the user is expected to do. Section 36 Context module 162 may supplement a future contextual history associated with the user of computing device 110 with information stored on an electronic calendar or information mined from other communications information associated with computing device 110. For example, the electronic calendar may include a location associated with an event or appointment occurring at a future time or day when the user is typically at a home location. Rather than include the home location during the future time or day of the event as the expected location in the future contextual history, context module 162 may include event location as the expected location during the future time or day of the event. In Section 36, we see the bridge of user behavior established by “watching” our patterns from Section 34 and combining that with the event and calendar information mined from other sources to override habitual patterns with known upcoming events that may disrupt our daily activity. Section 39 As part of a prediction service accessed by computing device 110, prediction module 164 may automatically output notification data or other information to notification module 122 of computing device 110 for alerting a user of a correction that the user could take to a current action as a way to ensure that a future action is taken. Said differently, prediction module 164 may determine whether a current action being performed by a user in a current context is more likely or less likely to lead to the user being able to perform a future action in a future context. In Section 39, we simply see the output: Google notifying the user that an action they are taking now may impact the ability to perform a future action. Section 40 In summary, prediction module 164 may perform one or more machine learning techniques to learn and model actions that users of computing device 110 and other computing devices typically take for different contexts. Through learning and modeling actions for different contexts, prediction module 164 may generate one or more rules for predicting actions that the user of computing device 110 takes for a particular context. In Section 40, the patent discusses the use of machine learning and modeling to determine and predict possible actions being performed. In other sections of the patent, we read such examples as using the motion and location of a device to determine the user is standing in line at an airport (and what the context of that action would predict). In Section 44, we see a very helpful example: the system detecting that the user has overslept when they have a flight and thus alerting them to this fact before it’s too late to catch it, given current conditions (time to airport, time to get through the gates, etc.). Section 53 [U]nlike other computing devices and systems that simply provide reminders and access to information but may still allow a user to go in a direction or to take an action that could lead to a mistake being made in their everyday lives, the example system takes additional steps to ensure that mistakes are avoided and the future actions associated with the reminders and information are actually accomplished. Even if the user is unaware that he or she is making a mistake, the example system will still automatically provide information to guide the user back to avoid making the mistake. Here, we see something fairly straightforward but that needs to be illustrated as we approach Section 54. The system is designed to actively provide information that will allow a user to avoid making a mistake, even if they are unaware of said mistake to begin with. A very pleasant idea, to be sure, but here’s where it gets dangerous… Section 54 Consequently, the user need not even be aware he or she is making a mistake, the computing system can infer whether the user may need to take corrective action to a current action without user input. The user may experience less stress and spend less time going down the wrong path towards a future action and less time correcting course to avoid making a mistake. By correcting potential mistakes earlier rather than later, the example system may enable the computing device to receive fewer inputs from a user searching for information to try and correct or rectify a mistake. It’s the first line of this section that might be considered dangerous. The patent suggests that the system allows for the “correcting of behavior” without the need for the end user to even be aware that they are being corrected. Let that sink in for a second: you do not need to be aware that a system controlled by Google is adjusting your actions without your knowledge, based on what it determines you are or should be doing. Before we continue, there will be references to elements on Figure 2. An understanding of these figures is not necessary for our purposes here but may be helpful to some, or at least help you know you’re not missing anything. So, before we continue, here’s Figure 2: Section 66 Task and needs rules data store 270C includes one or more previously developed rules that needs prediction module 264 relies on to predict a task or action likely to be performed by a user of a computing device for a current context as well as information that the user may need to accomplish the task. For example, data store 270C may store rules of a machine learning or artificial intelligence system of needs prediction module 264. The machine learning or artificial intelligence system of needs prediction module 264 may access the rules of data store 270C to infer tasks and needs associated with users of computing device 110 for a particular context. Section 66 is fairly straightforward: the patent reads that machine learning and/or AI will be used to determine the most likely tasks being performed based on past models of behavior and to weight that against their impact on performing a future task. This includes establishing likely tasks and needs associated with that future event to determine if the user has completed all things that need to be completed prior to engaging in that future event. This may include things like stopping at the gas station to fill up the night before a flight when the flight is scheduled to take off at 6:30 in the morning. It’s worth noting that in other sections not included here, these machine learning and AI systems are constantly training in understanding global patterns, as well as patterns unique to individuals. Section 72 [P]rediction module 264 may input the current context, previously determined future context, current action, and expected or future action into action rules data store 270C and receive an indication of a degree of likelihood as to whether the user should be able to drop of dry cleaning he or she will need to attend the event the next day and still be able to attend the event the next day. … action rules data store 270C may output a low degree of likelihood (e.g., a probability less than 50%) since the dry cleaner is closed the next day and therefore the user will be unable to pickup his or her dry cleaning for the event. Here’s my favorite part and where it all comes together for Google. In this section, we see a user dropping off dry cleaning, and the system has predicted it is for an event the user has the next day. Knowing the dry cleaner is closed the following day, Google employs the corrective action of suggesting a nearby dry clearer that will be open the following day. I imagine that suggestion, which would likely be auditory, would sound something like: Google Assistant: The dry cleaner you are arriving at will be closed tomorrow. Is this for the event tomorrow night? User: Yes it is. Google Assistant: Billy’s Dry Cleaning is two blocks away. Would you like me to enter that as your new destination? (Insert a subtle notice on the display the user isn’t actually looking at because they’re driving, indicating Billy’s Dry Cleaning has paid for the ad.) User: Yes. I don’t know that they would actually hide the ad notification, obviously, but this is one of the areas where Google could easily influence buying decisions based on AdWords investment. Section 89 ISS 160 may determine that the user is interacting with computing device 110 to purchase tickets for one event that will overlap and prevent attendance of another event for which the user has already purchased tickets and cause computing device 110 to warn the user of the potential mistake. ISS 160 may be aware of more than just start and stop times of events for determining potential conflicts. For example, the rules of prediction module 164 may learn from prior observations of other users of other computing devices that even though the start time of an event is at a particular time, reserved seating for the event opens up fifteen minutes before the actual start time, and if attendees are not at the event fifteen minutes early, the reserved seats open up to other event goers. So that even if the official start and end times of two events do not overlap, ISS 160 may warn a user of computing device 110 of a potential conflict in booking tickets for the two events if the end time of the earlier event overlaps with the “unofficial” start time (e.g., the reserved seating time) of the event. This section is incredibly important in function and utility. In this section, we see the system able to understand the less formal aspects of human life, such as unofficial times to be at events. I presume this would include considering the average time it takes to get through customs on arrival at LAX to have an Uber waiting for me as I’m leaving, but not sitting there for 30 minutes because it was ordered based on the time my plane was scheduled to land. The stage is set In the patent summary above, we’ve set the stage. In part two (to be published next week), we’ll be looking at a second patent that involves guided purchasing. That is, Google predicting the type of information you’ll need to make a purchase based on general user behavior combined with your own personal patterns and past purchases and “guiding” you to the “right decision.” It’s an extremely exciting patent for paid search marketers — as implemented by Google, it would add enormous control over your ads and how and when they’re triggered. But before going there, we needed to understand this first patent and how it’s designed to influence users’ core behavior. Soon, we’ll see how this all comes together into one glorious monetization strategy for Google, with more ads displayed and more ads selected by users at critical decision-making points.

The company said it conducts “rigorous analyses” that its pay practices are gender-blind and found “no gender pay gap” in 52 major job categories it analyzed last year. Google added that analysts who calculate suggested pay don’t have access to employees’ gender data. Google also said that beyond gender pay equity, the company recently expanded the analysis to cover race in the U.S. as well. The U.S. Department of Labor had accused Google of shortchanging women doing similar work to men, saying it found “systemic compensation disparities” across the company’s workforce. Sponsored Content: Why Governance, Risk and Compliance is Everyone’s Business - Download the Executive Brief Today. Advertisement Google responded in a blog post Tuesday that the department’s assertion “came without any supporting data or methodology.” The company said it had already produced hundreds of thousands of documents in response to 18 separate requests, and the government is seeking thousands more, including contact details of employees. The department had no comment, saying the case is ongoing. The difference between Google’s and the Labor Department’s claims might come down to how each side defines pay discrimination, Tim Worstall, a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute in London, wrote in a recent post for Forbes. “Google is using a strict definition of ‘same job’ to find no gender pay gap. The Department of Labor is using a looser definition of ‘similar job’ to find that there is one,” he wrote. “Who you think is right here is entirely up to you but that’s where the disagreement is.” Topics: All News Business News Technology News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Business News » Google refutes charges, says… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Today in History 1970: Apollo 13 launched to the moon Fed Photo of the Day Helicopter fills bucket for firefighting Top Stories White House ends hiring freeze, mandates workforce, mission restructuring Top Story First round of email records reporting holds mirror to agencies’ management practices Management Army let go of nearly 700 soldiers in the second half of 2016 to meet requirements Defense News SEC sees transition as opportunity to involve employees in engagement improvements Workforce GSA’s buildings exchange projects need more risk planning, revised reports, funding requirements Facilities/Construction THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN TICKER Apr 11, 2017 Close Change YTD L Income 18.7353 0.0092 1.73% L 2020 25.1826 0.0181 2.91% L 2030 27.9152 0.0280 4.13% L 2040 29.9860 0.0352 4.73% L 2050 17.1575 0.0222 5.28% G Fund 15.2871 0.0010 0.59% F Fund 17.7193 0.0643 0.93% C Fund 32.6498 -0.0421 6.07% S Fund 42.7674 0.2069 4.57% I Fund 26.3570 0.1016 7.35% Closing price updated at approx 6pm EST. each business day.

Associated Press NEW YORK — Google says it’s “taken aback “ by the government’s claim that it doesn’t compensate women fairly. The company says it conducts “rigorous analyses” that its pay practices are gender-blind. It says analysts who calculate suggested pay don’t have access to employees’ gender data. Google says it analyzed 52 major job categories last year and found “no gender pay gap.” The U.S. Department of Labor had accused Google of shortchanging women doing similar work to men, saying it found “systemic compensation disparities” across the company’s workforce. In a blog post Tuesday, Google said that beyond gender pay equity, the company recently expanded the analysis to cover race in the U.S. as well. The department had no comment, saying the case is ongoing. A Labor Department disclosed the agency’s allegations during a Friday court hearing in San Francisco. “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified. Google and other technology companies have been trying to improve hiring practices that have historically doled out most of their technical jobs to white and Asian men. Their efforts to strike a better balance have been mostly unsuccessful so far. For instance, only 19 percent of Google’s technology jobs are held by women. Overall, nearly one-third of Google’s more than 70,000 workers are women.   The Labor Department’s probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers’ privacy. While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. The Labor Department is now scrutinizing Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts. Earlier this year, the Labor Department also sued Oracle, alleging that the business software maker routinely pays white male workers more than their female and non-white counterparts for comparable jobs.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Google Wants Women to Just Trust That It Pays Them the Same as Men Sidney FussellYesterday 11:46am Filed to: sexism google department of labor Gender pay gap 80 3 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Just a trustworthy bunch of fellas. (Photo: AP) In the midst of an ugly legal battle with the Department of Labor over the gender wage gap, Google updated its blog on Tuesday to assert its commitment to paying women and men at the company equally. For a company with totally unremarkable diversity numbers, Google is weirdly nonspecific about how it addresses pay inequity in the post, saying both that it doesn’t underpay women, but won’t support having a third-party certify that. Advertisement The allegations date back to January, when the Department of Labor filed suit against Google for employment income data as part of a federally mandated review to make sure women and men are paid the same at the company. Since September, Google has repeatedly refused to give the agency the data, claiming that the request violates employee privacy and that Google’s own internal audits found no pay discrimination. The Department of Labor, however, asserts that women are grossly underpaid compared to men at the company. Advertisement Janet Herold, a solicitor for the agency, told The Guardian that the government’s preliminary investigation found that “discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry.” If Google continues withholding the data, they risk losing all federal contracts and being barred from all future federal work until they hand it over. Regardless, Google isn’t budging, claiming that the government couldn’t possibly have discovered a pay disparity because it has incomplete records—the entirety of which Google refuses to hand over. Tuesday’s (only slightly passive aggressive) blog post reads: We were taken aback by this assertion, which came without any supporting data or methodology. The [Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs] representative claimed to have reached this conclusion even as the OFCCP is seeking thousands of employee records, including contact details of our employees, in addition to the hundreds of thousands of documents we’ve already produced in response to 18 different document requests. But Google’s methodology for calculating employee compensation is not “gender blind,” as it cringingly asserts. According to the blog post, employee compensation is suggested by a number of factors, including “current and recent performance ratings.” Although salary is calculated by analysts who can’t see employee gender, they factor in performance ratings which themselves are subjective and shaped by biases. Google also acknowledges that managers have “limited discretion to adjust” the final compensation level that analysts suggest. It’s almost ridiculous to assert that gender plays absolutely no part in performance or ratings when there’s such an enormous gender disparity at the company, with an 80 percent male tech labor force. Wouldn’t that play out in performance ratings? How does Google audit performance ratings for gender bias? How do they know such heavily skewed environments don’t affect performance in the first place? The company hasn’t answered these questions and according to the Department of Labor, Google’s problems are systemic, not incidental. Sponsored Obviously, the problem is much bigger than just Google. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which files suit against discriminating companies, will start collecting data on income and gender in 2018 to identify wage gaps. Given the rampant problems of sexism in tech, even among feminist-identifying companies, there are many more legal battles (and awkward PR pivots like this) to come.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 April 2017 by Military News Springfield Illinois Reason #36 Why Outsourcing Your International Custom Blog-Content Creation and Reputation Management Needs to www.G3-Development.co Is Beautiful Springfield, IL — (SBWIRE) — 04/11/2017 — Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine’s „natural” or un-paid („organic”) search results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine’s users. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines. As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic. Webmasters and content providers began optimizing sites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Initially, all webmasters needed to do was to submit the address of a page, or URL, to the various engines which would send a „spider” to „crawl” that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be indexed. The process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine’s own server, where a second program, known as an indexer, extracts various information about the page, such as the words it contains and where these are located, as well as any weight for specific words, and all links the page contains, which are then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date. Springfield Illinois Reason #36 Why Outsourcing Your International Custom Blog-Content Creation and Reputation Management Needs to http://www.G3-Development.co/ is Beautiful By 2004, search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in their ranking algorithms to reduce the impact of link manipulation. In June 2007, The New York Times’ Saul Hansell stated Google ranks sites using more than 200 different signals. The leading search engines, Google, Bing, and Yahoo, do not disclose the algorithms they use to rank pages. Some SEO practitioners have studied different approaches to search engine optimization, and have shared their personal opinions.  Patents related to search engines can provide information to better understand search engines. In 2005, Google began personalizing search results for each user. Depending on their history of previous searches, Google crafted results for logged in users. In 2008, Bruce Clay said that „ranking is dead” because of personalized search. He opined that it would become meaningless to discuss how a website ranked, because its rank would potentially be different for each user and each search. In December 2009, Google announced it would be using the web search history of all its users in order to populate search results. Google Instant, real-time-search, was introduced in late 2010 in an attempt to make search results more timely and relevant. Historically site administrators have spent months or even years optimizing a website to increase search rankings. With the growth in popularity of social media sites and blogs the leading engines made changes to their algorithms to allow fresh content to rank quickly within the search results. In February 2011, Google announced the Panda update, which penalizes websites containing content duplicated from other websites and sources. Historically websites have copied content from one another and benefited in search engine rankings by engaging in this practice, however Google implemented a new system which punishes sites whose content is not unique.  In April 2012, Google launched the Google Penguin update the goal of which was to penalize websites that used manipulative techniques to improve their rankings on the search engine.

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. Even though Google has announced that the Motorola-made Nexus 6 will not be receiving anymore operating system updates in the future, a special Android O build for Nexus 6 has been spotted in Google’s code. The build we are talking about has been codenamed as “Shamu” and it’s being developed right now. However, Nexus 6 owners shouldn’t get too excited since they will more than likely never receive Android O. Android O for Nexus 6 As previously mentioned, Nexus 6 has reached its end of its update life. This means that Google has decided to not roll out any important software updates to the smartphone anymore. However, the Android parent has guaranteed that Nexus 6 owners will still receive monthly security updates all throughout 2017. We believe that the sole reason why Google is developing a special Android O build that’s compatible with Nexus 6 is to test out security bulletins. The new build will allow Google to test out its monthly security patches and make sure that they aren’t filled with bugs or glitches. We should also mention that Google might actually change its mind and roll out Android O to Nexus 6 but once again, this is highly unlikely. After a close inspection, the Shamu code looks to be in a primary stage. This means that it features the basic elements but the smartphone’s hardware isn’t registered. For example, Nexus 6’s Adreno 420 graphics processing unit is nowhere to be found and neither its network hardware. Nexus 6 As a memory refresh, Nexus 6 ships with a rather large 5.96 inch AMOLED panel that offers a high pixel resolution of 1440 x 2560 and a pixel density of 493 ppi. The screen to body ratio is 74.1 percent and the display has been coated in Corning Gorilla Glass 3. In terms of hardware power, Nexus 6 impresses with its Qualcomm quad-core Snapdragon 805 chipset. The chipset has been clocked at 2.7GHz Krait 450 and it’s paired with an Adreno 420 graphics processing unit and 3GB of RAM. We should also mention that Nexus 6 is fueled by a big non-removable Li-Po 3,220 mAh battery.

That's why we've put our heads together to come up with a range of improvements we'd like to see included in the Huawei P11 when it inevitably launches. It's a long way off for now, but below you'll find all of the early rumors and news about the Huawei P11, alongside the things we'd most like to see on the upcoming Huawei phone. Cut to the chase What is it? Huawei's next flagship phone When is it out? In 2018, expect it at MWC next year What will it cost? Over $600 or £500, if it's like the Huawei P10 Huawei P11 price and release date The Huawei P11 is expected to launch at the start of 2018, but little else is known about the phone so far. Huawei's VP of Handsets Product Line, Bruce Lee, told Android Central the company will "probably launch devices at Mobile World Congress" in future. The next MWC will be at the end of February 2018, a year after the launch of the Huawei P10. At the time of writing, the Huawei P10 has only just been released, so we'd expect some major improvements by the time of the P11. In terms of price, it's not currently clear what Huawei will do - but we hope to see the price drop for the next version. The Huawei P10 costs around £570 (roughly $710/AU$945), but wasn't released in the US.  Huawei P11: what we want to see Here's everything we have our fingers crossed to see on the Huawei P11. 1. A voice assistant The Huawei P10 didn't come with an easy to use voice assistant. Amazon Alexa is available on the Huawei Mate 9 in the US, but not on the P10, and currently Google Assistant isn't available for the Huawei P10 either. The lack of Google Assistant is a shame, but Huawei is aiming to get Google's helper onto the phone at a later date. We hope Huawei settles on what voice assistant should be used on the Huawei P11, and that it launches with one on day one. 2. Better battery life One of our main criticisms of the Huawei P10 was the poor battery life.  We found it to be a touch worse than the Huawei P9 that went before it, so we hope that Huawei puts a lot of effort in to increase the battery life on the Huawei P11. 3. A better USP Perhaps the biggest problem with the Huawei P10 was the lack of a big selling point. There's no particular reason to buy this phone - it's just all round a good handset, and we'd like to see an improved USP ready for the P11. What exactly that should be, we're not entirely certain. Hopefully Huawei has something up its sleeve to help tackle the big selling features that other companies such as Samsung and Apple offer. 4. Lower price Huawei has been steadily increasing its prices for the past few years and the P10 is one of the most expensive phones the company has made. We hope that for the Huawei P11 the company decides to drop the price down a little, to make it a more appetizing buy compared to the other flagship devices on the market. 5. Google Daydream support The Huawei P10 doesn't work with a virtual reality headset, so we hope the next phone from Huawei will be a part of Google's Daydream program and connect with the Google Daydream View headset. Huawei has previously confirmed it's working on a virtual reality headset too, but there's been no official announcement so far on where the headset is in production. 6. A US release That's a pretty simple one, but it's a big shame the Huawei P10 never officially launched in the US and we'd like to see that be a priority for the P11.

Zeman   @phonescooper Looking to tap into your creative side and have some social fun with your smartphone camera? Here are a handful of third-party apps we like when we're in the mood to flex our shutterbug muscles, especially when sharing via social networks is concerned. AD       article continues below... Photography is one of my many artistic passions. Smartphones have really helped foster this passion by putting a powerful camera in my pocket day and night. Now, I can snap a shot whenever the opportunity presents itself (and timing is everything). I'm certainly no Ansel Adams, but I like to think I snag fun or interesting shots from time to time. Whether Android or iOS is your operating system of choice, app makers have plenty on offer. This particular collection of recommendations leans more towards fun and sharing than it does serious photography. Each app lets you go beyond what stock cameras can. 1. Clips Clips lets iPhone owners capture and assemble a pastiche of photos and videos, apply effects, and then share them. Clips Clips is brand new and only became available in the last week. My 12-year-old and her friends are already in love with it. The app offers a plethora of tools. The default action is to capture selfies, but you can easily switch to the main camera or access photos/videos from the camera roll. Once you've selected and arranged the images you want, you can add text bubbles, filters, graphics, transitions, and even music soundtracks. It takes practice. I was hoping arranging photos and videos would be a bit easier. For example, I found I couldn't rearrange photos/videos I'd already added to the Clip, which forced me to start over to get them in the order I wanted. Still, it's fairly straightforward. Of course, it goes without saying that sharing to most social networks (and iMessage in particular) is a breeze. (iTunes) 2. Prisma Prisma is for filter fiends. If you want to take your original image and apply PhotoShop-quality filters to it, Prisma is the app for you. Prisma Prisma relies on neural networks and artificial intelligence to apply dramatic, artistic filters to images. Prisma's filters go way beyond tweaking brightness, exposure, color, and focus. No, Prisma applies readily-identifiable artistic styles to your photos, such as Cubism and Impressionism, and modern styles like Gothic or Anime. The default action is to take a new photo, but you can switch to the selfie camera or access your camera roll easily enough. The filters take several seconds apply, so the app takes some patience when using. I find it simple enough to use and the results are lots of fun. When it comes to sharing, Prisma has taken a turn of late. The app used to simply apply filters, but now it hooks into Facebook and lets you share photos to your own feed as well as follow the feeds of others. It's trying a bit too much to be Instagram here, but I still like the app for how it treats photos. (Play Store, iTunes) Prisma Sample 3. Boomerang Boomerang gives photos some life. It allows you to record about one second of motion and then loop it back and forth, before sharing with others. Boomerang The effect can be neat. The idea is to find something or someone that is moving (train, kid, car, cat, dog) and capture the action. Rather than video, Boomerang snags a burst of 10 photos and turns them into a miniature movie. The app does all the stitching automatically. It runs the video forward and then backward over and over and over. Boomerang can be especially delightful if you time your shot just right and capture someone sneezing or tripping. The results are only ever as good as the source material. Did I mention you can use either the main or selfie cams to capture the action? Like other photo apps, sharing from Boomerang to a variety of social networks is a breeze. (Play Store, iTunes) This is a test too A post shared by Eric Z (@phonescooper) on Apr 11, 2017 at 7:24am PDT 4. Google Cardboard Camera Google wants the future of photography to be multidimensional and I do, too. Cardboard Camera Google got its virtual reality start with Cardboard, a simple cardboard viewer that allows most any smartphone to view VR content. Cardboard has since evolved into DayDream, but the latter is only available to the latest flagship phones. Cardboard is still available to everyone and the Google Cardboard Camera app lets you easily capture 360-degree photos with Android and iOS phones, no fancy 360-degree camera required. I've used this app extensively when traveling over the last year, including on vacation in the mountains and on work trips to Berlin, Las Vegas, and Barcelona. The 360-degree images, which are easy to backup and share via Google Photos, include sound to give your shot that extra something special. The sound (which is optional) really helps recreate the ambience of the actual space in which the photo was taken. Peering at 360-degree images taken with the Cardboard Camera app via the Cardboard viewer is a neat experience all around (pun intended). Google Cardboard is your best starting point if you're ready to dip your toes into virtual reality and/or 360-degree landscapes. (Play Store, iTunes) 360-Degree Shot 5. Motion Stills Motion Stills is a Google app for iPhones that gives Live Photos more staying power. Motion Stills Live Photos on an iPhone are really short videos that masquerade as photos. At its simplest, snapping a photo in Live Photo mode captures a second or so of video. The result is a moving picture so you can see what was really happening when you tried to pose the entire family for that holiday portrait. Apple's Live Photos are neat, but lack universal sharing tools. As of now, Live Photos can be shared via Facebook and through Apple's own Photos and iMessage apps. Live Photos are somewhat trapped in the Apple ecosystem. Enter Motion Stills. First, Motion Stills take Live Photos and turn them into looping GIFs that can be shared across apps and platforms. That's a big deal all by itself, and means your Android-using relatives can now enjoy your miniature creative works. Motion Stills also lets you paste together multiple Live Photos to create a longer movie, if you wish. The app includes stabilization, advanced rendering to smooth out gaps and create seamless stitches, and the ability to select the thumbnail image. If you love Live Photos, Motion Stills is a must for taking your moving pictures to the next level. (iTunes) Live Photo Turned Into GIF via Motion Stills 6. Layout This universal app is for creating collages. It lets you easily and quickly piece together multiple photos into a single image and then share that image. Layout Layout was created by (and for) Instagram, but it functions fine without the bigger app on board. I find this app is great for assembling images to tell a story in one shot. The app has a simple image picker, allowing you to put between 2 and 9 images in the frame. I really like that Layout includes almost a dozen different… layouts. This lets you choose which images are given visual prominence over others. You can also flip individual images in the collage horizontally or vertically, as well as add and adjust borders to help separate the pictures from one another. The app includes a dedicated button to launch the selfie camera, as well as access to the photo gallery, and a tool that sorts through faces and/or people. This is really helpful if you're looking to create a collage of your friends and family. Once you're all done, the app includes lines for sharing directly to Instagram or Facebook, as well as SMS, email, Twitter, and so on. (Play Store, iTunes) G6 v S8 A post shared by Eric Z (@phonescooper) on Apr 11, 2017 at 6:52am PDT 7. Instagram Instagram may be the most obvious camera app to recommend, but I do so with good reason: it's the most feature-rich and the most social. Instagram Instagram started small. It allowed you to take pictures, apply one of several old-timey filters, and share the photos with others on Instagram. Now, Instagram allows you to snap photos or videos, perform full edits, apply tons of filters, share pictures privately, create short-lived stories, and push images to every corner of the web. The app may not be as simple and pure as it once was, but its reach is undeniable. Instagram is owned by Facebook and lets everyone tap into their Facebook account for quickly expanding their network. It's also wildly popular with celebrities and A-listers, which makes it fun for regular folks to use even if all you ever do is casually scroll through posts from Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian, and Justin Bieber. Instagram's 400 million users can't (all) be wrong. If you're not already on Instagram, you should be.

Google Fact-Checking May Serve MSMGoogle's plan to apply an algorithmic fact-checking tool to its Google News service could lead to censorship, the German Pirate Party told Sputnik Deutschland. Its chairman Patrick Schiffer told Sputnik Deutschland that while the party welcomes the principle of Google's fact check, there are concerns about the way in which this is being implemented. "Google announced the Google News fact check last year and has been expanding it over the last few months," Schiffer said. "While I found the idea quite interesting, there are of course some questions which arise. One of them is, 'Will the news remain available for reading, or will it disappear?' Under no circumstances should these contributions disappear, there should be no censorship under any circumstances." "The basis for the evaluation of 'fake news' is very narrow. That is, it is being done automatically which is a big problem if Google programs the algorithms so that the burden of proof is on the publishers." "Then the company can't be blamed for any distortions (of the truth), but this could present problems with regard to how consistently Google will apply this principle." From the outset of the project, Google needs to publish "comprehensive and transparent criteria" for choosing partners in the fact-checking exercise, which also give smaller blogs and news websites a chance to join the project, Schiffer said. © Flickr/ Bryan Pocius Iceland’s Pirate Party 'Super Excited, Humbled' About Mandate to Form Gov'tSo far, the tech giant has joined forces with 115 fact-checking organizations such as the BBC, NPR and PolitiFact. The Pirates say that in the longer term, the fight against "fake news" must address issues of computer literacy. "In the longer term, there is a need to introduce compulsory computer science in schools. The problem of media competency needs to be strengthened both with regard to teacher training and student education. These are all issues which politics has very much neglected over the past few years. We are calling for the effects of digitization, which have already been apparent for decades, to finally be addressed," Schiffer said. The German Pirate Party was established in September 2006 following the establishment of the first Pirate Party in Sweden in January 2006. It is represented in several German state parliaments and in the European Parliament.  Like other members of the Pirate Party International collective, it calls for the protection and enhancement of civil rights, including free speech and data protection.  Never miss a story again — sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed! ...

But alas, we don’t live in normal political times. Partisanship between Right and Left is the highest it’s ever been in the modern era. Republicans and Democrats occupy ground on either side of a widening ideological chasm that many political scientists and analysts believe has grown too big to bridge. One major reason for the existence of the divide and its yawning gap is the so-called “mainstream media,” which was always Left-leaning but which has exposed itself since the election of Donald J. Trump as nothing more than a propaganda instrument for the Marxist Democratic Party. (RELATED: Washington Post Caught In Blatant Fake News LIE, Forced To Change Article) The mainstream’s narrative following Trump’s historic win was that he was assisted, in large part not by Hillary Clinton’s uninspiring, criminally investigated campaign, but by a host of “fake news” that wildly distorted her views and records while promoting Trump and downplaying his flaws. Google and other social media sites, such as Facebook, then came under fire from other media for not filtering out the allegedly false news surrounding Trump and Clinton. What to do? The “solution” was to merge with other media to “fact-check” news stories running on their massive news feeds. But the goal has never been to fact-check the mainstream outlets; no. The only ones “fact-checked” are going to be the pesky alternative media sources who scored bombshell after bombshell during the campaign, as the only news sites willing to scrutinize Clinton properly. Google – along with the other social media behemoth, Facebook – is clearly in the camp of the Marxists, so any notion that the company plans to be fair and accurate when it comes to telling readers what is and is not valid news should be dispensed with. We can tell there is no effort to be fair because of who the company has chosen to “fact-check” the news: Outlets themselves who have demonstrated a propensity to publish fake news. As noted by The Daily Wire: Who are the vaunted checkers, the ones charged with sussing out the truth and stating it without bias? Salon. Buzzfeed. Snopes. The Washington Post. Politifact. Seriously. Couldn’t they find more liberal “news” sites?  Google calls them “authoritative sources.” Snopes? Buzzfeed? And The Washington Post of today is nothing like it was 40 years ago. Jeff Bezos has taken the paper far left, and it’s day-to-day content skews hardcore liberal. Take as an example, some information that was “fact-checked” by Snopes. If you look up the phrase, “Hillary Clinton sold uranium to Russia” on Google, the results will return a small icon at the bottom that says, “Fact-check by Snopes.com: False.” (RELATED: Check out the truth about Snopes.com at Truthwiki.org) False? As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton was one of several government officials who oversaw and approved the sale of one-fifth of U.S. strategic uranium reserves to a state-owned Russian company (all while millions in donations flowed to the Clinton Foundation). How true is it? From The New York Times: Whether the donations played any role in the approval of the uranium deal is unknown. But the episode underscores the special ethical challenges presented by the Clinton Foundation, headed by a former president who relied heavily on foreign cash to accumulate $250 million in assets even as his wife helped steer American foreign policy as secretary of state, presiding over decisions with the potential to benefit the foundation’s donors. …[T]he ultimate authority to approve or reject the Russian acquisition rested with the cabinet officials on the foreign investment committee, including Mrs. Clinton — whose husband was collecting millions in donations from people associated with Uranium One. [Emphasis added]. Maybe Clinton didn’t sell the uranium herself, but she certainly had a hand in approving the sale. Not false. Don’t be duped by these media fakes.

This follows news that the US Department of Labor found evidence of “systemic compensation disparities”, where female employees were disadvantaged. Google said that, each year, it suggests an amount for every employee’s new compensation based on role, job level, job location, and current and recent performance ratings. This suggested amount is “blind” to gender – the analysts who calculate the suggested amounts do not have access to employees’ gender data. An employee’s manager has limited discretion to adjust the suggested amount, providing they cite a legitimate adjustment rationale. “Our pay equity model then looks at employees in the same job categories and analyses their compensation to confirm that the adjusted amount shows no statistically significant differences between men’s and women’s compensation,” said Google.

Motorola’s sub-$100 phone [Specs, Details, Rumors] Chris Burns - Apr 11, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Step aside, Moto G, there’s a new super-inexpensive smartphone in Motorola’s vision for the future. Having seen quite a bit of success with the Moto G line for the past several years, it would seem that Motorola (now owned by Lenovo) will hit it even lower than before. While Moto G was previously the lowest-cost yet usable smartphone in the world before, leaks suggest that Motorola’s moving toward another. The Moto C, as it’s tipped to be called, will come in multiple colors. What’s the big deal? Over the past several years, Motorola has gone through some big changes. They’ve been acquired by Google, sold by Google to Lenovo, and have made a big effort in revitalizing their place in the smartphone industry with several big moves. One was creating Moto X, a line of smartphones that presented the best of Google’s Android while allowing the user to custom-select their hardware features (like casing color and engraving). Another big move by Motorola – arguably their biggest in many years – was pushing hard on the budget smartphone market. To do this, they released the Moto G, a device that became their best selling smartphone ever. Several years later and, as you’ll see in our Moto G5 Plus Review, the Moto G line is still pretty excellent. Over time, though, the Moto G line stopped being low price leader and started to hit the midrange. With prices at $200 (and thereabouts, and upward), Moto G started to become something other than what it was born as. Motorola’s new lowest-price smartphone will be Moto C – so say the leaks. Where can I get one? Thus far there’s been no official confirmation from Motorola or Lenovo or Google or anyone that the images we’ve seen and details we’re presenting are legitimate. Instead we’re relying on anonymous sources supposedly familiar with the industry – and Motorola, specifically. As such, we do not know exactly when (or if) the Moto C will be officially released – though Weibo’s Ucanip seems pretty sure about it. General consensus seems to be that the Moto C could be released by Motorola in several regions starting in late April, 2017. If this is true, there’s a chance that it might not come to the United States until later on – maybe May. At that point, it’s unlikely the Moto C would be released with carriers – it’d be sold instead by Motorola online, unlocked and off-contract. What’s this mean for me? It could mean two things. First, if this all turns out to be some extremely elaborate hoax, it means someone wants a cheap smartphone and is willing to spend inordinate amounts of time to pressure Motorola to make it. Second, it could mean that Motorola is once again pushing the lowest price for a decent smartphone downward – that’s good news for everyone. Motorola Moto C • Display: 5-inch IPS LCD with 720 x 1280 pixel resolution (that’s 720p) • Operating System: Android 7.0 Nougat • Processor: MediaTek MT6737 / Unnamed Snapdragon • RAM: 1 or 2GB RAM • Camera: 8MP with 720p video and LED flash • Front-facing camera: 5MP with 720p video and LED flash • Internal Storage: 8 or 16GB with 128GB-capable microSD card slot for storage expansion • Other Features: Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, EDGE, Micro-USB 2.0, FM Radio, headphone jack, Proximity Sensor, Accelerometer, Compass, Ambient Light, G-Sensor Of note: Missing fingerprint scanner and NFC and USB is not USB-C. Also note that this device is expected to use the slightly older version of Bluetooth, and that dual-SIM card support is expected, all with GSM connectivity up to 4G LTE. ALSO NOTE: Cameras have also been tipped at 5MP and 2MP, which would be excruciatingly low-end – but it’s possible! If Motorola continues to push the borderline downward, other manufacturers will be forced – or will at least feel the pressure – to create more inexpensive devices, too. Above you’ll see a set of specifications for the Motorola Moto C. These specs come from anonymous sources and leaks which are not at all official, and could very well change between now and any sort of announcement Motorola makes.

Image: achinthamb/Shutterstock Google at war with US Department of Labor over pay gap by Jenny Darmody 1 hour ago1 Share Google is painting a very different picture to the one portrayed by the US Department of Labor with regard to the company’s gender pay gap. Last week, on Equal Pay Day, Google announced that it had closed the gender pay gap globally. Three days later, the Department of Labor (DoL) said it had evidence of monetary disparity between men and women in Google. The tech giant has responded to the DoL claims by releasing its pay methodology, which company officials describe as “blind” when it comes to gender. They can’t both be right. According to The Guardian, DoL regional director Janette Wipper said: “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce.” The comments were made during a hearing as part of a lawsuit, which was filed when Google failed to comply with a routine audit earlier this year. Google said it refused to turn over the request for privacy reasons, triggering the DoL to take the company to court in order to retrieve the information. Presented with DoL claims that discrimination against women in the company is “quite extreme”, Google has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. Google fights back Hiring Now Fidelity International: A truly unique proposition Be part of a globally successful team Help develop the future of sales and trading Life-changing career opportunities for you In a statement released on Google’s blog today, Eileen Naughton, vice-president of people operations, said: “Google conducts rigorous, annual analyses so that our pay practices remain aligned with our commitment to equal pay practices.” Naughton said the analysis used is extremely scientific, robust and blind to gender. It is explicitly outlined in the statement: first, an employee’s compensation is suggested based on experience, job level, job location and performance ratings. The employee’s manager can adjust these slightly, subject to sufficient reasoning and rationale. The compensation is then held up against other employees in the same categories to confirm there are no discrepancies between genders. “Our analysis gives us confidence that there is no gender pay gap at Google,” said Naughton. With both sides claiming to have strong evidentiary support, it now comes down to the specific data Google is measuring, compared to the DoL. This isn’t the first time that the DoL has challenged a tech company over discriminatory practices with female employees. In January of this year, it sued Oracle over alleged pay discrepancies based on gender and race.

No way could there be pay discrimination at Google, Google says. Image: justin sullivan/Getty Images By Emma Hinchliffe2017-04-11 15:10:29 UTC Google said it was "quite surprised" when the Department of Labor claimed last week that the tech giant fostered an extreme gender pay gap across its workforce.  And now it's telling us why. Google claims that its pay practices support salary equity to prevent pay gaps by gender and race.  To back up that assertion in its fight with the Department of Labor, Google Vice President for People Operations Eileen Naughton outlined Google's process of salary analysis in a blog post titled "Our focus on pay equity" published Tuesday morning.  According to Naughton's post, Google analyzed 52 job categories for salary discrimination last year. In practice, Google analysts — not managers — who didn't know the gender of employees suggested new compensation for the upcoming year based on an employee's role, level, location, and performance ratings. Managers could then adjust that amount slightly but weren't the ones to determine initial offers.  Then, the company looked at finalized salaries statistically to check for any differences in pay by gender that made it through that process.  Naughton wrote that the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs accused the company of not compensating women fairly without supporting data or methodology. Her blog post also said that the office is still seeking thousands more employee records, seeming to imply that the watchdog office couldn't have reached a conclusion yet.  "Our analysis gives us confidence that there is no gender pay gap at Google," Naughton wrote in her post.  Google has claimed it has reached equal pay before. Just last week, before the DOL's public allegations, Google promoted its salary equity on Equal Pay Day.  Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay.

By Emily Bary April 11, 2017 9:11 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large One analyst surveyed 30 local businesses, none of which planned to move any Yelp spending over to Google. Illustration: Bloomberg News Yelp still seems to be the destination for local advertisers, according to one analyst. After talking with a handful of businesses, Pacific Crest analyst Brad Erickson concluded that Yelp offers something Google and Facebook can’t. Businesses feel it’s the best way to reach visitors who are ready to make a decision about where to eat or get a haircut. Potential customers who look up places on Google, meanwhile, tend to have “lower intent.” None of the 30 businesses surveyed by the firm said that they were planning to move any of their Yelp budget over to Google.

Erickson set a price target of $43, 31% above current levels. Yelp is somewhat of a rarity among small- and medium-sized Internet companies these days, he says, in that it looks poised to grow in ways that could help its margins, a measure of profitability. Less than 10% of advertisers use the company’s self-serve option, which lets them manage their budgets themselves, but this choice might make sense for about a third of its ad base. Yelp incurs few costs with this program. In contrast, the company’s full-service option provides video assistance and offers “salesperson handholding,” according to Erickson. Big Picture: Local advertisers like that Yelp attracts visitors who are ready to make a decision about where to go.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Play carrier billing now available in 5 more countries By Ida Torres - April 11, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Ever since Google introduced carrier billing to the Google Play Store, more people have been able to buy apps and also in-app purchases since they don’t need a credit card and just charge it to their carrier. Now five more countries will be able to experience this as well, namely Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, Pakistan, Slovenia, and Vietnam. Additionally, Google has added some new carriers in the US (Boost) and Indonesia (Vodafone) so that even more people will be able to charge their store purchases to their bills. Direct carrier billing is pretty important for markets that only have credit card as a payment option. Instead of using that or in some cases, a Google Play gift card, you can buy the app or in-app purchase right then and there and just defer payment. The charges will be added to your bill and you pay for it together with your monthly carrier payments. For Boost Mobile users in the US, you will now be able to use carrier billing for your purchases and so will Vodafone users in Indonesia. But for the five aforementioned countries, it will be the first time that they will be able to do so. Expect mark-up fees for some of the charges, but it will still be worth it if you don’t have any other payment options anyway. Hopefully more countries will be added to this list to empower more people to get the apps that they want or need. And for those that already have carrier billing, hopefully they add more networks to the list as well.

Eileen Naughton, Google's Vice President of People Operations, said in a blog post on Tuesday that every employee's new compensation each year is based on role, job level, job location as well as current and recent performance ratings. "Our analysis gives us confidence that there is no gender pay gap at Google. In fact, we recently expanded the analysis to cover race in the U.S.," Naughton said. Google's response comes after Labor Department regional director Janette Wipper testified in a San Francisco court Friday that the pay disparities against women appear to be found "pretty much across the entire workforce" at the tech company. In January, the U.S. Department of Labor filed a lawsuit requiring Google to provide requested compensation data and documents for the company's Mountain View headquarters. Google said in the blog post that it suggests an amount for every employee's new compensation each year. This suggested amount is "blind" to gender, and the analysts who calculate the suggested amounts do not have access to employees' gender data, the company added. The calculated amount is then fed into Google's pay equity model, which then analyzes the compensation to employees in the same job categories to confirm that the adjusted amount shows no statistically significant differences between men's and women's compensation. Google noted that an employee's manager has limited discretion to adjust the suggested amount, providing they cite a legitimate adjustment rationale. Google said its "extremely scientific and robust" annual analysis relies on the same confidence interval that is used in medical testing. The company has made the methodology available to other businesses who want to test their own compensation practices for equal pay. Nevertheless, Google said it hopes to work with the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs or OFCCP to resolve the issue, and to help in its mission to improve equal pay across federal contractors. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Unhappy Campers: The 10 Most Miserable Nations on Earth Feeling Groovy: The 10 Countries With the Best Health Care The Ten Largest Economies In Africa Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories European Shares Seen Flat To Higher China Inflation Rises Slightly; Producer Price Inflation Moderates Asian Markets Mostly Lower Amid Risk Aversion FDA Approves 1st Drug For Tardive Dyskinesia, AGRX On Track, ITEK, AZRX On Watch Gainers & Losers Of Apr.11: WINT, GNCA, MESO, CYTX, ENDP...

In the midst of this noise, it is very easy to get lost with what you actually need to know about the update. This post will give you a quick overview of what the update entails, as well as the main things to check for on your site to prevent a loss in traffic. What is the Mobile-First Index? The mobile-first index is a change in the way Google is going to index content. Currently, Google looks at the desktop version of a site and then bases how it will rank the mobile site according to that information. Once this update rolls out, the opposite of that will happen. Google will begin looking at your mobile site and from that, will rank the desktop site. When will it be released? While we are still waiting for an official release date, we do know the update is in the pipeline and being tested. Whenever Google gives us further news on when the update will be released, they repeat the message that it is still ‘months’ away. From their comments, we can assume the release is going to be in the second half of 2017. Why is this happening? Nearly two years ago Google announced more searches occur on mobile than desktop. As mobile is now the predominant way for people to search on Google, it makes sense for them to ensure the experience on this device is as good as it can be. In lots of situations, sites provide a worse or thinned down user experience on the mobile device, that is not as good as the desktop site. This happens more on mobile sites where separate URLs are used or where dynamic serving is being used. What to check on your site Content Look at the mobile version of your site. Is the content from the desktop version visible/accessible? You should be providing a consistent experience for users no matter the device they access the site on. One of the things to consider is the actual content on the site. If you are currently removing or hiding content on your mobile site, think of ways in which you can have this content on both. You ideally want content to be accessible regardless of how the site is accessed. Make sure you also consider the best way to move this content over to the mobile site. You do not want to sacrifice your user experience just to meet this requirement. For example, do not put a content block with 300 words of content at the top of an ecommerce category page, pushing all your products way down the page. Consider moving the content lower down the page or partially hiding it with a ‘read more’ button or in an accordion. (I’m not a big advocate of read more buttons, but do whatever works best for your site!) Along with the actual content on the page, ensure your headings (H1s) and titles are not missing and are set as you want them to be. Page speed The speed of your site is an essential thing to consider to help improve usability, especially on mobile. Google already considers page speed when ranking a page, and this will be just as important when the mobile-first index is fully live. Personally, I feel it would make more sense if this ranking factor was taken into consideration more when the mobile-first index is live. Accessing a site can be a painful experience on a mobile device when not connected to Wi-Fi, and it would make sense for Google to prioritize this usability factor more. To check whether you need to action anything with this issue, test your site in Google’s PageSpeed Insights Tool. Alternatively, use my site speed tool of choice, GTmetrix. If any problems are shown, fix them! If your site is not loading in around three seconds, I recommend looking into the reasons behind this and seeing why your site is slow. GTmetrix has a great Waterfall feature that is incredibly useful when trying to see which requests are slowing down your site. Internal linking/site structure A well-known issue with sites that use either dynamic serving or separate URLs for their mobile site is that the internal linking is vastly different to the desktop site. This can cause some user experience issues for readers as they struggle to find content that can be easily discovered on the desktop version of the site. Similar difficulties are caused when Google crawls the mobile site. If your internal linking/information architecture on the mobile site does not closely replicate the desktop, this can cause internal link equity to be poorly distributed throughout the site, which will cause a drop in rankings.

Structured data In a lot of cases, structured data is removed from the mobile version of the site. Unfortunately, you are going to have to move all your structured data over to the mobile site, as Google will begin looking towards that for structured data. Use Google’s structured data testing tool on your mobile and desktop site to see if the structured data is the same across both devices. Which sites are currently at risk? Firebox While the Firebox site is responsive, currently it hides content on category pages with no way to access it once you visit the mobile device. This goes against what Google is recommending. Here is an example: New Look The New Look website suffers from similar issues to Firebox, except this time they are also removing internal linking along with content. See examples below: They not only remove content from the actual main body of the page, the internal linking from the main navigation has also been reduced on mobile so it only links to the parent categories. This is causing a large number of pages to be an increased number of clicks from the home page, which is less than ideal. See below: There are plenty of further examples across multiple sites. Unfortunately, as Google noted in their original blog post on the mobile index, sites tend to provide vastly different content on the mobile version of their site. While I believe that adjusting elements and the prominence of them for mobile users is something that makes sense, such as promoting search further and hiding elements in dropdowns/accordions, you need to ensure the experience is at least consistent. Avoid removing core parts of the page such as internal links and content. A prediction for the future Given what Google has already announced regarding the mobile index update, it is evident the main issue they are trying to tackle is poor usability of the mobile site. Over the past year, there have been multiple updates that target sites that are ad-heavy, with low-quality content. These updates include the core/Phantom updates as well as the recently released mobile interstitial update in January. Considering the smaller screen space on mobile, I imagine Google is only going to get more aggressive in penalizing ad heavy sites with intrusive interstitials. I expect that future core updates will be harsher on sites that ruin the mobile experience of the site with ads. If this is something that you do, update your sites so ads are less intrusive. It’s bad for your brand, users and traffic. There is a way to implement ads without ruining your site. To summarize The mobile index is going to be a significant change in the way Google ranks sites. To ensure you are not negatively impacted, make sure that your user experience is similar across both the mobile and desktop site. If you do not have a responsive site, make sure you check to see if you have any of the above issues. It may also be a good time to consider creating a responsive site to benefit from reduced maintenance. Any questions, feel free to comment below or tweet me at @SamUnderwoodUK.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU Graphics Industry News 2 Nvidia responds to Google TPU benchmarking comparison by Mark Tyson on 11 April 2017, 12:21 Tags: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadgat Add to My Vault: Last week Google decided to share some information about the utility and performance of its home-grown Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) accelerator chip. Google designed this AI accelerator after foreseeing difficulties in using off-the-shelf solutions from the likes of Intel and Nvidia. It developed the TPU remarkably quickly to cater for the boom in voice and image search, and translation services, and more. The TPU was in operation in 2015, just two or three years after development started. Nvidia Tesla K80 Nvidia likes to promote itself as a company at the cutting edge of AI, plus the associated data centre and deep learning technologies. So reading about Google's TPU benchmarks and comparisons in performance to contemporary older Nvidia accelerators like the Tesla K80 might have spoiled Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's morning coffee. Yesterday Jensen Huang wrote a response of sorts via the Nvidia Blog. In a post entitled 'AI drives the rise of accelerated computing in data centres', Huang agreed with Google's assertion that practical AI, for voice and image recognition, translation, and more on the internet today, requires accelerated computing. Accelerators power deep learning which helps create these AIs, and is also being used outside of web tech in areas such as diagnosing cancer and teaching autonomous cars to drive. Nvidia Tesla P40 Turning to the Google TPU benchmark results, Huang highlights the fact that while Nvidia's Kepler-generation GPU, architected in 2009, "helped awaken the world to the possibility of using GPU-accelerated computing in deep learning, it was never specifically optimized for that task". Since that time Nvidia has progressed though Maxwell, and now Pascal architectures implementing "many architecture advances specifically for deep learning". In headline performance terms the "Pascal-based Tesla P40 Inferencing Accelerator delivers 26x its (Kepler's) deep-learning inferencing performance, far outstripping Moore's law," says Nvidia CEO Huang. Google's TPU data said that its chip offered 13x the inferencing performance of the Tesla K80 - by simple maths that makes the Nvidia Tesla P40 is twice as fast as the Google TPU… Nvidia created a comparison table with more performance metrics included, as below: The 'NA' in the above table is there as the Google TPU doesn't run training tasks. We can see great progress in the change from the Kepler to Pascal Tesla accelerators. However Google's custom ASIC still gets its work done at about double the speed, in integer teraops, with remarkable power efficiency - a major consideration in its huge data centres. Nvidia watches rival firms' benchmark comparisons very closely for 'fairness', further evidence comes from back in August last year when it took Intel to task for comparing its new Xeon Phi coprocessor cards with much older Nvidia Tesla K20X (Kepler) accelerators.

The company said it conducts "rigorous analyses" that its pay practices are gender-blind and found "no gender pay gap" in 52 major job categories it analyzed last year. Google added that analysts who calculate suggested pay don't have access to employees' gender data. Google also said that beyond gender pay equity, the company recently expanded the analysis to cover race in the U.S. as well. The U.S. Department of Labor had accused Google of shortchanging women doing similar work to men, saying it found "systemic compensation disparities" across the company's workforce. Google responded in a blog post Tuesday that the department's assertion "came without any supporting data or methodology." The company said it had already produced hundreds of thousands of documents in response to 18 separate requests, and the government is seeking thousands more, including contact details of employees. The department had no comment, saying the case is ongoing. The difference between Google's and the Labor Department's claims might come down to how each side defines pay discrimination, Tim Worstall, a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute in London, wrote in a recent post for Forbes. "Google is using a strict definition of 'same job' to find no gender pay gap. The Department of Labor is using a looser definition of 'similar job' to find that there is one," he wrote. "Who you think is right here is entirely up to you but that's where the disagreement is." Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In explosive accusations last week, the US Labor Department alleged Google permits “systematic compensation disparities against women,” with officials citing data on pay gaps at the search giant they found to be “quite extreme.” In a Tuesday blog post, Google’s vice president of people operations, Eileen Naughton countered that the tech giant conducts “extremely scientific and robust” analyses of its pay data to make sure it’s calculating salaries fairly. “We were taken aback by this assertion, which comes without any supporting data or methodology,” Naughton said. Google’s pay analysts take into account a worker’s role, job level, job location and performance ratings, she said. The analysts don’t have access to an employee’s gender data, and the employee’s manager has limited ability to adjust pay levels. “In late 2016, we performed our most recent analysis across 52 different major job categories, and found no gender pay gap,” Naughton said, noting that the company recently expanded its analysis to cover race. In a Friday court hearing, US Labor Department Regional Director Janette Wipper said the agency had “compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.” On Tuesday, Naughton confirmed that the agency is “seeking thousands of employee records, including contact details of our employees, in addition to the hundreds of thousands of documents we’ve already produced in response to 18 different document requests.” Nevertheless, Labor Department officials complain that Google has been hiding the information they really need to assess the problem.

I use Google Maps every day and I didn't even know about some of these until Google pointed them out. I guess that's the very definition of hiding in plain view, right? Anyway, here are some Google Maps secrets that might help you get more out of the app, and you might not have known they were even there. SHARES Todd Haselton | @robotodd 16 Hours Ago Create Custom Lists Did you know you can create Lists of places in Google Maps, and then save them for later or share them with friends? I didn't. Just search for a place then tap "Save" and choose to add them to your favorite spots, or create a brand new custom list. In this example, I created a list of awesome spots to see during a visit to Manhattan. Todd Haselton | CNBC Save Maps Offline Ok, I admit I knew about this, but I think a lot of people still haven't discovered the feature. You can save maps offline for viewing and searching even when you don't have a wireless signal, like when you're in the subway or driving through the middle of the desert. Just tap the left menu button and select "offline areas" to begin. Todd Haselton | CNBC Reserve with Google This is another one I'd never heard about. Google teamed up with a bunch of fitness providers to allow customers to schedule appointments right in Google Maps, though you need to use the web-based version. It works with Appointy, Front Desk, Full Slate, GenBook, MyTime and MINDBODY to let you find a class wherever you are in the U.S., whether you're at home or out on the road. Todd Haselton | CNBC Share Location This is a fairly new feature that launched only a few weeks ago, though Google has offered similar services for a while. You can share your real-time location – maybe while driving home during a snowstorm, for example – so your friends and family know you get some safe. You'll set how long the location is shared for, and who gets to view, and you can turn it off manually at any time. Just tap the menu button and then tap "Share location" to get started. Add a quick stop for coffee If you're driving to work and decide you need just one more iced coffee before getting to the office, you can easily add a pit stop without messing with your original GPS route. Just tap search while driving and find a local point of interest, like a Dunkin' Donuts, and Maps will add the stop to your trip. Todd Haselton | CNBC more from Tech Guide

SAN FRANCISCO – Was former President Barack Obama's birth certificate faked so he could run for office? It depends on how you ask Google.  Popular Searches Toyota Motor Corp TM ▲ 106.40 +0.42 +0.40% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 73.43 +0.37 +0.51% Telstra Corp Ltd TLSYY ▲ 17.32 +0.21 +1.23% Yahoo! Inc YHOO ▼ 46.79 -0.42 -0.89% The search engine giant last week expanded a test fact-checking program worldwide in a bid to help stop the spread of misinformation after it faced criticism for returning fake and offensive information in its popular search queries.  USA TODAY tested the feature out, asking Google a range of questions previously proven false — and some known to be true.  The result: Whether an answer surfaced what Google calls a "fact-check snippet" depended on how you phrased the question and whether the topic had been fact-checked by an organization taking part in Google's program. The snippets aren't tags on specific stories but rather on search words or phrases that appear in the list of results.  Search "Obama Kenyan citizen" and a fact check snippet pops up from Snopes.com, detailing reasons why a purported Kenyan birth certificate for Obama was a fake.   Search "Obama birth certificate fake," however, and no snippet turns up. Instead, the first link is a story from WorldNetDaily, a site run by leading birther proponent Joseph Farah, which says that Obama's Hawaiian birth certificate was faked.  The responses highlight the difficulties the world's most popular search engine faces as it works to offer users more authoritative and credible information after being critiqued for returning fake and offensive information items in response to some queries. Google had been running a limited test fact check program in the United States and the United Kingdom for articles on news.google.com since October. The new roll-out applies to all searches worldwide — not just news — in all languages it supports. The inclusion of a fact-check topic won't affect the ranking of search results.  The information in the fact check tags comes from third-party fact-checking organizations. In the United States so far those include PolitiFact.org, FactCheck.org, Snopes.com, the Washington Post, the New York Times and GossipCop.com. Internationally there are between 50 and 100 groups offering tags, Google said. The fact checking doesn't just cover political stories, but a broader swathe, including science and health.  The search terms that trigger fact check snippets depend on whether a given topic has been the subject of a fact check and what words and phrases were tagged. While it's unclear if the results might sway those committed to a specific point of view, they give a sense of the power Google has to tailor search results for a specific purpose.  The Mountain View, Calif.-based search giant's move comes a month after Facebook began adding a "disputed" warning tag to some articles with no basis in fact. Thus far the fact check tags seem to be most often triggered by long-existing false stories. For example, a search in Google's main search box of the phrase "kidney theft" give a top return that links to a Snopes.com article debunking a popular, and false, Internet topic about unwary travelers being drugged and used as unwilling kidney donors by organ thieves.  Some political topics are also present. Searching on "national parks coal mining" give as its first return a snippet from Snopes titled "Did President Trump Open National Parks and Wildlife Refuges for Coal Mining?" and the label of "Mixed" as to its truth. President Trump did sign an executive order in March that overturned a temporary moratorium on the leasing of federal lands for coal mining, but Snopes noted that public lands had never been fully and permanently closed to such activity in the first place. The phrase "30 million undocumented immigrants" brings up Google fact-check snippets because during the presidential campaign, Trump made the claim that the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States could be much higher than the 11 million previously reported by the U.S. government. “It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million," Trump said in a speech in Phoenix in August. That number was actually pegged at 11.4 million by the federal government in 2012, a number corroborated by groups such as the non-partisan Pew Research Center. The system isn't partisan and any fact check organization that wants to can take part, as long as it abides by Google's terms of service for fact check snippets, Google says. They require that analysis "be transparent about sources and methods, with citations and references to primary sources." Each snippet also comes with a Feedback link for users to respond. Google has been under pressure, both internally and externally, to provide more authoritative and truthful results. In December after it emerged that a Holocaust-denying site was the first one that popped up when someone searched “Did the Holocaust happen?” the company changed its algorithm to “help surface more high quality, credible content on the web,” reported tech news site Search Engine Land. While such sites make up fewer than 1% of Google queries, the company clearly has begun to address the problem and has been putting a lot of resources into it, said Barry Schwartz, a news editor at Search Engine Land. “If someone’s searching for something specifically, even if it’s rumor and not true, Google wants to show them that authoritative sites believe it’s not factual,” Schwartz said.

The current IAS solution available to clients is MRC-accredited, and reports on eight separate brand risk categories — adult content, alcohol content, gambling content, hate speech, illegal downloads, illegal drugs, offensive language, and violence — to give advertisers a comprehensive understanding of their brand risk. Additional specifications are available to customize risk thresholds, as well as option for geo-compliance, keywords, and blacklists. „Our H2 2016 Media Quality Report show that brand risk continues to be a key area of concern for advertisers, especially as it pertains to politically charged, controversial, or offensive content. Content flagged for hate speech increased by 137% across U.S. display direct and for violence by 27% global video direct from H1 2016 alone,” said Scott Knoll, CEO of IAS. „Your brand is your reputation and Google is taking the right steps forward to address this industry issue. By partnering with independent, third parties like IAS, advertisers have additional assurance and more visibility into where their ads are running.” About Integral Ad Science Integral Ad Science (IAS) is a global technology and data company that builds verification, optimization, and analytics solutions to empower the advertising industry to effectively influence consumers everywhere, on every device.

Developed by Google’s DeepMind, the software in 2015 became the first computer Go program to beat a human professional. It made history again last year, when it pummeled Sedol. But despite fears that AI may diminish the ancient Chinese game, artificial intelligence has actually made human players stronger and more creative, according to DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis. “It’s humbling to see how pros and amateurs alike, who have pored over every detail of AlphaGo’s innovative gameplay, have actually learned new knowledge and strategies about perhaps the most studied and contemplated game in history,” he wrote in a blog post. Invented in China more than 2,500 years ago, and played by more than 40 million people worldwide, Go requires players to place black or white stones on a board in an effort to capture the opponent’s pieces or surround empty spaces to build territories. The deceivingly difficult game features more possible moves than there are atoms in the universe, eliminating traditional “brute force” AI methods that search for all conceivable sequences of moves. “AlphaGo’s play makes us feel free, that no move is impossible,” Go pro Zhou Ruiyang said in a video (above). “Now everyone is trying to play in a style that hasn’t been tried before.” New styles will be tested further at the “Future of Go Summit,” scheduled for May 23-27 in Wuzhen, China, where AlphaGo and top Chinese players are invited to “explore the mysteries of the game together.” A variety of formats include “Pair Go” (where two human competitors are paired with AlphaGo) and “Team Go” (where AlphaGo takes on a team of five people). The event highlight, meanwhile, is a classic one-on-one match of three games between the AI and the world’s No. 1 player, Ke Jie (pictured below). Go world champ Ke Jie (far right) with Google CEO Sundar Pichai (second from left) (DeepMind) Visitors can also learn more about AlphaGo and machine learning methods—also used to reduce energy use and for medical research—in a Google forum on the “Future of AI.” “We’re excited to see what insights this next round of games and discussion will bring, and the challenges this will help us solve together—both on and off the Go board,” Hassabis said.

We like this definition. New Android App Now Available for Free Download in Google Play Store Columbus, Ohio (PRWEB) April 11, 2017 Root, the first insurance company founded on the principle of fundamental fairness, announced a new app for Android devices today. The app is free and now available for download in the Google Play store. Support for Android was the most popular request from customers. Android is the world’s most prevalent smartphone operating system, controlling 86.2 percent of the market according to a report by Gartner analysts. Collectively, Root’s iOS and Android apps now cover the vast majority of the smartphone market. Current policyholders switching to Android can download the app with no lapse in coverage. Root is a mobile-only car insurance carrier which uses an app and artificial intelligence to determine driving habits—and give good drivers lower rates. To sign up for Root, users download the app and take it for a test drive before receiving a quote. New Android users will have access to all of Root’s popular perks, including the recently launched Tesla discount and the “Lyft on Us” program, which gives policyholders complimentary rides on three of the most dangerous driving days of the year. “Root should be available to as many good drivers as possible. Today marks a major milestone for the company. I’m really proud of our team for building a great app that that puts our service in the hands of more good drivers with Android devices,” said Alex Timm, CEO of Root Insurance. “Support for Android was a major goal of the company since inception. Next up, we’re eager to expand our footprint and take our mobile-first model to the rest of the nation.” Both of Root’s iOS and Android apps enable customers to personalize their quotes, purchase policies, and manage their plans—all on their phones. The Android user interface has been optimized for Android devices, and Root’s proprietary machine learning algorithms have been optimized for the respective motion and sensor technology of each device. Root currently supports 20 Android devices, including the most widely used phones manufactured by Samsung, Google, LG, Motorola and HTC. “We pride ourselves on being the first mobile-only insurance carrier, and that means reaching the widest population of mobile device holders possible,” said Dan Manges, Chief Technology Officer of Root. “We’re excited to open our door to Android users. We’ve worked hard to provide them a stellar user experience.” To join Root, drivers simply need to download the app and take a test drive, which takes approximately two to three weeks. Once complete, Root provides a quote (which heavily considers driving score) and allows customers to switch their policy—all through mobile phone. To become a Root policyholder and join other good drivers, sign up at: http://www.joinroot.com. About Root Root is the first insurance company founded on the principle of fundamental fairness. We create personalized products that give good drivers the protection they deserve. At Root we only insure good drivers, and that is why our rates are always fair. Unlike other insurance companies, we do not bundle good drivers with bad drivers. Instead, we use data science to find and reward good drivers with the best rates. Root is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. The company is an official carrier licensed by Ohio Department of Insurance, a member of the Ohio Guarantee Fund, and backed by the largest reinsurance company in the world.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google: We Update The Featured Snippet Selector Algorithm Often Google: We Update The Featured Snippet Selector Algorithm Often Apr 11, 2017 • 8:14 am | (3) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story You and I know that the featured snippets that come up in Google, espesially for the more generic queries, can rotate between different sites often. One day your site might be displayed for a featured snippet and then the next, it might not show up at all. That is just what we've learned to deal with when it comes to how featured snippets behave. Gary Illyes said the other day on Twitter that just like Google updates their algorithms all the time, they also update the "featured snippet selectors." I guess the featured snippet selectors are the algorithms that power which snippets are selected for being featured in Google. I guess Google adjusts which queries should show the snippets, how authoritative the site should be, what type of content should be selected and so forth. We do know that the sentence compression part of these featured snippets are somewhat powered by machine learning. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Now Google is opening up Classroom access to normal Google accounts. Starting today, G Suite for Education administrators will be able to manage who can join classrooms, with options for personal Google accounts, G Suite accounts, and even users from other G Suite domains. This change applies to both teachers and students. Google still recommends that schools sign up for G Suite for Education, but this should help make Google Classroom far more accessible. I can already use my Gmail account on the web app, but Android users might need today's Classroom app update.

Wilton Daniel Pinto I downloaded that app half an hour ago, but uninstalled coz it said it's not available for normal Gmail account​. And now this 😅 johnb847 Does this have any advantages compared to other collaboration tools? Is it useful for SMBs, project teams, etc? Ontari_do_not Is it possible for the personal account to make the classroom or is it just the student who can use the personal account in a classroom that is pre-made from an ed suite account classroom? Rusty Millabas Upon checking.... no . You can only join a class using a class code. Ontari_do_not Thank you JG Google still recommends that schools sign up for G Suite for Education I would LOVE my alma mater even more if it switched from being a Microsoft school to a Google school... Hook all of us alumni up with a G Suite for Ed account... Unlimited Drive space :) YES PLEASE... Lee I really wish I could use this resource for online tutoring sessions. Abbas Mustafa Bhaiji If someone can find programming, or anything computer related class codes that'd be great bogopogo You should probably change your headline, because it makes it sound like you can use Google Classroom as a teacher, with your personal Google account. That's how I read it, and based upon some of the comments, I'm not the only one. mainan anak Edukatif info yang sangat bermanfaat http://goo.gl/5dUrMs Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 142k 105k Latest Deals 2 [Deal Alert] Order an Amazon gift card valued at $25 or more through Alexa and get a $5 promo credit 2017/04/11 3:50pm PDTApr 11, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Verizon BlackBerry Priv for $259.99 on eBay 2017/04/11 12:35pm PDTApr 11, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Amazon's Gold Box deal has a SanDisk MicroSD 256GB for $120 and a 128GB dual USB-C/A drive for $39 2017/04/11 4:46am PDTApr 11, 2017 35 [Update: Added some more] Deal Alert: Here are some more temporarily free apps and games for your Sunday 2017/04/09 3:05pm PDTApr 9, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Gen LTE for $179.99 ($220 off) on eBay 2017/04/08 7:15pm PDTApr 8, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Which company has the track record or reputation for being secure? How do you know the value to expect? Out of the many clouds services available today, there are three leading options that come to mind: Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive. Each service in its own right is great at syncing, sharing and keeping files safe. We've decided to take a walk in the clouds to see how these giants stack up. Eyes to the sky, folks! For this comparison, we'll be looking at the individual, consumer versions of these three cloud storage solutions rather than their business or enterprise services. Free and tiered price plans Managing documents Syncing Sharing Final verdict Free and tiered price plans OneDrive OneDrive currently gives users 5GB of storage. Referrals will net you and your invited friend an additional 500MB each. This referral program limits you to a maximum of 10GB. After that, OneDrive has a few options available. You can increase your storage to 50GB for 1.99 per month. You can also go with two Office 365 packages that include OneDrive. Office 365 Personal is available for either $69.99 annually or $6.99 monthly, with 1TB of storage. This version allows you to install OneDrive on one Mac or PC, one tablet, and one mobile phone. Office 365 Home is $99.99 per year or $9.99 a month. It gives your group 1,000GB per person. Your installation limit then increases from one to five for computers, tablets, and mobile devices. Both Office 365 packages also come bundled with full versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. And they include features such as the ability to scan long documents and convert them to PDFs, and OneDrive mobile increased sharing limits. Google Drive Google Drive gives you 15GB for free. After that, you can upgrade to one of the many price plans. 100GB is available for $1.99 month, or you prepay annually and pay $19.99. 1TB will cost $9.99 monthly or $99.99 annually. The remaining plans are available on a month-to-month basis: 10TB for $99.99; 20TB for $199.99; and finally 30TB for $299.99. Keep in mind that your Google Drive storage space is shared with Gmail, which could potentially limit your overall storage capacity. As with OneDrive, Google Drive allows users to create and edit files, such as documents and spreadsheets. Before you download to your device, you will need to convert them to Google-friendly formats first. Dropbox For Dropbox, the free offering starts off at 2GB with the ability to gain more through referrals. For each person who signs up for Dropbox, you both receive an additional 500MB of storage, but it is capped at 16GB. Should you choose to upgrade to Dropbox Plus (formerly Dropbox Pro), your storage is then increased to 1TB (1,024GB). Additional features include remote device wipe, encrypted and expiring link access and view-only access. Dropbox Plus will cost you $9.99 monthly, or you can pay annually for $99.00, which works out to $8.25 per month. There is an option for extended version history for $39 that allows users to access previous versions of files, and deleted items, for up to one year without impacting your storage. The 1TB package tends to be the most popular. This is more than enough to help you back up your essential files. As we are looking at personal pricing rather than business, both OneDrive and Google Drive offer much more choice. That being said, the 1TB plan from OneDrive is cheaper than what Google Drive offers. In fact, for the same price of Google Drive's individual 1TB plan, OneDrive gives you 1TB per person, up to a total of 5TB, plus full versions of four essential Office programs. So OneDrive is by far the best option. It's not always about the size of your storage; it's also how you use it. To increase productivity surrounding your files, there needs to be a way to manage them. All three solutions grant users the ability to do more with their content, but how far you can go with it may vary. Managing documents In either Google Drive and OneDrive, you have the ability to create new files or edit existing file from the get-go. This makes it easy to update and compose from just about anywhere and at any time. OneDrive by default is fully integrated with Microsoft Office, which allows Windows users to use the same programs they're already comfortable with. This ease of use translates just as well between desktop, online and mobile versions. For Google Drive, you'll experience a sense of familiarity with Google's own lineup of office apps. At the surface, they are essentially the same as other word processing apps, though with Google Drive you can edit documents offline through Chrome. Google Drive also has a plugin that allows you to work with Microsoft Office instead. Dropbox sports integration with Microsoft Office, but it literally comes at a price. Unlike the other two contenders, which allow document editing and creation at any price plan, you have to be at least subscribed to Dropbox Plus for access to the feature. Paper from Dropbox allows for creation and editing of items, but only those found in Paper. You cannot transfer items from your Files to Paper or vice versa. Syncing Arguably, one of the most important features of any cloud service is the option to synchronize your files. Dropbox always syncs smaller files first, allowing for numerous files to be uploaded quickly, rather than waiting in the queue behind a much larger file. To further speed things along, the company also adopted incremental syncing into its functionality. With the Dropbox desktop app installed, all files found within the Dropbox folder will be automatically synced. From the desktop app, you can alter your upload and download speeds. Both Google Drive and OneDrive allow you to choose specific folders and subfolders rather than all items to sync. As with Dropbox, these folders must be located in the program's specific location. What makes OneDrive stand out is the fact that it's baked right into Windows 8 and Windows 10. Through Cortana, I can easily search for files found in OneDrive. While synchronization is fairly even across the board, it's the ease of searching without setup that sets OneDrive apart. On top of that, OneDrive helps to organize your files by type, making it much easier to find files quickly. Taking the time and location that photos are taken, OneDrive organizes them into galleries automatically. You can also access your files from "non-computing" devices, such as your Xbox One. Sharing OneDrive allows sharing of files or folders through direct email invites or a link that be shared through a variety of means. This can be done from OneDrive.com or directly within a program. So you could compose a Word document and choose to share it without leaving the file. When you share, you can opt to allow or deny editing capabilities. It's a Microsoft product, so it can manage Office files without limitation. This includes viewing and retrieving previous versions. You can also create a shared folder with another OneDrive user, allowing for easier access for offline work. If you want to share with Google Drive, it works the mostly same way, either through an email or a generated link. Items must be located in the My Drive folder by default. Google Drive offers advanced options for permissions, such as view-only or editing. If an item is mistakenly edited, you can always restore a previous version. Beyond editing, you can prevent copying, downloading and printing. Honestly, it makes for a slightly complicated sharing experience. Dropbox also promotes sharing a file or folder through a link or email. As a Dropbox Plus user, you can create a required password for or even set an expiry date on a link. The free Dropbox option also includes previous version retrieval but has a limit of 30 days. The previously mentioned extensive version history for $39 annually extends this to a year. Final verdict Each contender has proven to be a versatile and reliable cloud storage solution. But for those who use Windows 10, OneDrive is a clear winner here. Full integration and the "already included" experience it boasts with Windows and Office products makes it feel less like a standalone product and more a part of the entire Microsoft environment. It's nearly effortless to use, and it feels perfectly natural to save or share using OneDrive within Excel or PowerPoint. OneDrive.com is also, more visually appealing and fluid to manage. The Microsoft interface carries over smoothly into OneDrive.com, as you edit a document in Word online, and you don't feel as though you're in another program. From a frugality standpoint, OneDrive gives you a better value for the 1TB tier than Google Drive, and it also gives you more options on the free plan than Dropbox. Microsoft users, if you're searching for the right cloud service for you, look no further than your own backyard.

I have used all three services, I found that google drive is still the best. It is fast upload and download, little file restriction. Dropbox is slow and its suite is not attractive. Onedrive is good to integrate with office and windows, but its collaboration speed is much slower than google doc 0 13 hours ago Reply notrichyet I presume you mean that OneDrive via Office365 let's you install Office on one laptop, tablet and phone, not OneDrive...? 0 13 hours ago Reply AzurAccess I depend upon and really like OneDrive, but for my most important files I also use Dropbox simply because the sync engine is more robust without the need for my attention. OneDrive has a way of getting itself confused on syncing/uploading, which then means I have to figure out how to choose the right version to keep. This is something I can do, but I would never want to obligate, say, my wife to figuring out how to do this without accidentally over writing the latest version. Dropbox is bullet proof for this kind of thing, therefore safe for mere motels to use. 2 12 hours ago Reply Elias Georgiou No comparison here!! One drive is way better!!! 1 12 hours ago Reply Jozef jurcisin yes! I wish was same for windows phones! 0 11 hours ago Reply zr2s10 Your One Drive account should work on your Windows Phone just fine.  It should also give you access to full Office apps if you go with the 1TB or Family 5TB plans.  I'm considering it, since photos are backed up to One Drive on my Lumia 950, and I'm out of space. 0 8 hours ago Reply ErikasS Been a longtime Dropbox user, 99 dollars per year is worth it for me. Especially working with previous versions of a file is very good. I guess it all comes down to personal preference. 0 12 hours ago Reply Mike G For $99/yr, you get 1TB OneDrive storage plus full Office 365 suite for 5 users (total 5TB). If you can get everyone to pay their share, it brings the individual cost down to $20/yr each.

There are no restrictions, so you could theoretically get 4 other family members/friends and split the cost . At $20 a user for 1year of 1TB of storage +full updated versions of word, Excel,PP, Outlook, Access, Publisher,etc. It's a terrific deal Imo. 3 12 hours ago Reply ad47uk But that depends if you need all of that, for a lot of people something like Libre office will do the job and say a free dropbox account, or even a the free once drive account. the problem with something like office 365, is that if you lose your internet you are stuffed, also office 365 is flipping slow.     1 10 hours ago Reply jlwaters11 Not really true, since OneDrive is a folder on your computers you have all of your files at your disposal at any time. Only need the internet to sync to see on other devices. $20/ year (per user) for 1 TB of storage is clearly the best value considering you get all the office products. 1 9 hours ago Reply ad47uk good value if you need it, but do you really want to trust Micrsoft with your documents?   0 5 hours ago Reply kostas52 if you use Office go for OneDrive if you dont go for Google Drive simply 0 12 hours ago Reply Mike G I miss SugarSync. It was even better integrated into Windows file management than Microsoft's own OneDrive. Choosing folders to sync was available simply by right-clicking in Windows Explorer instead of having to go to a separate settings utility in the System Tray. 0 11 hours ago Reply WengWeng_21 OneDrive is great except for the countless of times I have to repair my OneDrive-business account because of sync issues. Also it doesn't allow me to type numbers in folder name, without syncing issues. Google Drive on the other hand just have a bad interface; Just try to upload properly name folders and see what they look like on your phone. Also Google have problems syncing multiple folders at once. 0 11 hours ago Reply ad47uk One of the  problems with one drive for me is that it is not supported on Linux, drop box is supported on linux, so i can sync between Linux, windows and my android devcices. The other problem with one drive is that the only way to sync is to change from a local account to a MS account., the other thing is I would not trust Ms with any of my data. i am not a fan of cloud storage anyway, so all I have in my drop box are two files and they are encrypted and even if someone got hold of them and managed to decrypted them they would find nothing of interest/   0 11 hours ago Reply RHoudek OneDrive is awesome, but i'm still pretty pissed that they removed the legacy storage bonus. I've been a Windows Phone user since 7.1 and while i don't expect the moon, they should have let me keep 15Gb, it really doesn't cost them anything to keep a long time user happy and not have to start re-thinking storage solutions now that i have to trim my content.

Dropbox is also universal to everyone and I like it. Anyway, I use OneDrive for a lot of years and I have 30gb of free storage. I prefer it because it's available everywhere, I get more free storage, it's built in my favourite PC and Mobile OS and it's super smooth and reliable. 0 10 hours ago Reply Dave47 I'm OK with OneDrive. I'll be more OK with it when they bring back Placeholders or equiv.

However, DropBox, even the free version, supports DEPOSIT access, which I need. That is, I can send a link to a folder to a bunch of people and whether they have a DropBox account or not, they can drop files for my review into the DropBox folder through their browser. They can't see what anyone else has put in the folder. There is no equivalent in OneDrive. I have requested OneDrive add this through the Feedback Hub, but so for no luck. I suspect MS wants to require all users have an account so they can increase their total userbase. Possibly good business, but at least for this feature, unfortunately, it pushes me to use DropBox. If OneDrive included this, I could drop everything else and just use OneDrive. 0 9 hours ago Reply sdreamer Just. Need.

Now though I have been keeping my photos in VK a Russian Facebook thing. There I can keep an unlimited amount of photos.

Enpass with OneDrive sync stopped working after a couple of days to weeks. I switched to Dropbox for this and never had an issue again.

All you have to do is say “OK Google, add dog food to my shopping list” and it’s automatically added to a list in Google Keep. That functionality isn’t going anywhere, but the list has a new home. Google has moved the Assistant shopping list from Keep to Google Express. If you’re unfamiliar with Express, it’s an online market that connects to popular stores. Now that the shopping list is in Express, you can purchase items from the service easily. That is if you use the Express service, to begin with. Otherwise, Express is just another app to install. If you don’t have the Express app, the list is opened in the web browser. Also, since Express doesn’t have a Wear app, you can no longer check things off from your watch. The move makes sense on Google’s end, they want people to use Express, but it’s not great for people who don’t use the service. What do you think?

Government data shows that taxes collected from foreign enterprises here settled at about 5.27 trillion won ($4.6 billion) in 2015, down 35.1 percent from 8.12 trillion won in 2012, despite the massive profits they generated in Korea. Tax authorities have been urged to tighten monitoring on foreign companies and their tax-paying practices to uncover the reason for the decrease. Against this backdrop, the NTS reportedly slapped a back tax of over 310 billion won on Oracle Korea. Expectations are other global enterprises such as Google, Apple and Cisco could be the next targets of the National Tax Service (NTS). "The NTS has been closely looking into multinational companies and their subsidiaries in Korea over their taxpaying and transferring of gains," a tax policy expert said. "There are multiple loopholes in Korea's laws on foreign firms and their taxation, which some companies seemingly exploited to dodge taxes," an industry source said. "Taking Oracle's case as an opportunity, the authority should strengthen monitoring of possible illegalities for the sake of taxation justice." With regard to Oracle Korea, the tax authority claimed the company sidestepped corporate taxes by shifting over 2 trillion won of gains it has generated in the Korean market between 2008 and 2014 to a tax haven in Ireland. Protesting the NTS, Oracle Korea filed a suit with the Seoul Administrative Court this February, calling for the cancellation of the measure. Besides Oracle, many other global enterprises such as Google, Apple and Cisco have been accused of avoiding or shrinking taxes in controversial fashions. Many multinational companies headquartered in the United States are basically subjected to heavy U.S. corporate taxes reaching 35 percent. For this reason, some of them have chosen to save the taxes by transferring the profit rights to a subsidiary in one of many tax havens such as Ireland, Bermuda and the Virgin Islands. According to the Korea Mobile Internet Business Association, Google gained 4.5 trillion won in Korea last year by operating Google Play, the mobile application market for Android devices. The association also expects Google Play will generate more than 5 trillion won of revenue this year. Google has aggregated the profits in its Google Play business here to those made in other countries, thus paying less in taxes here. As a limited liability company Google Korea thus is not obligated to share information about its earnings and taxpaying. "Google follows the laws and pays all applicable taxes in Korea. The Korean government recently completed an audit of Google Korea and found that the company is in compliance," Google Korea said. Cisco, which is the dominant provider of network equipment in Korea, has made its smaller local distribution partners directly make deals with its U.S. headquarters or suppliers in other countries. This way, the company registers its sales here to a branch in a country with a low tax rate, according to industry sources. Globally, such methods have been called the "base erosion and profit shifting" and tax authorities around the globe have long discussed an effective way of preventing this practice. yoonsw@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter Is US pre-emptive strike on N.

Yesterday GOOG: 823.35 -1.38 Google’s new ‘Similar items’ feature in Image Search uses machine learning to see products Edoardo Maggio - Apr. 11th 2017 5:15 am PT @northead Android Google Google Search View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Have you ever been looking at images on Google Images, notice something interesting (like an object within a specific photo), and wish you could dive deeper and get to know what exactly that object is? Well, it looks like the folks over at Mountain View did, and as a result they’re rolling out a new feature, “Similar items”, within Google Image Search on both the mobile web as well as Android‘s Google app… It works pretty much as you would expect, currently encompassing just fashion and lifestyle (think sunglasses, bags or shoes — but more will roll out in the coming months). If you are looking at, say, results for “designer handbags”, and your eye is caught by a particular photo, Google’s machine vision can now pick out the items in that photo and offer up easy shopping links. As mentioned, the “Similar items” feature currently surfaces in mobile search after tapping on a photo of interest. The feature will not only find what the objects in the image are (so, for instance, brand and model), but also their price and availability, two of the “top requests” from users, according to Google. As for people looking to take advantage of this new functionality, Google asks you to “make sure to add and maintain schema.org product metadata on your pages. The schema.org/Product markup helps Google find product offerings on the web and give users an at-a-glance summary of product info.” More specifically, to ensure eligibility: Ensure that the product offerings on your pages have schema.org product markup, including an image reference. Products with name, image, price & currency, and availability meta-data on their host page are eligible for Similar items Test your pages with Google’s Structured Data Testing Tool to verify that the product markup is formatted correctly See your images on image search by issuing the query “site:yourdomain.com.” For results with valid product markup, you may see product information appear once you tap on the images from your site. It can take up to a week for Googlebot to recrawl your website. Edoardo Maggio @northead Italian.

Google now shows 'Similar Items' shopping links on select image searches Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/10 11:56am PDTApr 10, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 26 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares74 Google News If you need to find an image of something, you're probably going to use Google image search. This is simply the nature of the internet right now. You might start noticing a new block of images showing up in your results going forward, though. Google has rolled out a "Similar Items" feature. These images are essentially shopping links for items that are similar to the ones in the image result. This feature uses machine vision to identify products in images as you open them in search results. Similar Items then kicks in to display shopping results for, well... similar items. The images appear as a carousel with price tags and the site where they are items are available. You could probably consider these ads, but Google says finding price and availability information in image search was a requested feature by users. It works right now with items like handbags, sunglasses, and shoes. It will roll out in the coming months to home and garden items, too. Similar Items appear on the web and in the Google app search interface on Android. Retailers that want to make sure their content appears in Similar Items need to include the proper metadata like name, price, image, and currency.

Gary Eastwood (CIO (US)) 11 April, 2017 22:12 - - - - print email Comments If there is a reason for why Amazon has been thrashing its competitors in the home assistant market, it is because Google and Apple thought there was no need for such a device like the Amazon Echo. What is the point of a home fixture with an intelligent assistant like Amazon Alexa when smartphones exist? The fact that an estimated 8 million people own an Echo as of 2017 shows that yes, such a device very much serves a purpose. And now instead of facing competition from Google and Apple in the home assistant market, Amazon seeks to strike back by integrating Alexa with phones. As CNET reports, Huawei Mate 9 owners “will get it first in an over-the-air update”, and it is available for iPhone users as well. Other Android users will eventually be able to install Alexa over their phones through the Google Play Store. But while Amazon so far has been looked like an unstoppable juggernaut everywhere it goes, working with smartphones is one area that will be a major challenge. While Amazon can seamlessly integrate Alexa with its own technology in the Echo, integrating it with a phone made by a different company presents challenges. Unfortunately, the Alexa app is not the same as having an Echo in your pocket, though it offers plenty of useful features. Missing key features A key reason why the Echo works so well is because it is always listening, ready to jump and answer a spoken question from across the room. As Engadget points out, Amazon succeeded in getting the Echo understand human voice commands by working with third parties and only focusing on American English. Amazon thus solved a problem which other virtual assistants still struggle with.  However, Alexa pretty much loses this vocal and ease of use advantage on the smartphone. While Android and iPhone users can use Assistant and Siri pretty much instantly, Alexa users have to tap on the Huawei Alexa app first. You have to tap again every time the phone goes to sleep, meaning that you may have to tap every 30 seconds or so to keep the conversation going. And while Huawei’s microphones are adequate, they do not compare with the Echo. Still, you eventually open up Alexa on your phone and it is pretty much Alexa. It can answer questions, play news broadcasts, give you weird jokes, and so on. But because Alexa is an app and not an integral part of the phone software like Siri is, its potential to interact with the rest of the phone is limited. For example, Alexa cannot tell you your location because it is not hooked to your phone’s GPS, and thus cannot hail a cab or give you directions from where you are. Alexa also cannot perform other critical things such as setting an appointment or an alarm. Siri and Google Assistant can perform these vital functions on their phones. The importance of skills and shopping Everything listed above may give the impression that the Alexa on a phone is just a pale imitator of Assistant and Siri. But Amazon has two important traits which show what Amazon wants Alexa to be. The first important trait is Amazon Skills, of which there are now over 10,000 according to PC Magazine. Alexa may not be able to perform certain critical functions on a phone, but it has a wider variety ranging from reading the news to playing games or 20 Questions to coming up with creative insults. An Apple user could thus use Siri to hail a ride, and then use Alexa to pass the time while in the cab. The second is shopping. You do need a separate app from Huawei Alexa or a backlit keyboard laptop, in order to shop on Amazon, but you can order from Amazon Prime using the Alexa voice app. Amazon’s primary goal with Alexa is to essentially turn it into the shopping app of choice for everyone. By putting Alexa in users’ pockets as well as their homes, Amazon will spread Alexa’s appeal among those who do not own an Echo. Room for improvement Amazon Alexa on the phone has plenty of interesting features, and the fact that Amazon is moving in on its competitors’ turf at all is a major victory. But Alexa on a phone does not possess the utility as it does with the Echo, and it is hard to see why people who already use Siri or Assistant will switch. But there are plenty of people who are familiar using Amazon Echo, and they may well stick with Alexa out of familiarity and fondness for its wide variety of skills. A more likely scenario is that instead of competition, Alexa will complement Siri and Assistant, letting users perform a wider variety of functions. This represents a step forward in popularizing virtual assistants, but Alexa has work to do in integrating themselves within phones and becoming the assistant of choice.

MSPoweruser Review Windows 10 Creators Update Laying the groundwork for Microsoft's ambitious future by Mehedi Hassan@mehedih_ MSPU Navigate Video Paint 3d Mixed Reality Gaming Edge Cortana Desktop Security OOBE Store Others Conclusion Windows 10, dubbed by Microsoft as the last version of Windows, has evolved meaningfully over the years since its first release in July 2015. Microsoft has released three feature updates for Windows 10 in the last 2 years and is going to start rolling out the new Windows 10 Creators Update (version 1703) to millions of PCs all around the world today — taking the OS one step further. When Microsoft introduced the Creators Update, the company mostly focused its presentation of features towards people who create things with their Windows 10 device. The Creators Update, however, brings something for almost everyone. If you are a developer, there’s something for you in the Creators Update. If you are a gamer, there’s something for you too. If you just use your Windows 10 device for web browsing and entertainment, the Creators Update has something even for you too. The Creators Update is supposed to be a minor upgrade to Windows 10 when compared to last year’s Anniversary Update, but there’s still a considerable number of features in the update just like most of the previous Windows 10 feature upgrades. In this review, we are going to give you a closer look at some of the biggest new features in Windows 10, ranging from a new Paint app, and even the new Share icon. Video Hands-on Paint 3D 3D is the main focus for Microsoft in the Windows 10 Creators Update. The company is adding two new apps to Windows 10 that will allow users to create 3D content, one of which is the new Paint 3D app. The Paint 3D app lets you create 3D objects and make something truly unique. You can create 3D objects using Paint 3D, and share them wherever you like. For instance, you can literally create a 3D dog, cat, or even a fish in the Paint 3D app. You can then change the color of the object, or add different stickers to it. There’s also an option that lets you create 3D text objects, and the position of the objects in the 3D environment can be changed using a very intuitive UI from within the Paint 3D app. Oh, there is a VERY neat feature that lets you see your creation in full 3D right in the app, too. Paint 3D is really cool – if you know how to create awesome things, that is. But if you are trying to create something with your mouse, you will have a hard time. Paint 3D is mostly for devices with new Windows technologies, such as the Surface with its pen and Samsung’s Galaxy Book with its own corresponding stylus. If you don’t have a Surface Pen or a similar stylus, you will have a tough time creating 3D content with your mouse and keyboard on Paint 3D. Overall, Microsoft’s Paint 3D is a lovely app with a stylish design, but the lack of keyboard and mouse functionality will have most turning to the old-fashioned Windows Paint app. But what’s so great about Paint 3D is Microsoft’s Remix3D platform. Remix3D is basically a platform where users can share their 3D creation. If you find something interesting in Remix3D, you can “remix” it and add it to your own 3D project. For instance, the image you see above isn’t my own creation – I honestly couldn’t draw something good with my mouse. Instead, it’s a 3D project made by combining other people’s work from Remix3D. Remix3D is literally the backbone of Paint 3D, and it is what makes creating 3D content with Paint 3D special. Paint 3D is not for the masses However, the unfortunate thing for most people though is that Paint 3D just does not work well on a desktop or a classic Windows 10 PC. Creating things with Paint 3D can be really fun if you have one of the modern Windows 10 devices that include a stylus or a touch display. You see, that’s the real problem with Paint 3D: it’s not for the masses. This will likely change over the next couple of years as more people start buying the new Windows 10 devices but for now, it probably won’t grab a lot of people’s attention. Microsoft thankfully isn’t forgetting about the majority of its customers and you will continue to be able to use the good old Paint app on your Windows 10 device after installing the Creators Update. The above 3D object was made with Microsoft’s “Lanscape with Waterfall“, “Seagull with headphones” and “Narwhal“, NinjaPigeon007’s “ChimpBot“, and Alkem’s “Mike” creations from Remix3D. Mixed Reality Mixed Reality is a big part of the Windows 10 Creators Update. This feature is perhaps one of the biggest new additions to Windows 10 that’s coming with the Creators Update, but you likely won’t be able to try it out just yet. The new Mixed Reality experience in Windows 10, which Microsoft is simply calling the “Mixed Reality Portal” allows users to experience and use Universal Windows Platform experience in a mixed reality environment via the forthcoming head-mounted displays (aka Virtual Reality headsets). The Mixed Reality Portal essentially allows users to use and experience UWP applications and games in a holographic environment, similar to the Microsoft HoloLens. Instead of the HoloLens, you will have to use the upcoming HMDs from Microsoft’s OEM partners to use the Mixed Reality Portal. OEMs like Dell and Lenovo are building new HMDs for Windows Mixed Reality, and you will be able to use those for the new Mixed Reality Portal in Windows 10. We were able to try out a simulator of the Mixed Reality Portal in Windows 10 that provided us with a pretty good idea of how it works. When you enter the mixed reality environment, you will be greeted with a holographic start menu from where you can open UWP apps like the Windows Store, Microsoft Edge or Movies & TV. The simulated Mixed Reality environment even has a virtual theater where you can put apps like Movies & TV and watch a movie that you bought from the Windows Store. Windows Mixed Reality requires a lot of work It’s neat to be able to use UWP apps in a mixed reality environment, but it isn’t really that useful currently. It’s a “fun” experience, though. However, the simulated environment also had its own issues – for instance, the trees and the house itself in the simulated environment were astonishingly low in quality. The sea water was completely still, and trees weren’t moving at all. I know I am nitpicking here but for a Mixed “Reality” environment, these are the basic things you would hope Microsoft to incorporate, but that, unfortunately, is not the case here. UWP apps were also pretty slow in the Mixed Reality environment, and interaction with keyboard/mouse and the Xbox One controller simply isn’t intuitive. For instance, when you open an app like Movies & TV app, you can no longer control your point-of-view and move around the mixed reality as the controller is focused on the app itself which is a bit irritating. It is possible these issues only occur in the simulated environment, and we are really hoping things are better on the Mixed Reality HMDs that are coming out later this year. Mixed Reality clearly isn’t ready for prime time in the Windows 10 Creators Update, but we will likely get to see major improvements to the feature with the upcoming Windows 10 “Redstone 3” upgrade that’s coming later this year. We’ll have a closer look at the Mixed Reality environment when we get our hands on the new HMDs, and we’re hoping these issues won’t appear in the “real” thing. So, keep an eye on MSPU for more on Windows Mixed Reality. Microsoft is betting big on Mixed Reality Mixed Reality is going to be a huge player in the future for Microsoft and Windows. Mixed reality is expected to be the future of computing, and Microsoft’s early work is going to significantly help the company in the future. It is quite incomplete at the moment, but Microsoft has shown us in the past that it is capable of making things radically improved with future updates. The software giant is betting big on Mixed Reality, but whether Mixed Reality will actually take off remains to be seen. I personally don’t think we will be using Mixed Reality devices in real-life anytime soon, and it will likely end up being a product that serves a niche market for Microsoft. For now, we’ll just have to wait and see where mixed reality goes. Gaming Gaming is also a huge part of the Windows 10 Creators Update which isn’t surprising to see as Microsoft has been focusing heavily on gaming in Windows 10 since the start. The company is still hard at work pushing the Xbox Play Anywhere program, and it’s introducing two new features to Windows 10 which play major roles in closing the gap between Windows 10 PCs and the Xbox One. Firstly, let’s talk about the new Game Broadcasting feature. Microsoft is adding a built-in game streaming feature into Windows 10 with the Creators Update that lets you stream any game you want without needing to install any extra software. The new Game Broadcasting feature is powered by Beam, an interactive broadcasting platform which Microsoft acquired last year. Built-in game streaming is really cool…when it works Streaming a game is simple – all you have to do is open up the Game Bar (Win + G) when you are in a game, hit the broadcast button and it will let you start broadcasting the game right from there. You can also stream your webcam along with the game itself, and disable things like microphone recording and webcam preview on the stream if you want. Once you start streaming, you can enable/disable any of these settings and read the chat right from a tiny preview that shows up over the game you are playing. The streaming quality is fairly good in Windows 10, and there’s barely any delay in the stream which is literally the best thing about Beam. What is worrying, however, is that Game Broadcasting is like a bumpy ride on the countryside. In our case, we had to restart our PC twice (!) to get Game Broadcasting working and from time to time you may get bizarre issues like “The game you are trying to broadcast does not support game recording”. Furthermore, the Game Broadcasting dialog closes by itself when you click outside of the dialog to work on something else during the initial stream setup which is going to be annoying if you have a multi-monitor setup. Additionally, you can’t reply directly to comments from the Game Broadcasting preview now but that’s something we hope Microsoft will add in the future. The second feature that’s coming to Windows 10 is a new Game Mode for gamers with PCs that aren’t super powerful. As the name indicates, Game Mode allows you to get a faster gaming experience as Windows 10 will allocate your PC’s memory and GPU resources to the game itself when Game Mode is enabled – rather than prioritizing other apps that are opened in the background. To be exact, when Game Mode is enabled, games will be able to use 80% of the cores on your PC while the other 20% will be utilized by other parts of the system. According to Microsoft, Game Mode can offer up to 5% improvement in the framerate on games. As a result, your games get the main “focus” of your PC’s resources and that results in a slightly improved performance. The improvements aren’t anything significant, yet they are still quite noteworthy. In our testing, we didn’t see a huge improvement for games like Forza Horizon 3 and Halo Wars 2. But if you have a PC that just about supports a game and it doesn’t have powerful hardware, you may see noticeable improvements for intensive games like Battlefield 1 or Gears of War 4 which require more resources. And that is what’s so good about the new Game Mode – it isn’t restricted to Windows Store games only. If you download a game from Steam or even EA’s Origin, the Game Mode will still support those games which is laudable, as a lot of game publishers aren’t really jumping on the Windows Store just yet. Gaming having a dedicated page on the Settings app in Windows 10 should give you a good idea of how big the update is for gamers. As I stated earlier in the review, the Windows 10 Creators Update isn’t only for creators – there’s a lot for gamers, too. Gaming on Windows 10 is getting better and better with every update, but Microsoft will have to polish out the Game Broadcasting feature as soon as possible because at the moment the initial setup isn’t a pleasant experience. Microsoft Edge Microsoft Edge is where Microsoft added a whole lot of things with the Creators Update. From the browser’s rendering engine to the browser itself it has picked up many new features that will make using Edge a much more pleasant experience for users. Firstly, Edge now supports a full-featured book reading experience. Microsoft is adding support for EPUB files to Edge with the Creators Update, and that ties in nicely with the new Book store on the Windows Store. Microsoft Edge and Windows Store works together to offer this native book reading experience – you can buy a book from the Windows Store, and read it on Microsoft Edge without needing to install any other extra tools. Microsoft Edge has a powerful new book reading experience built-in The book reading experience in Edge includes the basics – for example, you can see the Table of contents on a book with a single click of a button. There’s also a neat search function that lets you search for specific terms and even a virtual bookmark feature that will let you bookmark certain parts of a book. The book reading experience is however actually pretty powerful – there’s a Read Aloud feature that will automatically read a book aloud, and you can also customize the look of the book reading experience. Microsoft lets you change the theme of the experience, and you can also play around with the font settings. Neat, right? Managing a bunch of tabs on Edge is a lot more easier now Moving on from the new book reading experience, let’s talk about the improved Tabs in Edge. Microsoft is introducing two new tab management features to Edge with the Creators Update that the company claims will help you deal with all the tabs you have opened. Firstly, there’s a new Set Tabs Aside feature that lets you set the currently opened tabs aside – so that you can get back to at a later point. With this feature, you can quickly save a group of tabs to browse later and it’s a pretty nice addition that will be useful when you are researching something using Edge. And lastly, there’s a new Tab Preview feature which basically gives you a live preview of all the opened tabs when you hit the expand button. Both of these new features are nice additions to the browser, but I wish there was a shortcut which would let you quickly show tab previews. There are a lot of new additions to Edge with the Creators Update – for example, the Import feature has been improved, you can now run a downloaded file without requiring to save it, the Web Notes feature now utilizes the Windows Ink APIs, there’s support for WebVR, Web Payments and you can also now open an incognito window right from the jumplist in the taskbar. All of these are some really nice new features for Edge, but the new book reading experience is really the biggest new addition. Whether users will actually read books on their PC or tablet remains to be seen, but at this point you can’t really get a Windows 10 tablet that would offer a good book reading experience like Amazon’s Kindle. Support for WebVR and Web Payments are also two noteworthy new additions to Edge, along with all the other minor new additions and enhancements for the rendering engine of the browser. But again, Web Payments and WebVR are quite far from being mainstream – and don’t hope to be able to use Web Payments on your next Amazon purchase anytime soon. Microsoft Edge is still lagging behind Google Chrome With the Windows 10 Creators Update, Microsoft Edge continues to evolve – but users still need to install a whole OS upgrade to get simple new features on the browser which is really disappointing to see. I mean, you need to install a new OS upgrade to get features like Set Tabs Aside which could have been added with a simple app update for Edge. But that’s not the case at this point, and that’s causing Edge to lag behind some of the big boys in the industry like Google Chrome. Google releases updates for Chrome almost every month, adding new features and improvements to the browser – Microsoft, in contrast, only released two major upgrades to Microsoft Edge last year. And for a new browser like Microsoft Edge, this is something it simply can’t afford to do anymore as it’s still missing a lot of features when compared to Google Chrome — nearly 3 years after it was initially introduced. As I have recently written, Microsoft needs to bring Microsoft Edge to the Windows Store for the browser to succeed. Cortana Cortana is getting a lot more powerful with the Creators Update. OK, it’s not a massive upgrade – but the new additions are quite important. The major new feature in the Creators Update for Cortana is the new Pick Up Where You Left Off feature. This feature is mainly for users with multiple Windows 10 devices – what it essentially does is sync apps between your Windows 10 devices. So, for example, if you are reading an article on your Windows 10 laptop, Microsoft Edge but you want to continue reading it on your PC – you can simply turn on your PC, and open the exact same article by opening Cortana. Cortana’s Pick Up Where You Left Off has a lot of potential Even if you don’t own multiple devices, you can still take advantage of this feature as Cortana will keep track of all the apps you frequently opened recently. For instance, if you use Photoshop a lot, Cortana will have a quick shortcut to the app on its Pick Up Where You Left Off section which is what I call “seamless”. And if you use apps like Microsoft Word or any of the other Office 365 apps, you’ll see quick shortcuts to your recent files and documents. The feature isn’t completely flawless, though – sometimes when you click on a document, it opens up Office Online even if you have the Office apps installed on your PC which is a pretty annoying issue at the moment but something which Microsoft should be able to fix with a server-side update. But one of my biggest gripes with Pick Up Where You Left Off is the fact that it’s only locked to users in the United States. In addition to Pick Up Where You Left Off, there are a couple of other enhancements to Cortana. For instance, the personal assistant can now shut down, restart, or lock your device. It can also change the volume of your device, and “intelligently” detect the music app you intend to use by looking at your previous habits. There’s also a new idle mode in Cortana that will automatically enable a new full-screen UI that makes it easier to use Cortana with your voice when you are slightly away from your PC. This feature automatically gets activated when your PC is idle for several minutes, and when you say, “Hey Cortana”, it will open in a full-screen UI that’s optimized for long-distance reading – similar to how Cortana already works in the lock screen. The enhancements coming to Cortana are rather important for Windows 10 – they aren’t anything groundbreaking, but if you frequently use the personal assistant on your Windows 10 PC, you are going to like the Creators Update quite a lot. The desktop experience Microsoft made a lot of improvements to the actual desktop experience in Windows 10 with the Creators Update, this includes things like the Start Menu, the Action Center, the Settings app, and more. These changes are not anything game changing, yet they are significant when it comes to improving the day-to-day experience of using a Windows 10 PC. You can finally choose a custom accent color in Windows 10 Firstly, let’s talk about the new and improved customization features. You can FINALLY have a custom accent color for Windows 10. For the past few years, users were limited to using the preset colors that came with Windows 10 – the range of available colors were pretty decent, but getting the perfect accent color for your PC was still difficult. But now with the Creators Update, you can create your own accent color and use it on your device. Microsoft has also added a neat color picker for the custom accent color feature, where you can essentially choose a color you like. If you are an advanced user, you can simply enter a hex color code or play around with the RGB/HSV values, too. This new customization feature takes Windows 10 a step further in terms of personalization. It is not a huge feature by any means, but it is something I and a lot of other users have been waiting for. Being able to choose any color to use on your device is really neat, and the color picker makes it a lot easier to pick the exact color you want. Moving on to the Start Menu in Windows 10 — there’s a small new customization feature here, too. Don’t fret though, there isn’t any major overhaul happening. Microsoft is, instead, adding a couple of new features to the Start Menu to make it somewhat better. Firstly, you can now create folders of tiles on the Start Menu. This feature has been available on Windows Phone for a while now, but it’s now on PCs too and what this basically allows you to do is create a folder of live tiles on the Start Menu. Clicking on the folder will expand it and show all the tiles inside it, and you can customize the placements of the tile within the folder by dragging-and-dropping them. Another neat addition to the Start Menu is the ability to hide the All Apps list on the side. If you are like me and use Cortana/Search to open apps rather than using the All Apps list to find and open apps, you might like this feature as it completely removes the All Apps list from the Start Menu. As a result, you only get to see the app tiles on the Start Menu which makes it look a lot cleaner. Microsoft is also making some improvements to the Settings as per usual. The company is still far from removing the classic Control Panel, but with some of the previous Windows 10 updates it is modernizing more settings in Windows 10 and bringing them over to the Settings app. The Creators Update isn’t any different, either. Firstly, there’s a new dedicated page for Gaming settings, and there’s now a central place to control everything related to apps from the new Apps page. Microsoft has even upgraded the Bluetooth device setup experience, which feels a lot more streamlined than the old experience. In addition to this, there is a new Troubleshoot area under the Update & Security section that lets you find and fix problems related to the different parts of your PCs – these are just shortcuts to the old troubleshooter in Windows, so Microsoft still has a lot of work to do in truly modernizing the Control Panel. Security Security is a significant part of the Windows 10 Creators Update. Unlike some of the previous updates, the Creators Update does not bring a lot for users but it still brings some key improvements to Windows that will help users keep their PC more secure. For the IT Pros, Microsoft is adding a lot of improvements to Windows Upgrade Analytics that will help IT Pros easily analyze their systems using deep insights gained from telemetry data. Microsoft is also including a whole range of new improvements to Windows Defender’s Advanced Threat Protection that debuted last year with the Anniversary Update. To sum it up, the Creators Update is pretty exciting even if you are an IT Pro or a security person. It is important to note that I didn’t get to try out these features made for IT Pros, so I wouldn’t really be able to comment on their usefulness. Dynamic Lock is the coolest new security feature in Windows 10 But for consumers, there are some key changes coming with the Creators Update. For example, Microsoft is adding a new Dynamic Lock feature to Windows 10 with the Creators Update that automatically locks your PC when you are away from your PC. Windows 10 achieves this via Bluetooth – you’ll have to pair your phone with your PC via Bluetooth, and Windows 10 will automatically lock your PC when your phone is away from your PC. It’s a neat feature that will make sure no one access your PC when you are away from it. There’s an entirely new Windows Defender app The main new change in the Windows 10 Creators Update when it comes to security is the new Windows Defender, however. Redmond has completely revamped the Windows Defender app in Windows 10, and there’s now a new “Windows Defender Security Center” app built for Windows 10 devices that offers a much more modern experience that’s a lot easier to use than the classic defender. There are 5 different sections in the new Windows Defender:  Virus & Threat Protection, Device Performance & Health, Firewall & Network Protection, App & Browser Control and Family Options. The Virus & Threat Protection is where you can perform a quick scan for virus on your machine, and Microsoft is providing a whole set of different settings that you can enable to make your PC more secure and virus-free. The Device Performance & Health section, on the other hand, gives you info on your device’s health – for instance, if a device driver isn’t performing as expected, you will get a warning. I am not quite sure why this is under Windows Defender, but Microsoft probably has some sort of explanation for that. The Firewall & Network protection area is a bit disappointing – what it basically does is show your firewall’s status and it links to some settings that takes you to the classic Control Panel where you can control the different firewall configurations. Microsoft probably didn’t have enough time to modernize all of this, so I assume it will be a while until you will be able to control the firewall settings right from the Windows Defender app. And lastly, the App & Browser Control section lets you control the settings for SmartScreen and Microsoft Edge’s SmartScreen, too. Additionally, you can also setup SmartScreen for Windows Store apps by checking the web content used by your Windows 10 apps which is pretty neat. Oh, there’s also a Family Options area, but once again, you can’t control any of these right from the app – instead, the app takes you to Microsoft Account’s web app which is…not so user-friendly? Microsoft also has a new feature that will help newbie users avoid installing malware on their PCs. The new feature allows users to prevent Win32 apps and UWP apps that aren’t from the Windows Store – essentially blocking users from downloading apps that could potentially harm their PC. This feature is disabled by default for obvious reasons, and users can easily enable it if they want. When you enable the feature, you can either choose to completely block installation of apps that aren’t from the Windows Store or you can choose to offer an option that will allow you to install an app if you really want to. Preventing malware on your PC is much easier now This feature still lets you download Win32 apps – but you will only be able to download Win32 apps that are available on the Windows Store. At the moment, not a lot of Win32 apps are available on the Windows Store but apps like Evernote and Slack are some of the best Win32 apps that you can get from the store. While this feature is really useful when it comes to avoiding malware, it isn’t really accessible easily. The feature is in the Settings app’s new Apps section, and that’s difficult to find – especially for the average joe who likely isn’t an expert in such stuff. The security improvements coming with the Windows 10 Creators Update are really quite huge, both for IT Pros and consumers. The security enhancements in the Creators Update take Windows 10’s security a step further, and that is not anything surprising to see – especially since Windows 10 is supposed to be the most secure of Windows ever. New Setup Experience Microsoft is entirely redesigning the setup experience (aka OOBE) in Windows 10 with the Creators Update. The new OOBE in Windows 10 includes a brand-new user interface, and Windows 10’s personal assistant is integrated right into the setup experience, too. The new OOBE experience’s user interface is much cleaner than the previous OOBE which had elements that were still following the Windows 8.x design. The new OOBE, however, features a full Windows 10 design from the start to finish and it’s purely a much better experience when it comes to the design of the new OOBE. The best thing about the new OOBE is the fact that users can configure their privacy settings before the OS is properly setup. If you are concerned about your privacy in Windows 10, you can disable things like relevant ads, speech recognition and location tracking on the device right from the OOBE which is going to be really useful for users who are concerned about their privacy. Cortana is now integrated into the setup experience in Windows 10 The main part of the new OOBE is Cortana integration, however. Windows 10’s personal assistant is now integrated right into the OOBE and you can use your voice to setup your PC really easily thanks to the Cortana integration. When you first get into the new OOBE, Cortana will pop-up and walk you through the whole setup process in Windows 10. The Cortana integration in the OOBE is a nice addition, but it can get infuriating really quickly as setting up Windows 10 with Cortana takes a lot more time than the old method. Don’t get me wrong, the experience is really nice when you try it out for the first time, but if you clean-install your device frequently or have to setup a lot of PCs as part of your job, it might get really annoying pretty quickly. Thankfully though, you can disable Cortana in the OOBE if you would rather user your keyboard and mouse to setup Windows 10. But turning off Cortana in the OOBE is also quite irritating as there isn’t a single button or shortcut to turn it off – instead, you will have to use the volume slider to turn Cortana off and that’s quite an annoyance. I realize that it’s just a simple volume slider, but a keyboard shortcut or button to turn Cortana off instantly would be a much, much nicer replacement. What would be even better is if Microsoft disabled Cortana by default and allowed users to enable it if they want to use their voice to setup Windows 10 instead. Windows Store Windows Store is receiving some minor new upgrades with the Windows 10 Creators Update. The new features in Windows Store are not major by any means, but they play a huge role in making the Windows Store a better app store in general. The Windows Store is a lot more refined now Microsoft has overhauled how games look in the Windows Store. Previously, games and apps had a similar UI for listings, but games now have a much prettier UI. For instance, the hero image no longer takes up the whole space on the header – instead, it only takes a portion of it and the app icon and details overflows over it nicely. This change, once again, is not gigantic, but the changes make game listings a lot prettier on the Windows Store. You can also now purchase books from the Windows Store…if you live in the United States, that is. Buying books from the Windows Store isn’t any different from buying apps, games, music and movies from the Windows Store – when you hit the Buy button, you can pay for the book via the payment methods that are already setup on your Microsoft Account. And once you buy the book, you can open it up and start reading it from the new book reading experience in Microsoft Edge. It’s very nicely integrated. And lastly, the Windows Store now shows installation progress on the Action Center. This is also a new feature for the Action Center that allows developers to display in-line progress bar within notifications which was a much-needed addition. As for the Windows Store, when you start downloading a new game or start installing a new app, you will see its download or install progress right from the Action Center without needing to open the Store to check its progress. Windows Store is evolving with the Creators Update, just like most of the other main components of Windows 10. The improvements contribute towards making Windows Store a slightly better content store, but it still lacks some major features such as a Wishlist – and mostly notably: a reliable search functionality. Everything Else There’s a lot of new things in the Creators Update that we simply can’t cover in a single review. Microsoft has added a lot of minor new stuff to the OS and improved some of the existing features with the Creators Update, so here’s a quick rundown of some of the smaller new features: Night Mode There’s a new night mode in Windows 10, called “Night Light.” What this feature essentially does is automatically reduce the amount of blue light produced by your computer’s display, which supposedly helps you sleep better at night. Night Mode in Windows 10 can be enabled manually from the Action Centre, you can also set it up to automatically kick off depending on when the sun sets, or you can specify a period of time during which Night Mode will be enabled every day. Additionally, you can also configure the intensity of it, so it’s basically a full-featured F.lux-alternative that’s built right into the OS. Night Light is one of the best new features in the Creators Update Night Mode is a fantastic addition to Windows 10, but it needs some improvements. At the moment, night mode kicks in with full intensity when it’s activated rather than gradually increasing the intensity over time similar to how F.lux works. You probably won’t notice this issue at first, but it can get really distracting when the Night Mode is enabled with full intensity from the get go. It would have been a much better experience if there was an option to let the intensity increase over time. Windows Ink Microsoft has added a nifty little protractor tool to Windows Ink with the Creators Update. Additionally, you can now resume working on previous sketches that you weren’t able to finish which was a much-needed addition. The Windows Ink API also now powers Microsoft Edge’s Web Notes feature, so that should provide improved reliability. Picture-in-picture mode There is a new picture-in-mode for apps, simply called the new CompactOverlay. Universal Windows Platform developers can integrate this feature into their UWP apps, and it essentially allows them to show an overlay window that floats over all the other apps in Windows 10. For instance, the Movies & TV app in Windows 10 supports the new picture-in-picture mode and it shows the video you are currently playing on a small overlay that shows up on top of all the other apps in Windows 10 when enabled. Windows Update Windows Update will now take less time to install huge updates Microsoft is introducing a new Unified Update Platform (UUP) for Windows Update in Windows 10 with the Creators Update that will make the upgrade process a lot faster. When Microsoft releases the next Windows 10 update, users on the Creators Update won’t have to download the whole update – instead, only the required files will be downloaded, so UUP works like delta updates. As a result, users won’t have to download a 3-4GB update – instead, they will only have to download 1-2GB which is really nice. There are some other key changes in Windows Update – for instance, you can now pause updates for up to 7 days, and you can now set Active Hours for up to 18 hours, too (which was a much-requested feature). A new Share UI Microsoft is finally upgrading the Share feature’s design in Windows 10 which used to have the classic Windows 8 design for a while. But now, it follows the Windows 10 design and looks much nicer than the previous one. The new Share UI is much more user-friendly and fits nicely into Windows 10. Along with the new Share UI, there is also a revolutionary new share icon which is an interesting change, to say the latest. The old share icon in Windows 10 looked pretty nice, but the new share icon brings in some consistency when compared to other platform and it’s slightly more recognizable by newbies. These are some of the new minor features in the Creators Update, but there are a whole lot of other smaller features throughout the OS that’s coming with the Creators Update. Conclusion Windows 10 Creators Update is a step in the right direction for Microsoft. Redmond is not trying anything far-reaching with the Creators Update, but it’s instead focusing on the small things. Because, well, small things matter. Mixed Reality might be huge for Microsoft in the future Major new features such as Paint 3D and Windows Mixed Reality are not supposed to be mainstream yet – they are laying the groundwork for the future of Windows which is arguably quite ambitious. These features are undeniably incomplete at the moment, but what matters the most is whether Mixed Reality becomes a mainstream product for Microsoft. It is highly likely that augmented reality, mixed reality and virtual reality are going to be one of the biggest technologies in the near future, and Microsoft definitely does not want to miss out on the huge opportunity if they want to dominate the future of computing. These features might sound pointless to the average joe now, but the picture will be radically different in the future — at least that’s what Microsoft is hoping. Microsoft is obviously not forgetting about the present: the Creators Update brings a lot for consumers, and things like Night Light, custom accent colors, Cortana’s Pick Up Where You Left Off, Microsoft Edge’s tab management features, the improved Windows Update and even the new OOBE are some really neat additions to Windows 10. These new features are not perfect by any means, but Windows 10 is always changing and getting better with every update. The Windows 10 Creators Update isn’t just for creators To sum things up, the Creators Update for Windows 10 is yet another meaningful update to the operating system. It does not bring anything ground-breaking — and that’s perfectly fine, but it brings small new things throughout the whole OS to make the experience much better for users. The Creators Update makes Windows 10 a lot more refined, and it lays the groundwork for what Microsoft sees as the future of computing. There is no doubt that Microsoft still has a lot to do in the future – but that is really the whole purpose of Windows 10 and Microsoft’s Windows as a Service plans: it’s always getting better. The Breakdown Pros Paint 3D is really neat if you have the right devices Custom color accents are finally here Dynamic Lock is really neat when it works Microsoft Edge's book reading experience is powerful Night Mode helps you sleep better at night Cons Windows Mixed Reality requires a lot of work Microsoft Edge needs more frequent updates Game Broadcasting is a hit or miss Cortana's Pick Up Where You Left Off isn't ready for prime time and only works for users in the United States 8.4 Paint 3D 8.8Mixed Reality 7.5Gaming 7.7Microsoft Edge 8.2Cortana 8.5Desktop 8.9Security 8.5OOBE 8.3Windows Store 8.2Others 8.9 Tweet Share 0 Comments (0) Written, designed, and developed by Mehedi Hassan Top

In fact, it's a growing business. That's according to developers who license the smart glasses technology from Google Glass' enterprise-focused "Glass at Work" program. Google unveiled the smart glasses at its I/O conference in April 2012 in a high-profile demonstration featuring skydivers, and rolled them out to developers a year later. But the product was pricey at $1,500, and not particularly stylish. Onlookers were also concerned about the glasses recording them without their knowledge, which led to several Glass-wearers being attacked in public. Google discontinued Glass as a consumer product in 2015. But a version for the workplace lives on. "It's a big market today, and it will be an even bigger one in the future," said Brian Ballard, founder and chief executive officer at Upskill, a Google Glass partner that makes augmented reality apps for workers in the field. Its customers — and as of recently, its investors — include industrial giants like Boeing and GE. Upskill works with other smart glasses makers as well, like Intel, Microsoft and Vuzix. Ballard declined to comment on how many units it has deployed, but he did say it is targeting companies that will need "thousands of these devices in the field to do one job." Where Google could boost the business further and stand out from competitors, he says, is by adding advanced computing, like machine learning, to its offering. An example might be in incorporating computer vision technology so field workers simply have to snap photos for the purposes of documentation. Augmedix, a San Francisco-based start-up with nearly 1,000 employees, built its business off smart glasses. Unlike Upskill, the vast majority of its customers — doctors at large hospitals — are using Google Glass. CEO Ian Shakil said the company expects to deploy 1,000 Google Glass devices by the end of the year. Augmedix sells its application to 12 hospitals, including Dignity Health, Sutter Health and TriHealth, to help doctors transcribe notes from patient interactions. Doctors wear the glasses during consultations and transmit video to medical scribes, who take notes. That way, the doctors are freed up to focus on the patients. Shakil wouldn't tell us how much the company pays Google but says it's in the realm of $1,500, which is the price Google charged developers for the original product. Augmedix, which raised $23 million in December, is poised to triple its growth year over year, said Shakil. Thus far, he said, most patients seem open to their doctors wearing the device: "We've already done tens of thousands of patient interactions."
