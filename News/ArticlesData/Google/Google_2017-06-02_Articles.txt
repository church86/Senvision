(3 letters) Apple Inc. is already in your pocket, on your desk and underneath your television. Soon, a device embossed with “Designed by Apple in California” may be on your nightstand or kitchen counter as well. The iPhone-maker has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference this month, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said. The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss products that aren’t yet public. Introducing a speaker would serve two main purposes: providing a hub to automate appliances and lights via Apple’s HomeKit system, and establishing a bulwark inside the home to lock customers more tightly into Apple’s network of services. That would help combat the competitive threat from Google’s and Amazon’s connected speakers: the Home and Echo mostly don’t support services from Apple. Without compatible hardware, users may be more likely to opt for the Echo or Home, and therefore use streaming music offerings such as Spotify, Amazon Prime Music or Google Play rather than Apple Music. “This will be a platform for developing Apple’s services,” says Gene Munster, a co-founder of Loup Ventures and former Apple analyst. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has emphasized Apple’s services businesses over the past 18 months as iPhone sales slowed. He expects service revenue to double by 2020 from last year’s $24 billion. A speaker may help keep customers loyal to service products such as Apple Music, a subscription music streaming offering that costs $10 per month. The speaker would likely be tucked into Apple’s “Other Products” category, which currently includes devices like the Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods. That set of products generated $11 billion in sales last year. Inventec Corp., the Taipei manufacturer that already makes the AirPod wireless headphones, will add the speaker to its Apple repertoire, the people said. Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their homes for several months, they said. The Siri speaker reached an advanced prototype stage late last year, Bloomberg News reported at the time. An Inventec representative didn’t respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours in Taiwan. This year’s developers conference will be the first since 2013 to introduce new hardware. Apple could announce updated iPad tablets at the conference, one of the people said. Apple last updated the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016 and hasn’t refreshed the larger 12.9-inch model since its November 2015 debut. Planned Mac updates will include refreshed versions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro with faster Intel Corp. processors, Bloomberg News reported last month. Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product’s development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple also has considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said. Apple also will likely let third-party services build products for the speaker. Last year, Apple opened up Siri on the iPhone to the likes of Uber Technologies Inc. and Facebook Inc., allowing a user to order a ride or send a WhatsApp message with a voice command. The device will be a hub for Apple’s HomeKit home automation system, letting users control devices such as lights, door locks and window blinds. At present, an Apple TV or iPad is required to control that equipment from outside the home or automatically. The Echo and Google Home both support third-party services and smart home appliances. Ahead of Apple’s launch, the competition has upgraded their speakers with support for making voice calls, while Amazon’s gained a touchscreen. Apple’s speaker won’t include such a screen, according to people who have seen the product. An Apple-designed speaker with high-end sound quality that fits perfectly into the Apple ecosystem is a familiar pitch. In 2006, Apple unveiled the iPod Hi-Fi, a battery powered speaker designed to cast a shadow over the thriving iPod third-party accessory market. With its bulky size and high price point, the Hi-Fi flopped and was discontinued within 18 months of launching. With Siri and a clear hole in its ecosystem, Apple is banking that its second try at a speaker product will do better.

Google family calendars are going live Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 3:27pm PDTJun 3, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 129 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares221 Google News Last month, Google consolidated all of its family-sharing products under the new Family groups feature. From the new Family page, you can easily manage who has access to YouTube TV, Keep notes, content from Google Play, and more. Another component of Family groups, a shared calendar, is going now live for some users. The premise behind the family calendar is simple. When you create a family on Google, a calendar called 'Family' automatically appears for all members in Google Calendar. Anyone in the family can modify events and rename the calendar, but non-family members cannot be added. While this isn't a groundbreaking feature, as sharing a calendar between Google accounts has been possible for years, this does make sharing events between family members a bit simpler. In addition, this also avoids duplicate calendar events when one member shares an event with another. Let us know if you have it in the comments below.

Artem Russakovskii If you have a significant other, you needed to invite them to stuff, which would create a duplicate event in their calendar. Then they'd reply yes, which would create an extra notification for yourself. Now imagine you've set up calendar sharing like I have. I see my wife's, she sees mine - a common use case. Our calendars are filled with duplicate events. If you have more adult family members, it gets even messier. Family calendar resolve these duplication issues for us - it's a fantastic addition. keithzg Fair enough, although I was never necessarily assuming there weren't permutations to this that would be helpful to other people. In my own instance the "Family" group is my parents and my sister, who lives in an entirely different city. I can't think of a single situation where this setup would have been that helpful. What I remain unclear on, though, is how this resolves things better than if you and your wife had a shared calendar that you put common events into, since isn't this just essentially a pre-created such calendar? Artem Russakovskii Damn. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. catalysto How is this different from just creating a single calendar to share? You can already do that with anyone (I thought). It allows for a single event to be shown only once on each person's calendar -- no duplicates. Artem Russakovskii That's... a fair point. I'm not sure why it's better or worse, actually. Even though we use a shared calendar on AP, I never thought of creating one for our family. Doh. John O’Gara This is exactly what my wife asked me when she read about the feature. We had been using several shared calendars for our household for years now. Grey Why not resolve that issue of inviting creating a duplicate issue rather than introduce this shared calendar? And then leave inviting people creating duplicate events? Anyway, I think everything will change with the Google Calendar refresh, so discussing this might be a moot point. random I never really saw a need to invite my wife to shared events. We share our calendars at the highest permission level, and if there is something that we both do, it sits on one calendar and we know that it applies to both. Merlyn Nak-nak Clemente Ich bin der Mann der euch das Angstspürren spüren läst.meine Frau ist mir scheiss egal.meine kinder sind mir wischtiger erptastic k. Artem Russakovskii Went live for me today. Finally no more inviting my wife to all the stuff we do together. Peter I'm too lazy to check, but i assume this isn't available to G Suite accounts? Peter To answer my own question, yeah GSuite not supported. keithzg Yeah, but you have Hangouts Chat whereas we all know that Hangouts is gonna eventually stop working for the rest of us, so it all balances out ;) Deborahthampton Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Grey I really hope we all get Hangouts Chat. It's not live for anyone yet, but I really hope it replaces regular Hangouts. It's a true modern chat service from Google with lots of necessary base features AND new and exciting features. It's what Allo should have been if the dev team didn't focus on Stickers. Bru [971] "If Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone." Maybe Google is trying to save the few conversation Billy still has with his parents when he's not playing video games haha keithzg One of the problems is that family members are not notified when an event changes, so if Billy's basketball game starts an hour early, you'll have to remind everyone. Hmm, but in the screenshot right above in the article it shows a checkbox saying "Changed events: receive an update when somebody changes an event." If that's only actually for if somebody outside of the Family Group changes an event, that's pretty bad wording on Google's part. Corbin Davenport Nope, I was originally wrong. Fixed the post. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Now if only I could use it with G Suite. Spy Katcher Google keeps nipping around the edges of actually making something useful like integrating Calendar with Google Home. C'mon guys and gals GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!!!! Bill Latronica I always wonder why money paying G Suite account holders don't get these features first. Makes no sense to me. (Grumble Grumble) Tv One feature I'd like to see with this is the ability to disable individual family members on specific Google products. For example, we have the grandparents as part of our family group. The "Family Group" sharing is useful for Play Music and Photos, but they don't need to be part of shared Keep and Calendar items.

Scientists Say About Trump's Paris Climate Deal Decision Make Your Own Bootleg HoloLens With The Cardboard Holokit Rhett Jones Jun 4, 2017, 9:00am ⋅ Filed to:  augmented reality cardboard clips gadgets holokit hololens Share While the world catches up with VR, imperfect but affordable options for entry like Google Cardboard and Samsung's Gear VR will get the job done. But augmented/mixed reality is also proving itself to be a ripe new field and for anyone looking to dip their toes in the water of this brave new world, the Holokit has come to save the day. Image: Fengyuan Zhu Google's VR Headset Is So Comfortable I Never Want To Take It Off It isn't the games that really wow me when I slip on the Daydream View VR headset. It isn't the worlds that the Google Maps app allow me to visit. It isn't even the immediate sensation of wonder that VR still instills me. It's how comfortable the headset is. Read more Like Google Cardboard, the Holokit uses a cardboard frame to house a smartphone. Two mirrors reflect what appears on your smartphone onto an angled Fresnel lens. Unlike Google Cardboard, you want to see through this setup because you're mixing reality with imagery coming from your phone. Unfortunately, like Cardboard, there's no headstrap. But you can always make your own. Open source tracking software will be released on GitHub along with the headset on June 6, 2017. Amber Garage is a startup focused on augmented reality. Its founder Botao Hu showed off the little DIY kit this week at the Augmented World Expo. A price hasn't been announced yet but it seems reasonable to say it will cost more than the $US15 ($20) that Google Cardboard does and less than the $US100 ($134) or so that headsets like Gear VR go for. Checking out the video demonstration, it's safe to say that this will be a big step down from an actual Hololens but the lowest tier development kits for that device for $US3000 ($4031). It's hard to say if what you see is going to look totally bootleg or if it's just tough to capture with a camera. Probably a little of both. Regardless, I like the low-res vibe. This is a perfect way for developers to tinker around with the technology without having to make such a major investment. I'm sure the lawyers at the software giant will be taking some issue with that name but Microsoft's developers should seriously consider making one of these themselves. I look forward to playing with all the stuff you guys make for this thing. Check it out for yourself in the video below and it should be available here on June 6.

Here's what they had to say. NYPD Fails To Convince Court Its Deafening Sound Cannon Is Just A 'Communication Tool' Sidney Fussell 03 Jun 2017 1:00 PM On Wednesday, a US federal judge ruled that the sound emitted from the NYPD's Long Range Acoustic Devices -- portable sound cannons that blast noise -- could be considered a use of force, contrary to the police department's claims. The LRAD can blast sound as loudly as 136 decibels. That's louder than a jackhammer or a jet engine and above the 120 db threshold for immediate human hearing loss. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

But really how smart are a bunch of different devices all speaking different languages? Unfortunately, the smart home can be very stupid and often takes longer to set up than breathless advertisements imply. We're here to tell you how you can build a smart home where everything works in harmony. How Smart Do You Want Your Home to Be? As we've recently noted, not much in the smart home world is truly universal yet, but hardware and software makers are slowly catching on. Devices like the Chromecast, Sonos speakers, and Eero routers simplify setups that were once painfully complicated — only people of a certain age will ever appreciate how magical it is to tap a button and have video instantly beamed from smartphone to television. A good starting point is to work out whether you want to dabble in the smart home scene or go all-in with your automation, and we've covered both choices below. Going device by device is easier and cheaper, but can get messy and prove hard to upgrade; committing to one platform and hub is more limiting for now but may pay off later down the line. While we'll do our best to guide you towards a kit that's compatible, and explain the competing standards out there right now, the truth is we're not yet at the stage where everything in the Internet of Things speaks happily to everything else — that's still a way off. You can either automate a lot around the home, and control everything separately, or go through one central hub, and take what you get. The Coolest Smart Home Innovations In 2017 There's an abundance of amazing home smart tech hitting the market. From Samsung's Family Hub 2.0 fridge to the Amazon Alexa and Google Home (hopefully) finally hitting our shores. But there's more to the smart home than gadgets. Let's take a look at how home automation and new tech like Tesla battery storage, smart thermostats, grid credits and smart meters are revolutionising our power consumption. Which also has a positive impact on both the environment and our bank accounts. Read more Image: Gizmodo Taking a piecemeal approach Image: LIFX We've mentioned that individual aspects of the smart home is slowly improving, and if you're buying a one-off device, chances are you're going to be very impressed: buy an Amazon Echo, or a Nest thermostat, or a Philips Hue lightbulb, and you can add a little intelligence to your humble home in minutes. You can even rig something up yourself. Thanks to the ubiquitous Wi-Fi most of us now enjoy, getting devices online and connected is easier than ever, which means mobile control from the palm of our hands is pretty straightforward. You can get smart locks, smart lights, smart fridges, and more besides, and generally speaking, the user experience is getting up to somewhere near a respectable standard after several years of hits and misses. The benefits of making one-off additions to your smart home are that everything should just work the first time, and you can keep costs down too. Focus on the parts of your house you want to make a little cleverer (like your air conditioner) and leave the rest in blissful ignorance for the time being. Image: Nest The big downsides? Everything in your home has a separate app and nothing works together. You can't dim the lights and slide down the blinds, or open your garage and unlock the door, or do anything else at the same time and in the same app without embracing one of the (fledgling) platforms out there. There are workarounds, but they are just that: workarounds. Our favourite is the Field Guide regular IFTTT (If This Then That). It can tie together different smart home gadgets with impressive skill. It can do tricks like getting your Echo to talk to your Nest or keeping your lights and heating in sync, but it's not ideal for building an overarching system. Yet it's still another layer of complexity and another app to deal with. All The Cool New Stuff Google Home Can Do Google just announced new updates to Assistant and Google Home. The smart speaker leans on Assistant to offer voice controls and artificially intelligent, well, assistance. But until now, the gadget hasn't really been able to do that much. Thanks to some updates, however, that might change very soon. Read more Choosing a platform Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Throwing everything behind one particular platform will save you from learning the ins and outs of IFTTT or keeping a dozen smart home apps on your phone. Yet none of these platforms are anywhere near perfect yet, which is why many people are sticking with the wait-and-see approach. The easiest way in to embracing a hub is to buy yourself an Amazon Echo or a Google Home and then pick up the rest of your kit based on what else is compatible. The Amazon Echo devices work with gear from the likes of Philips, Belkin, Honeywell, TP-Link and more — in fact, its growing support for third-party apps and products is probably where it's still strongest against Google's rival smart speaker. Google Home hasn't been around as long as the Echo, and it shows in terms of what else works with it (and the companion Google Home app). The list of working smart home products is less impressive than Amazon's. Though there are still some major mainstays. Manufacturers like Philips and Belkin have recently joined the Google party, and Nest and Dropcam devices work, but they're both now subsidiaries of Google. Which Virtual Butler Will Command The Servants In Your Smart Home? With Belkin's WeMo gadgets finally set to take orders from Apple's Siri, the smart home giants are vying for the coveted position of household butler – acting as liaison between the lord of the manor and your digital servants. Read more Image: Apple Apple HomeKit, meanwhile, has been with us since 2014 but is still waiting for its breakthrough moment. There's no always listening speaker to use, so you're stuck with your iPad, iPhone or Apple TV for controlling everything. Yet the number of gadgets with the works-with-HomeKit badge continues to grow and grow, and few smart home platforms offer the simplicity and ease-of-use of Apple's app. If you don't want Apple, Google, or Amazon running your smart home, then SmartThings (now owned by Samsung) is another option. It's the most comprehensive out there at the moment, with a plethora of supported devices, from SmartThings brand sensors and switches to third-party kits from the usual smart home suspects like Philips, Belkin, Netgear, and Ecobee. It even offers integration with both the Amazon Echo or Google Home. Yet set up can be almost as bothersome as the IFTTT solution. So SmartThings isn't recommended if you don't have a full afternoon set aside for getting things going. Wink is a direct rival to SmartThings and has a list of compatible devices and services that are just as impressive. As with SmartThings, you can hook Wink gear up with Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa, and everything is handled with one central hub. We haven't had the best of experiences with Wink in the past, but we're prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt and imagine it's got better over the last couple of years. Plus, as we've already said, no smart home platform is perfect right now. Other platforms are available, but we'd suggest sticking to those five options for now, even if it's hard to predict which way the smart home market will turn next. In a lot of ways it's down to who you trust to make the best software, sign the best deals and attract the most developers in the next few years — and then you'll really have a smart home to be proud of. Smart Home Devices That Will Save You Time, Money And Energy To say I'm a fan of smart homes is an understatement. Being a renter I'm limited somewhat as to what I can have in my apartment, but that hasn't stopped me from integrating as many smart devices into my environment as humanly possible. One thing I've discovered a long the way — not only have I saved a lot of effort (regular light switches are for plebs, you guys), but I've saved time, money and kilowatts on my energy bill. Here's my top recommendations for doing the same at your place. Read more WATCH MORE: Home Ideas & Life Hacks Comments bobwilliams @bobwilliams Jun 5, 2017, 11:47am I've been using HomeBridge https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge on a Raspberry Pi 3 for a while now and it's been very reliable for adopting HomeKit where everything "just works". I use LIFX blubs, Logitech Harmony, Belkin Wemo Switches and August Smart Lock. Wouldn't recommend for the tech-averse, but there are plenty of online tutorials to get it set up. Everything works as you would expect and I'm not subject to the enormous premium slapped on HomeKit-badged devices that take 12-18 months before Apple approves them for release.

Ongoing secrecy around the NBN, a project that’s likely to cost more than A$50 billion, makes it impossible for the public in most cases to know when and what quality service they will receive. Further, new research shows the NBN rollout was politically motivated and socioeconomically biased from the beginning. It is perhaps time to remind ourselves of the ups and downs of the project that was once announced as a dream national infrastructure project for the 21st century. This requires a ten-year journey back in time, before we can figure out what needs to be done next.

Using this website, you will be able to easily create a GIF by drawing a comparison between two different data sets. To draw a data comparison, all you got to do is enter two data points, add data titles, choose a different color for each data, and enter the explanatory text for both the data. You can also decide whether you want to show the data evaluation in “percentage” or “addition”. After that, you can simply play the data comparison online or download it as an animated GIF. Ultimately, you can use this website to show your simple data in a more visually appealing way with the help of an animated GIF. Sponsored Links Google has been developing some simple, useful, and interesting web applications like AutoDraw, A Google A Day, and more. And this time they have come up with “Data GIF Maker” to help you visualize your simple data comparison in an animated GIF. The best part of this website is that it doesn’t restrict you to any specific type of data, which also means the data comparison can be drawn between anything like search percentage of two keywords, population of two countries, the popularity of two superheroes, critic rating of two movies, fat burning capability of two foods, and so on. How to Create an Animated GIF of Data using this Data Visualization Website by Google: To get started, simply visit the homepage of Data GIF maker.

This will open a new window where you can play the data comparison by pressing “Spacebar” or enable the “Autoplay” option on the widget for playing it automatically. If you want to download the data comparison as animated GIF, then click on the “Download as GIF” button. After that, it will ask whether you want to download a low-resolution GIF or a high-resolution GIF. When you select either option, it will start rendering your GIF and in a minute or two, you will get your animated GIF.

Allo in particular has been getting a lot of attention lately from Google, and this time it’s getting a Selfie Clips feature for capturing and sharing your personal GIF. The new feature was announced by Allo’s head of product Amit Fulay, who said that Selfie Clips will be added to the chat app for users to share their personal GIF. Fulay confirmed this in a tweet during the week. Softpedia reports that the new Selfie Clips feature will allow you to capture and share your own personal GIFs with your friends and loved ones on Allo. Explaining how the feature works, Fulay said Allo users who receive a sticker can emulate it with their own face. Next step is to select the GIF option under the “+” menu and record your own short clip that looks like the sticker previously received by you. After recording the short clip, Google Allo moves on to automatically loop the video and put it into GIF form. Finally, you can share the GIF with your friends and loved ones. By now, every iOS and Android users must have received the new feature, and perhaps, started sharing their own GIFs with their friends and family. Not done with adding the Selfie Clips feature, Google has also redesigned the compose bar in the chat app. Some users, according to Softpedia have already started noticing the new ways to share content, which is faster than normal. The Selfie Clips feature uses neural network to create personalized selfie sticks for users. Google also collaborated with various artists to make the stickers more attractive to users. Before launching the feature, the Mountain View California-based tech giant tested it among human raters. Talking about neural network, last April, Google rolled out an exciting feature that will turn all your selfies into cartoon stickers. The method will involve using machine learning and neural networks to map out your facial features to animated versions designed by popular artist Lamar Abrams, a storyboard artist, writer, and designer for the popular Cartoon Network series Steven Universe. Once designed, you can then go ahead to customize the cartoon stickers to suit your taste. The whole idea behind the new feature is explained in details by Google on its research blog. Google’s approach will be to first explore how it could enable an algorithm to pick out some basic features in a particular manner from your image. The new tool is integrated into the Allo chat app, and can be located when you pull up the list of stickers you can use to respond to conversations where you will find an option: “Turn a selfie into stickers.” Once you tap this option, it prompts you to take a selfie. From there and then, Google’s image-recognition algorithms will analyze your face, and map out your features to the ones in a kit. Got something to add to this story?

Via the official Google blog, the company’s Senior Vice President of Ads and Commerce, Sridhar Ramaswamy announced that: “We plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018.” Chrome is currently the dominant desktop web browser, with around 41.6% market share, and while mobile usage is on the rise, the use of ad blocking is significantly more prominent on desktop (18% vs 1% on mobile, according to the latest Mary Meeker Internet Trends report). Google’s hoping that by addressing user concerns on desktop, they can avoid the rise of ad blockers on mobile devices, while also maintaining more control over the market they rely upon for their revenue. In terms of which ads, specifically, will be penalized, Google’s referring to research conducted by the Coalition for Better Ads, of which they, themselves, are a founding member. As explained by Ramaswarmy: “The vast majority of online content creators fund their work with advertising. That means they want the ads that run on their sites to be compelling, useful and engaging - ones that people actually want to see and interact with. But the reality is, it’s far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web - like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page. These frustrating experiences can lead some people to block all ads, taking a big toll on the content creators, journalists, web developers and videographers who depend on ads to fund their content creation.” Over the past few years, ad blocking has risen to become the spectre of doom for online marketing - while more and more people are spending more of their time online, ad blocking adoption is also rising. According to research (and combining the above data on mobile and desktop usage), around 11% of all web users now use ad blocking in some form, a rate which has increased 30% year-on-year. And notably, ad blocker adoption rates are increasing steadily in some of the core global markets for the big tech giants. Source: PageFair Adblock report 2017 That’s obviously a huge concern for both Facebook and Google, who collectively capture around 77% of total digital ad spend, where both generate the vast majority of their income. To counter this, Facebook has tried blocking ad blockers on their platform to ensure their ads are still shown, while Google’s sought to penalize pages which provide poor ad experiences, like intrusive pop-ups, amongst various other efforts. Each of these initiatives has generated mixed results - but through their Chrome option, Google may have a more substantial measure to lean on, one which could help it better police ad quality and, in turn, reduce the adoption of ad blockers. As noted, both Google and Facebook are members of The Coalition for Better Ads, which was founded last year in partnership with a group of leading international trade associations and companies involved in online media. The group’s aim is, essentially, to combat the rise of ad blocking by pooling their knowledge and resources in an effort to develop and implement new global standards for online advertising to avoid annoying misuses of ad content. According to Oliver von Wersch, Managing Director of Gruner+Jahr and a member of the Coalition: “The breadth of this Coalition emphasizes our belief that a unified, industry-wide effort will drive the change consumers want.” This is the key impetus for the Coalition’s existence, to formulate a plan to find out what’s driving users to use ad blockers, then eliminating those experiences. And they’re already producing results – back in February, YouTube, which is owned by Google, announced that it would be removing unskippable, 30 second pre-roll ads, one of the more frustrating digital ad offerings. Just last month, Facebook announced that it’s introducing a new measure within its algorithm to reduce the reach of content from sites which are loaded with intrusive ads. While neither of these announcements came as a direct result of the Coalition’s formation, both are linked back to trends and ad content identified by the Coalition’s research as problematic, leading to action. Of course, giving Google control over which ads it will and won’t show also gives them something of a market advantage – they could, for example, start blocking non-Google ads in order to boost the value of their own offerings. That’s an element that regulatory bodies will no doubt be watching, but on balance, the overall impetus and aims for the Chrome blocker make sense, and should help deliver a better user experience. In order to help brands prepare for the coming change, Google has also announced a new Ad Experience Report to help publishers understand how the Better Ads Standards apply to their own websites. The tool provides screenshots and videos of annoying ad experiences Google’s systems have identified as problematic, in order to make it easier for publishers to find and fix the issues. Google’s also adding a new initiative called ‘Funding Choices’ which will enable publishers to show a customized message to visitors who are using an ad blocker, inviting them to “either enable ads on their site, or pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor”. It’ll be interesting to see how those measures are adopted and whether they help improve the user experience. Google’s announcements underline that ad blockers are a serious concern for digital marketing, but also, that the major players have measures they can lean on to limit their use. Right now, at 11% adoption, ad blockers are a concern, but rather than neuter them entirely, Google and Facebook are looking at the underlying issues, the problems that lead to the use of blockers in the first place, which is a much more sustainable and productive approach. And if they can get rid of those intrusive, over the top ads, the web will be a better place for it. Google’s Chrome ad blocker will be released ‘early in 2018’. Funding Choices is now available to publishers in North America, U.K., Germany, Australia and New Zealand, and will be rolling out in other countries later this year.  Author Information Andrew Hutchinson @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

Alexa now supports reminders and named timers Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 10:28am PDTJun 3, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares154 News It has been a little over 200 days since the Google Home was officially released, and owners are still waiting on Google to implement support for reminders. Perhaps in response to the growing competition, Amazon has been hard at work improving Alexa, and has now added reminders and named timers to the assistant. The reminders work pretty much as you would expect - asking "remind me to take out the trash Sunday night" will prompt your Alexa-powered device to notify you when the time comes. The named timers can be created with phrases like, "Set an oven timer for 10 minutes." Amazon only explicitly mentioned the Echo in the announcement, so it's possible these features are limited to Amazon's own devices for now and could require a software update for others (I don't have an Alexa device to test). It also seems to be limited to the United States at the time of writing, for some reason. Tags alexa amazon assistant named timers reminders timers subscribe ...

Blue Sky Innovation Technology Google co-founder Sergey Brin reportedly building $100 million 'air yacht' to help the poor David Paul Morris / Bloomberg Sergey Brin, president of Alphabet and co-founder of Google, speaks at the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit at Stanford University in 2016. Sergey Brin, president of Alphabet and co-founder of Google, speaks at the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit at Stanford University in 2016. (David Paul Morris / Bloomberg) Hamza ShabanThe Washington Post Google co-founder Sergey Brin is spending more than $100 million to build the world's largest airship, a blimp with a rigid structure designed to both deliver supplies abroad for humanitarian projects and ferry Brin's family and friends around the globe, the Guardian newspaper reported. The project is the latest example of Silicon Valley attempting to reshape how goods and people are moved. But some say it also underscores a penchant for tech moguls to color their projects with seemingly virtuous ambition. Some people on social media seized on the vessel's apparent dual purpose. On the one hand, it's a benevolent carrier transporting food to remote, hard-pressed communities, and on the other it's a luxurious "air yacht," as the Guardian report described it, shuttling a billionaire and his inner circle to exotic locations. Google declined to comment. The vessel is reportedly being built at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. When completed, the airship will become the world's largest aircraft at about 650 feet long, although its payload is not known, according to the Guardian. Plans for the vessel, which is being funded by Brin, were first reported by Bloomberg earlier this year. Experts say that the use of airships could bypass the congestion and costs tied to transporting cargo via roads, railways and airports. But lighter-than-air travel presents its own challenges, like the need to steady the aircraft by offsetting the weight of cargo once it's offloaded. According to the Guardian, Brin's vessel will use a series of internal bladders to stabilize its flight. Brin began his plans to build the vessel about three years ago, according to Bloomberg. His fascination with airships was sparked by visits to the Ames Research Center, next to the headquarters of Google's parent company, Alphabet. Ames once housed the navy airship USS Macon, which spanned about 784 feet and was among the largest aircraft of its time in the 1930s. Silicon Valley's novel charitable efforts have been criticized in the past, perhaps most prominently in the case of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's internet.org initiative, which aims to bring Internet access to the billions of people who don't have it. With altruistic motives but lucrative business prospects, some see Zuckerberg's initiative less as a magnanimous Internet project than as a version of high-tech imperialism. It's unclear whether Brin's airship will be put to commercial use. But Larry Page, CEO of Alphabet and the other co-founder of Google, has also taken a keen interest in innovative aircraft. Page has personally backed two flying-car start-ups, Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero. Kitty Hawk's flyer, a personal electric aircraft that hovers over water, will be available for purchase later this year.

It sounds like the feature we spotted in a recent APK Teardown. The suggestions will appear as a card in the Assistant tab inside Photos. Google will use its machine learning magic to figure out what's in the photo, marking potentially unimportant ones for archiving.

Mustafa Selçuk Öztürk I got the update and it shows under Assistant Cards, but no suggestion yet. Waiting patiently... myssi it must be processing your photos brkshr This archiving feature is a godsend!!! My wedding and my honeymoon tour of 7 national parks takes up at least a third of the photo's I have saved from the past 15 years or so. I already archived about half of my wedding photo's. Now I just need to get through the metric ton of honeymoon photo's I have of nature and driving and it will be much easier to find the important photo's. Dennis Ulijn It's also important to solve this problem from the other end: start realizing which photos matter to you. Nature pictures? Architectural pictures? Portraits, group pictures? Nature and architecture are abundant, I just try to shoot the people I'm with, mostly spontaneously or without the knowing because I want to capture the moment. I don't have to archive many photos, and I do take a lot of pictures of my kids. abc Some people like nature more than people. :) Besides, the easiest solution is not take any pics at all because someone else in the group will do it and share them with you. Dennis Ulijn I doubt my toddlers will take a good picture ;-) well, to each their own. Sometimes avoiding the problem is simpler than solving it. Lourdesdcruz Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Facts Cool feature Erstam I wish they would adopt a folder and sub folder like structure. I would still much rather organize my photos that way. It suggested i archive all my screen shots. Meh. Rudder2 JunkMail I agree with you. I hate Google Photos' organization and use Google Drive instead because I like organizing my photos with folders and subfolders. Another beef with Google Photos is it doesn't recognize my Google Drive Photo folders as albums. Google has a lot to learn how people like to organize photos. The Google Drive help line tried to get me to switch to Google Photos and I gave him an ear load. I spend hours organizing my photos on my computer and Google just doesn't care and wants us to do it again in their app. Anon They need to let us archive entire folders automatically, like the whatsapp image folder Vlad > Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. No it's not. This is EXACTLY how it works in Gmail and how I count on it to work. Everything is still categorised, it's just not there when opening gmail.com Cakefish This is completely unrelated to the article but I'm getting very impatient waiting for Motorola and Nokia to reveal their 2017 phones. Do you have any news on release dates for us AP? DynamikD I'm glad about this feature. Great way to hide photos that you may not want to people to view. I don't quite understand why people still complain about not being able to create folders though. It's an archaic way of doing things. That's why you can create albums within photos. Serves the same function but it leverages meta data which is more efficient and makes searching for photos and videos easier within the app. Yuri Vidal if google photos would only give me the option to NOT BACKUP my screenshots... i hate it! (Samsung stores screenshots under /DCIM/Screenshots so, google photos thinks they are pictures and uploads them. There is no way to unselect this folder, since it is a subfolder of the pitures folder... PLEASE FIX THIS! Ozl This is just great! i have a lot of files being uploaded on wifi from whatsapp and some i forget to delete, and others are just there just in case, so yes, Thanks Google! Fruity101079 I thought this archive function was useless, and it is for me, but when i see your comments, i guess i was wrong. It seems to be useful to a lot of you who didn't take time to organize and arrange your photos.

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 83 Plus 1 on G+ 441 Share on Facebook 121 Share on Twitter Total Shares645 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Can get rid of those annoying app install ads when browsing on the phone! Corbin Davenport Yeah, I think those are included, since they stick to the top while scrolling. Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. My1 not really android related but when these things like get 10000 euro in a month easily show up in SKYPE, an application by MICROSOFT that hurts, and they even have HTTPS ads with certificate errors Eli Stevens I get the job done from convenience of my place, with very simple projects that only needs only from you a Desktop computer system as well as web connection and I am happier than before...

Cat Astrophy Deceptive is extremely hard to deal with and far more subjective. "Bad" can be virus ridden, or employing technical methods that can be detected automatically (like pop ups). Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. Cakefish ABP allows through Taboola, Outbrain and Revcontent. The polar opposite of acceptable ads. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... abc You can pay for it and I'll coast for free. Ha ha, I'm a dick! Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API Total Insecurity For some reason female users like this API... BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring My1 what the hell, how about they just pop a notif and let the phone do the rest? Imparus Okay so it was a bad example with facebook, since it is the notification API they are using not the vibration one, which means it follows the same rules as other applications. I should just have said a game might use it, but at the moment it is mainly used for BS ads. My1 okay, but I see no point in point in using the vibration on a website anyway. Imparus PWA, I mentioned game, since PWA is one of the new thing that is very likely to become huge in the next few years. Here you can try some few application made in it https://pwa.rocks/ so it is more that you should be ready for a paradigm change in what a website is, since the line between webapp and normal app will almost disappear. Example I use the QR scanner, so I don't have to have a dedicated app for it. My1 well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow. and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application. with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff Imparus I unfortunately don't have the time at the moment to explain all of these to you, so this will be quick rundown, and the rest you will have to research yourself if you are interested in it. "well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? " For most stuff it isn't a problem at all, as for game if they are simple enough optimization isn't as relevant. Most game would be written for an engine like unity or unreal, and one of the new thing in relation to PWA are modules, that will allow the use of engine like that, it also allow webapps to work completely offline. There will of course be some apps that are very heavy in computation on device that will make sense to run with native code that can run better, but there are being worked on optimizing things such as JS to make it run faster. "also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow." You can have the browser serve different code depending on the device, that actually isn't anything new. "and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. " PWA actually allow apps to work everywhere, instead of just the OS you coded it to. Having one single code base would be great for pretty much every company. "especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application." You can easily code for it to work offline, take the QR scanner on the side I linked you, I don't need internet to use it at all. Think of PWA like normal apps, if you use twitter then try using the PWA they have created. "with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff" Not really, this is one of the thing I will say you need to research yourself, since it will be quite a long explanation, I would start by looking into why chromeOS is more secure than Windows. I said there will be a huge grow with PWA over the next few years, since it is still very early in its development, only Firefox and Chrome support it at the moment and Edge will bring support in fall. AintaDamnThingFunny Right, but websites always ask me for permission if I want their notifications. Facebook using the vibrator API with your permission is one thing. Having an obtrusive add use it without your permission is another. Imparus That is because a website don't need to ask for permission, so it is more that Google should make it a permission check before allowing to use the vibration. Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! Rob Yeah, but some people love the vibrator API. hooch Holy shit I didn't even know this was a thing. Been using Firefox + uBlock Origin for a couple of years. blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. My1 cookie warning are annoying but it shows the scary relatity of all the sites that collect data with cookies. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Sonny Bono If they throw in free movies with the service I'd be down. I can already get anything I want on demand for no cost. I just appreciate watching random videos and I never know what I'm in the mood for. I'll just keep riding the links down the chain, bar tricks, gun porn, rocket engines, science experiments, old computers, animals and hunting videos... whatever it might be. ublock origin fixes the problem with ads - they don't exist any more - but not with popup windows on some questionable websites. abc Good for you. I use an adblocker and don't see any ads on Youtube. And I don't feel bad taking cents away from a multi-billion dollar corporation. I will never pay for streaming services because I like to own things. I could pay Netflix hundreds of dollars over the course of years, and the moment I disconnect, I am left with zero movies. I'd much rather grab some discs from the bargain bin. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Adam Margeson Forced Google surveys? Where are you seeing those served up? And, are you sure they're legitimately from Google? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but... Terra: how would you solve this on Chromecast, etc.?" tigerberry Playing a commercial WHILE PLAYING THE DAMN VIDEO I'M ACTUALLY WATCHING? Whoever came up with that should be forced to never use an adblocker ever again. Cakefish Wonderful. Please also add extension support to Android Chrome (it's the number 1 feature that it's missing, desktop Chrome wouldn't have been as popular without it) but this is a good start. Ghirahim Install Opera and have a wonderful life. Jun rip pornhub ads Rod I wonder when they will fix the Notification Download Service bug in v58. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719641# Rob Thank goodness. Somehow, we went from doing away with auto-play videos and ads years ago, only to have them pop up a lot in recent months. I'm sick of them. BC Google is finally making a move that I truly approve of. Ads, especially the invasive ones have really taken over. I don't care about banner ads that I see just once or ads on the side. The ones that infuriate me the most are those that obscure content, automatically play loud sounds/videos. Those that try to trick the user into installing something they don't obviously need, need to die in a fire. It's why I've installed Ghostery and use Mercury Reader to banish that bullshit to the depths of the internet hell. I'm also pleased that Google is being smart about this and blocking all invasive content...Even if it comes directly from their company because they need to be impartial and control these insanely bad adverts. Forcing a standard will hopefully make the internet a cleaner place, one that can support the advert model without being deliberately invasive or deceptive. Dragos Lucian The only thing that makes me use an adblocker on a lot of websites, is because, more often than not, you don't even need to click on the ads to be presented with a buttload of new tabs or individual pages. You just need to click on a blank area and boom ! You can barely make your way back to the page you initially were. If those type of ads go away, then I'll make sure to uninstall my adblocker. Till then, fuck everyone who posts those type of ads on their websites in order to gain revenue. Make your money off selling socks. Abhishek Mittal Does this mean my phone wont start buzzing and downloading unwanted apps without my permission? This is huge, a great step by google in improving quality of the internet Spinkick Does it bother anyone that google is the one that decides which ads are bad? abc Google means that they are going to block their competitors ads and only allow their own.

These are some of our favourites for when you've got five minutes or five hours to waste. Atari Breakout Image: Screenshot Run a Google image search for "Atari breakout" and you're met with a version of the classic game you can play in your browser. Use the cursor keys as controllers. The classic Google search page Point your browser at https://archive.google.com/heart to relive your youth with the classic Google search page. It still works, but the results page is the modern version. Are you feeling lucky? Click I'm Feeling Lucky on Google with nothing in the search bar and you're given a random Google link to try — it could be anything from mini puzzles to charity drives. Pac-Man Image: Screenshot Atari Breakout isn't the only game that gets a Google Easter Egg spin. The 2010 Google Doodle version of the classic title, Pac-Man, can be brought back with a simple Google search for "pac-man". Search box tricks Image: Screengrab Several Google searches give entertaining results. Some of our favourites? Try entering "do a barrel roll", "google in 1998", "askew", "<blink>", or "sonic the hedgehog." Search box tools These Eggs aren't really hidden surprises, more useful tools. You can run Google searches for "flip a coin" or "roll a die" to do just that, or use "timer" or "stopwatch" for those apps. Solitaire Image: Screenshot You're still after another game aren't you? Typing "solitaire" into Google gives you a web version of the classic card game. If you don't like cards, try entering "tic tac toe" instead. Bacon numbers Every movie star is less than six steps away from Kevin Bacon and Google can help you prove it — type the name of almost anyone followed by "bacon number" to get the link. Search in pirate or Klingon Google knows more languages than you might have realised: you can load up the search results page to display labels in pirate, Klingon or hacker speak, should you need to. The Loch Ness pegman Normally he's yellow. (Image: Screenshot) Search for "loch ness" on Google Maps and the iconic pegman figure turns into the shape of Scotland's most famous mythical (?) monster. No sightings of the actual Nessie, though. Use the Force, Luke Image: Screenshot The Star Wars scroll Easter Egg has come and gone from YouTube, but this one lives on — enter "use the Force, Luke" as a YouTube search to send the results into flux. Brush up on your trivia Knowledge is power and you can get more of it by searching for "fun facts" on Google. When you've absorbed the information, click Ask Another Question for a new fact. Endless dinosaur running If you find yourself without internet on your smartphone, pass the time by loading up Chrome for iOS or Android and tapping the dinosaur to launch an endless runner. Travel by dragon Image: Screenshot One for the Welsh here. If you choose to navigate from Snowdon to the Brecon Beacons and "dragon" appears as a travel option. Unfortunately, no dragons appear on screen. The Emmett Brown pegman You might have noticed this already, but when you view older imagery in Street View (via the drop-down menu in the top-left corner), the pegman turns into Emmett Brown. Cast spells on Android Call up the Google voice interface on Android via "OK Google" and you can cast a couple of Harry Potter spells: "lumos" to turn on the flashlight and "silencio" to mute all sounds.

Ongoing secrecy around the NBN, a project that’s likely to cost more than A$50 billion, makes it impossible for the public in most cases to know when and what quality service they will receive. Further, new research shows the NBN rollout was politically motivated and socioeconomically biased from the beginning. It is perhaps time to remind ourselves of the ups and downs of the project that was once announced as a dream national infrastructure project for the 21st century. This requires a ten-year journey back in time, before we can figure out what needs to be done next. Here Are 17 More 'Pirate' Sites Foxtel Is Banning In Australia Chris Jager 05 Jun 2017 12:15 PM Foxtel's legal crusade against online piracy has intensified, with the company applying to add 127 additional URLs to its proposed block list in Federal Court. The new sites under the ban hammer include YesMovies, Vumoo, LosMovies, CartoonHD, Project Free TV 1, Torlock and 1337x. Here is the full list. Want Lifehacker's email newsletter?

The course would eventually earn the name "Search Inside Yourself," attract thousands of Tan's coworkers, and spread across the globe. But back then, it was just a project that Tan pursued in his "20% time," or the time Google gives employees to pursue passions that are unrelated to their core responsibilities but that will benefit the company (whether employees still take advantage is up for debate). Tan recruited a bunch of big names in the space to develop and teach the course, including Norman Fischer, Daniel Goleman, Philippe Goldin, and Mirabai Bush. In those early days, Tan recalled when we spoke recently, they'd meet at Google's Mountain View headquarters and discuss their visions. "Halfway during one of the first meetings," Tan told me, "somebody asked: Is Google paying us for this? I was like, 'How would I know? Why are you asking me?'" (Tan clarified that Google did eventually pay the SIY instructors.) Tan's point here is that he didn't consult all the higher-ups and meticulously plan the logistics of SIY. He felt that, if he could get the program off the ground, it would benefit Googlers — and so he went for it. He explained: "The secret of my success in Google is to always do the right thing for Google and the world. And then I sit back and wait for them to fire me. So if they don't fire me, I've done the right thing for Google and the world. If they do fire me, then I'm in the wrong company. So either way I win." He went on: "This is one of those situations where I just do the right thing and then, if it doesn't work out, just ask for forgiveness." This advice won't work for everyone in every situation, Tan said. But at the time, it helped fuel his success. In 2008, he was offered a job in Google's people operations department so he could lead SIY full-time. After 15 years at Google, Tan retired in 2015. He said he wasn't sure what the culture is like today, but remembered that a lot of his coworkers "wanted to change the world. There was an element of idealism and energy and altruism."

The device starts at $700, and brings a nearly-bezel-less design, a build of high-quality ceramic and titanium, and a unique system for modular accessories.

The CFO discussed what she sees as the biggest threat to the dominant business, as well as progress on Fiber, X, and more. Nintendo Switch Porat cites “complacency and not innovating” as the biggest risk to the profitable core Google business, as well as not “investing substantially to continue to evolve what the user experience is and evolve the opportunities for advertisers.” YouTube received several mentions throughout the interview as a promising area, especially growing out the subscription business. The merger of Play Music and YouTube Music was referenced, while YouTube finds original content “really valuable.” Porat highlighted how the Google division is continuing to take an approach that values content creators and their followers. Overall, the YouTube community — as evident during I/O — is seen as very important, with most of Google’s social efforts focused there. Moving to the Other Bets, Porat reiterated that Google Fiber is taking a pause. We have pulled back. We looked at the approach we were taking. We said there’s got to be a better way through technology to meaningfully enhance both deployment and delivery. And we want to pause what we’re doing to see how much we can do with technology before we ramp what we’re doing again. Google’s original vision of laying out fiber didn’t end up making sense and the team with Larry Page’s help is looking at other technology. At the end of the day this isn’t going to be the transformative play that we believe. Let’s spend the time. And Larry’s spending a lot of time with the Fiber team on that. We brought in a great new leader from the industry. We’re excited about the work they are doing. So, that was a pause. X received a few mention, with Porat nothing that it “still exists” as “one of the other bets.” There’s “a lot of innovation and experimentation and moonshots going on within,” especially with robots: “We still have a lot of robotics work that we’re doing within X.” Watch the full interview below: Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

Opinion: Google+ isn’t dead, but it is drowning in spam (though it plans to do something about it) Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 10:20am PDTMay 29, 2017 160 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares300 Editorials Google Last month Gideon Rosenblatt did a post on Google+ about the very platform, and it resonated with us here at AP. Many of you may know that we have invested a lot of our time here into Google+. After all, this is Android Police, and Google+ is as much a product of Google as Android is. But, we’ve been disheartened recently by issues with the social network. Most notably, a growing problem with spam. Our own site founder and owner, Artem, spoke out recently about his problems with the platform in the wake of Rosenblatt's post. And his is just one of many posts which have been attracting more attention and discussion on the subject. All of this has even prompted a response from an engineering manager at Google, who says that it is going to make a greater effort to fix things in the future. But spam is just one symptom of the platform's problems. I can't talk about spam without talking about what causes it. Unfortunately, that means I need to beat a bit of a dead horse. A lot of the problems you've heard about the platform in the past are contributing factors. Spam is an indicator of health, and the often-discussed historical problems with Google+ are the diseases. So it might seem that I'm digressing onto a well-worn subject here, but it is important to the discussion. All the old problems From a development perspective, Google has been distancing its social platform from its other tools as much as it can. Photos and Hangouts were once both integral parts of the Google+ experience. But, much as each subsequent update to Google+ has removed or limited features, each year seems to take away integration with another Google service. Hangouts on Air, Google Photos, Shared Circles, location sharing, Google+ Local, with all these things gone it may almost be fair to say that Google+ may have seen more features removed from the service than it has in total at present. Although it was made a part of G Suite last year, it may be a bit too late, and the utility to businesses for the social platform is likely limited. By design or accident, ostracizing Google+ in this way may have resulted in stagnation. Isolation reduces the user count and the number of eyes on content. And that stagnation is a breeding pool for spam. Google’s advocacy for the social platform has also diminished. Many prominent Googlers, as well as people in the core Google+ team, are barely even using the service. If your own employees can’t be motivated to use your product — if not on merit, at least as a means of promoting it — then what sort of attention is being paid to it? Writing here at AP, when I embed social content from Google, it almost always comes from one of two places: Twitter or YouTube. Part of that is because Google posts more things to those platforms than it does to Google+, and that’s a problem. Consider the difference in content volume between the Google Photos Twitter, Google Photos Blog, and Google Photos Google+ account. The last one of those only saw four posts this year. So not only are Googlers not using the platform, Google also recognizes the lack of marketing value for its own self-promotion. And even those few posts made by official Google accounts have had issues with spam. Thankfully in light of the recent attention drawn to the subject, they've been mostly cleaned up. But, if Google's own content has problems with it, imagine what users face. And all the new ones All the other, well-discussed issues have not been enough to prevent Google+ from soldiering on as a niche network. It isn't Facebook (thankfully), or Twitter, but people use it. Adoption may have slowed, and utility might be diminished, but it has a user base. A surprising number of little communities have popped up inside it. Developers with Android apps have been using it as a platform for app communications, beta tests, and technical support. In the realm of Google related software development, the platform is a small but bustling community attached to the larger market. And the people there like it. At least, they like it when the signal to noise ratio remains high enough to drown out the spam. To be fair, one can't claim this is a problem exclusive to Google+. All social media platforms have problems with spam, it’s basically a rule. As the barriers to mass communication become lower on a given platform, the quantity of submitted content that is used for marketing purposes increases. It becomes a delicate balance. How easy can you make account creation before every account is a bot? How easy should comment removal or reporting be so that spam can be caught, but censorship isn’t abused? What sort of burden can be placed on users, and how much responsibility for policing content can be delegated? Given the widespread nature of spam on most high-profile Google+ posts, this particular balance may need some adjustment. Some of the recent changes to Google+ have also increased the proliferation of spam. A lot of the older functionality that made managing content easier was stripped out in the responsive redesign of 2015-2016. Although the new site is more performant and consumes much less data, it also has a lot fewer methods of user interaction with content. Every post view is now a click, and comments must either be scrolled or each post opened in a new window, both of which make reporting content that little bit harder. Increasing the number of barriers for finding and reporting spam makes each post its own little breeding ground. Even in a perfect world, nothing can ever entirely eliminate spam. Everyone has a Grandma selling Avon that doesn’t care how much people might dislike her relentless self-promotion on Facebook, or a cousin who is stuck in a pyramid scheme and blissfully unaware of his predicament. But more steps need to be taken by Google to decrease its presence. Unfortunately, that's much easier for us to say than it is for Google to do. What can be done? As GitHub previously needed a wake-up call for how to better treat things on a social level, Google might also need to reexamine a few things about how it wants to handle Google+ going forward. Just because the platform has become niche doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a future. For fans of Google’s services, developers on its platforms, and news outlets such as ourselves, the service has genuine utility left in it. To that end, Google has responded to the recent criticisms leveled at the service by promising to do things better going forward. And knowing Google, it will find a novel solution to the problem. But can the it be fixed by itself? Across two responses to the recent posts complaining about spam, Google+ engineer manager Leo Deegan stated that it was the number 1 issue to be addressed going forward. He also acknowledged that some of the interface changes in the redesign on Desktop made things more difficult, but changes are planned for the future. Some of their areas of focus going forward will include better spam control, enhanced community moderation, cleaner notifications, and better navigation. It might seem from the outside that change is occurring slowly, but a lot of work has been done updating things behind the scenes. He reaffirmed that Google is committed to the future of G+, as demonstrated by its inclusion as a core G Suite product, and was glad that the community was providing feedback about these concerns. Spam might just be an indicator that a platform is popular enough to be a target, but a number of the tools that could potentially be used to fight it aren't possible as a result of the other problems I mentioned. By ostracizing Google+, all Google does is ensure that the spam stays in a closed box. If more of Google's services made use of the platform, more eyes would be on its content, and more would likely be reported. With more eyes in Google+ the volume of spam might not change, but spam itself would be reported faster and more frequently. And by not using the service — either as individuals or professionally — Google further decreases the number of eyes on content. In reddit parlance: admins are asleep, post spam. But, imagine they never woke up. It's like an abandoned house covered with graffiti. If the landlord doesn't check in, and a lack of business keeps visitors from the area, all the people living in the neighborhood still have to put up with it. Unfortunately for Google, the cost for us to leave is 0. But fortunately for the neighbors, Google has promised to renovate soon. Tags Google Google Plus opinion spam subscribe ...

It was actually quite active for a while, and I hit about 80,000 followers. I followed hundreds of interesting people. Had thousands of great discussions. Then the spam started. We all complained to Google, but it was like talking to ourselves. After a while, I was spending most of my time on the service blocking spam, while all the people I followed gave up and left. I left about 6 months ago, as my feed slowly came to a halt due to the exodus. This is much the same sequence as all the social media sites that have come before. Great for a while, turns to crap, I move on. It was great while it lasted. If you're still finding G+ useful, more power to you. chromaniac The problem started when Google decided that they know what Google+ should be instead of what the users of the platform wanted it to be. I was part of the Google+ Help community and it was painful to see TCs and RSs repeating the same thing again and again every time a feature was killed or detached from the platform. In the last couple of months, there were one or two individual accounts that were posting updates. Most of which were teeny tiny enhancements or bug fixes that no one cared about. It's insane how badly they killed a solid platform with a small but dedicated user base. Of course, for a company the size of Google, a product needs to have a sizable user base which Google+ never attained. Too bad, instead of killing it like Google Reader, they keep on dragging it on and on and on insulting the remaining users/fans. bekifft And don't forget that they killed Google Reader specifically because it was seen as a threat to the growth of Google+. I'm still mad at them for that. bekifft There's no metaphor for Google+ as a baby, Google+ was more of a clone born out of a desperate fear of Facebook, combined with poor management. It was always a solution in search of a problem that only Google had and no one else saw as a problem. The start of Google+ and the reign of Larry Page perfectly coincide with the start of Google losing focus. It's been all downhill from there, from a user focus perspective. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Well stated. Cliff Wade Huge thanks to Ryne Hager for the mention and linking to my post. :) Ryne Hager Woo! Thanks for being cool with me doing it. First (real) op-ed. Cliff Wade @ryne_hager:disqus Any time man. Excellent article, but then again, it's written on AP, so you know it's going to be good! :) In all seriousness, really good article and a lot of good stuff was mentioned and discussed. I am a member of the G+ Early Access community, Google+ Create and Community Vanguards(got invited into the last two because of my post you linked to) and I can say there are quite a few things being worked on. One of which deals with spam but I can't elaborate unfortunately. It's just one small step towards what will be coming in the near future hopefully. Leo Deegan, Carter Gibson, LeAnne Osborne and others are very active on G+ and it's good to see things being discussed, both openly and in private communities about the future and updates to G+. I really feel there are some changes coming soon. Ryne Hager Good to hear! I am confident Google will be able to sort things out for the platform. yanick So many astrologers and this article is only opinion. Why didn't you asked them about G+ future? :-))) Ryne Hager Damn, I could have avoided writing this entirely. Next time.

Nick Coad Wooooosh abc Gee, you're an idiot. Mace Moneta Most of the people I followed on G+ starting leaving about a year ago due to the spam. I finally left about 6 months ago. Amazingly, Twitter was much better, though it obviously doesn't easily support long form content. So now, 18 months after the people I know started to leave, Google has decided to address the problem? Great. IainPurdie Gave up on G+ several months ago when they "updated" it. At that point, any posts I put up on my business page were "Me Only" and there was no way to change it. The page with the option to fix this was inaccessible. G+ became, essentially, useless. Plus, they never opened it up fully to allow third party apps to post to it as Twitter and FB have done, making it too much donkey work to use. Then there's the atrocious app that throws stuff from my feed at me in a worse, more random fashion than facebook. It's impossible to find a post you read two minutes ago. skeleton My girlfriend says she doesn't know how to work it, they need to make it more accessible to the average Joe.

Those spammers clearly target all android beginners and spam them with irrelevant ads. Come here and most economical public buses have exactly same such fake astrology ads all over... NeilR You can find spam anywhere in the world but at least those fake astrology ads are simple enough to be brushed off as most people as spam. NeilR Just because the author of the article linked a few screenshots of spam posts you assume most of the spam on Google+ comes from middle east and India. Nice. Any other sweeping generalizations you make? abc No.1 in spam!! 'Murica, fuck yeah! Ryne Hager You are right, the images are a bit too repetitive. Just to make it clear we didn't intend to single anyone out, I've changed a few of the images in the editorial. Vikas For me Google+ is just a tool to signup for beta or tech support of any app or product. chromaniac Google removed that requirement long time ago. Google+ Sign-in because Google Sign-in. Hamza Abass grateful permit easy access to my google+ account at any time. Vikas These Astrologer, Lost Lover and Champcash spammers can be found everywhere here in India. Carlos Eugênio Meanwhile many normal posts are being considered spam without the option or possibility to approve them in our communities. Schultzter I still say there's nothing new in Google+ that Google didn't already have in their existing products. Their effort would have been much better improving the products they had, keep them separate but make it easy to move from one to the other from within Google. There's no point trying to build a better Facebook now that everyone is already on Facebook. chromaniac The way Google f'ed it up after departure of Vic is astonishing. I finally deleted my account 2 weeks ago. I only miss following the posts of few folks who I believe only post on Google+. But the user experience had become so painful that it was time to say it goodbye. Unbelievable what Google did with it. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ It's not like you can just crack the social media market and become relevant at will, regardless of resources at your disposal. I can sort of imagine the reasons why Twitter got so popular, but don't think it would be easy to try to replicate it. YuCMi You're right, it also takes some awareness and a plan. Both of which Google never seemed to have. Stu I still use it but solely to perform the basic functions that Google Spaces did before Google stopped developing for it. aRvInD When many Googlers who write Android code still use iPhone as primary devices clearly says they themselves aren't interested much in their products... Harsh but truth..! Zsolt V Harsh but a lie. aRvInD Lie?? When why iPhone's Google apps often contain some new features before they get pushed to android beta users? Zsolt V Often? It happens very rarely and then it's because different teams work on different platforms. But what the fuck does that have anything to do with Google+? Or do you really think that the choice that person makes has any influence on the release schedule? At least at Google there is a choice. Can you imagine an Apple employee using a non-iPhone or non-Mac? Vantius Google+ in it's early days had a lot of interesting and new ideas to social media. The idea of putting people into groups based on interests and assigning audiences to posts based on those groups was a great idea. The idea of being able share live videos was a good idea too. It forced Facebook to adapt and improve it's own services. But, Google lost sight and IMHO started going downhill on the introduction of collections. it became obvious that they didn't know which way to take it. András Oláh I think Collections was a great idea but terrible implementation especially after the material design update. If it is a pain to manage your own collections and required 5+ clicks to set the collection you want to post to, no wonder no-one will use it. And the Collections landing page is even more terrible, there is zero visual indication whether a followed collection has any new content or not. I stopped following new collections because I felt that there is no point, as I will never see again those post in my stream. I stopped using more than 4 collections because of the inconvenient UI of switching collections. catalysto Sharing to collections is very easy. Sharing a photo to the G+ app, you can choose any collection or group you want right at the top. Metallinatus But.... did the black mage solve your problem? Ryne Hager 'course they did. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/495e00ef0755a130a47e98be9a9c81d1d83b992ccf87a3ab2b590f99a9c25400.gif Urmil Shroff I hope they do something about this, quickly. Peter Garlinski Maybe I'm one of the few, but Google+ works quite well and I've never encountered spam. Maybe it's because I've spent time with getting my circles setup with legitimate, decent people I want to get content from. With Facebook, I find it harder to really cut through the crap to talk to new people. Google+ makes it easier to do that. If Facebook ditched their awful feed concept, I would use it more, but right now Google+ is my go to platform. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ I'll second that never encountering much spam on Google+ part, at least compared to Facebook. I'm admin on a couple of user groups on Facebook and this week I had to ban at least 15 people for posting Malaysian child pornography videos..imagine. I mean I'd take astrology and sexy love any day over that despicable content. Timothy Vreeland I'll third it. I never see spam on G+. Where are the authors seeing it?

YuCMi No, because it's probably spam. YuCMi Google+ doesn't have any quality content in their trending page. At one point I wondered if it could emulate Reddit, but there's no -1 button or a way to block all the cringe teenager oriented communities. If only Google+ let their users decide what they want to see. Instead you have absolute garbage trending.

Just kidding😂 Lord Argyris That black magic specialist stuff seems to be the in thing for spammers these days. I've seen it several other places lately. Robin Hugli I use Google + a lot, not as social media but for all community for apps , beta apps community and all Android roms and development community or all popular tech news website etc , it's really good and quite active. But that's true,if a community for example become less active, like an app community that isn't updated often and the community become a bit dead , it become a spam place , many spam posts as the moderator isn't active. It's quite sad. What I suggested: on telegram, the owner of the chat can add administrators bots , that can detect spam or unsuitable post , automatically delete those posts , ban or warm people. That can be very useful on Google plus. Ryan Its really hard to care at this point. Google+ had some decent ideas around social but it was too late to the game so they "forced" people onto the platform by moving services that shouldn't have been there onto there. I only had G+ for photos and sharing location (when they stripped latitude from Google Maps). And both of those rolled out with LESS functionality as a part of G+ than they did prior. Right or wrong by being forced to use G+ to get them AND the stripped functionality it created a negative association with G+ for me. I was ready for G+ to die from day one and was glad when it did (died as in I can finally uninstall the app because Google isnt forcing me into it). That was the day that location sharing returned to where it should have been all along, Google Maps. Now I have to look forward to the failure of Allo/Duo so Google can return to a real all-in-one messaging platform like what Hangouts was becoming. Sadly it will probably be 3 years from now and nobody will care because they will be even farther behind than they already are. Fruity101079 I don't know if G+ is good or not, I never understand exactly how to navigate, explore, etc... Ui doesn't seem ergonomic, for me. Allen Martin G+ is actually a great platform in terms of what it offers and from a technology standpoint. It just doesn't have ubiquity, which makes it undesirable. And it's cool to make fun of the underdog. I actually use G+ as a news feed for tech news - and most tech news sites post to it regularly (even Android Police). If it ever goes away, I won't be upset but it would be cool if it realizes potential greater than what it is. derp_cookies I'm the owner of the C++ community on Google+ with just over 100,000 users. Spam is absolutely insane. Granted, they're pretty good at flagging spam, but I had to switch all posts to require moderation because it was so bad. My list of banned users is tens of thousands long. They definitely have a spam problem; maybe normal folks won't notice it, and it's more of an issue with communities? Also side note: Is it possible to read a headline somewhere about Google+ without the word "dead" in it? Kieron Quinn I'm an admin of the XDA community (unofficial, 188K members), we used to have loads of spam but it's dropped significantly recently. How many moderators do you have? derp_cookies About 4 at the moment. D.Smithee *crickets* abc Good. Can't wait for it to die. One less piece of Google bloatware on my phone. Gabby Now if we could only get the same examination of Disqus spam. Almost all of it looks so similar that their continuing failure to block it makes me suspect they are actually profiting from the spam somehow.

Several high-tech industry companies that have opposed the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement have pledged to continue their environmentally conscious efforts. Google CEO Sundar Pichai promised to stay the course in his tweeted response: Disappointed with today's decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all. — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 1, 2017 "Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk," wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. "For our part, we've committed that every new data center we build will be powered by 100% renewable energy," he added. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff tweeted a statement of his company's resolve to promote sustainability. Deeply disappointed by President's decision to withdraw from ParisAgreement. We will double our efforts to fight climate change. pic.twitter.com/cmCLf9CoVY — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) June 1, 2017 "Microsoft believes that climate change is an urgent issue that demands global action," President Brad Smith posted on LinkedIn. "We've sent letters to and held meetings on this topic with senior officials in the State Department and the White House." Apple CEO Tim Cook earlier this week urged President Trump to keep the U.S. in the agreement, he told employees in an email. Climate change is real, Cook said. Although disappointed with the pullout, he pledged to continue the company's environmental push. Why Trump Withdrew From the Paris Agreement Compliance with the terms of the agreement "could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025," including 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs, President Trump said, citing a study by National Economic Research Associates. By 2040, compliance would cut production for various sectors, costing close to US$3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, Trump said, based on the study's findings. Other studies, carried out not only by environmental organizations, but also by Citibank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have concluded that failure to curb climate change could cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars, according to a New York Times news analysis. The Paris Agreement "could legitimately be branded as an economic accord, given the potential financial impact on the countries that agreed to it," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. However, "given the impact on climate is both disputed and indirect, it likely would have been more accurate to call this an accord that's more directly focused on pollution, because the core measurements were tied to that," he told TechNewsWorld. The Paris Agreement "was more of a political vehicle and one that was long on promise but very short on actual content," Enderle said, adding that it lacks teeth to ensure compliance. It appears that Trump's decision this week has triggered a process that will continue into 2020, likely ensuring that climate change will be a significant issue during the next presidential election. Seeking a Brave New World The Trump administration will begin negotiations either to re-enter the Paris Agreement or to create a new one "on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its people, its taxpayers," the president said. However, France, Germany and Italy said in a joint statement that the Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated. "Overpopulation and the environment are issues that must be addressed now," said Jim McGregor, principal at Tirias Research. "If there's something awry with the current agreements, we need to address those issues, either with modifications to the agreement or a new one -- not just walk away," he told TechNewsWorld. "The U.S. should be the leader, not the anchor holding us back by not signing the accords," McGregor added. What High-Tech Companies Can Do "Any number of companies are acting consciously to improve their environmental impact," noted Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. For example, Dell EMC "has a variety of initiatives," he told TechNewsWorld, including "using recycled materials in their packaging ... and an initiative to recycle plastics floating in the ocean." Still, many tech companies "talk the talk but don't walk the walk when it comes to the environment," Tirias' McGregor pointed out. The fact that both supporters and opponents of environmental issues "know much of what they're saying isn't true, makes positive change almost impossible to accomplish," Enderle said. The tech industry "is all about data and accuracy," he remarked, and it "could use these tools to cut through the dishonesty and help those that truly want to make change."

Kelkoo claims Google has crippled its business by illegally exploiting its monopoly over internet searches, and is seeking damages that could run to millions of pounds. It comes as the European Commission prepares to hit Google with a fine expected to run into the billions in the coming weeks. Brussels regulators have been investigating Google for seven years, and claim it has taken advantage of its 90pc share of European internet searches to unfairly promote its own price comparison service, which automatically checks across internet retailers to find online shoppers the best deal. Google has completely destroyed most of the industry. They set about systematically destroying the likes of KelkooRichard Stables, Kelkoo chief executive Searching Google for “cheap televisions” will prominently display the search engine’s own service, putting rival comparison services like Kelkoo at a disadvantage. Kelkoo’s High Court case was filed in December 2015 but is expected to come to the fore in the coming months. The Commission is expected to rule against Google and fine the company in June or July, before its summer recess. Kelkoo was once one of Europe’s highest-profile internet companies and was sold to Yahoo for €475m (£415m) in 2004. After it was bought by British private equity group Jamplant for less than €100m in 2008, Google began to promote its own price comparison service. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is investigating Google Credit: EPA Richard Stables, its chief executive, said Kelkoo’s traffic from Google had dropped by around 95pc in the last few years. “Google has completely destroyed most of the industry. They set about systematically destroying the likes of Kelkoo,” Mr Stables said. He did not comment on how much Kelkoo was seeking, but said industry-wide damages claims could run into the billions. Google did not comment. Last year the company won a High Court battle over somewhat similar claims that it had promoted its own maps over those from a rival, Streetmap, although unlike price comparison, maps were not a focus of a European Commission investigation. Kelkoo's revenues have fallen from €103m (£90m) in 2005 to €38.4m in 2015.

In an ironic twist, Google has beaten Amazon to Canada when it comes to smart assistants — the Echo still isn’t available in the country, despite being available for two years in the US. The Google Home will cost $179 in Canada, right on par with US pricing when you consider the ongoing devaluation of the Canadian dollar. Google hasn’t given a release date for the speaker yet, but Best Buy’s preorder page says the device will be available on June 26th; Google says two to three weeks. Either way, Canadians should finally be able to yell at an inanimate object like their American neighbors within a few weeks. The Google Home speaker will be available to purchase from Google, Best Buy, and other retail partners.

Alexa now supports reminders and named timers Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 10:28am PDTJun 3, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares154 News It has been a little over 200 days since the Google Home was officially released, and owners are still waiting on Google to implement support for reminders. Perhaps in response to the growing competition, Amazon has been hard at work improving Alexa, and has now added reminders and named timers to the assistant. The reminders work pretty much as you would expect - asking "remind me to take out the trash Sunday night" will prompt your Alexa-powered device to notify you when the time comes. The named timers can be created with phrases like, "Set an oven timer for 10 minutes." Amazon only explicitly mentioned the Echo in the announcement, so it's possible these features are limited to Amazon's own devices for now and could require a software update for others (I don't have an Alexa device to test). It also seems to be limited to the United States at the time of writing, for some reason. Tags alexa amazon assistant named timers reminders timers subscribe ...

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Alexa, set guitar reminder for one minute" -- it just gives you an alarm. "Alexa, set reminder for one minute" - Alexa says, "What's the reminder for?" I say, "Guitar". 1 minute later, "Here's your reminder -- guitar." MrCalifornia Can't say I like having to give two inputs every single time. I only use multiple timers like 2% of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Then just say "Alexa, set timer for 1 minute". However, I have a feeling this just a matter of there's no pleasing some people. Especially Google fanboys.

According to cyber security firm Check Point, dozens of malicious apps were downloaded between 4.5 million to 18.5 million times from the Play Store. Some of the malware-affected apps have been discovered residing on the online store for several years. “Judy” is only one example of how an open and free mobile operating system (OS) can be exploited by malicious app developers. Most security flaws we hear about now affect old versions of the OS or require clever social engineering to get the user to weaken device security, technology website extremetech.com reported. New versions secure The versions of Android being released now are more secure than what Google was putting out years ago and as a result no one has managed to claim Google’s largest bug bounties for Android. Hoping to attract more researchers and engineers to the bug bounty programme, the company has increased the rewards to up to $200,000. Google started the bug bounty programme for Android about two years ago in which the security researchers, who can find a flaw, get a cash prize — the amount of which varies based on the severity of the hack. Then, Google gets to fix the bug and avoid future security issues. Still, no one has submitted a working exploit for Android’s core components, even when such an exploit is worth $30,000—$50,000, the report said.

It’s all about Josephine Baker, a world-famous entertainer known for her famous banana costume and activism.  » RELATED: Google honors famous African American female sculptor with doodle The search engine site, which sometimes uses its homepage to honor prominent figures, is highlighting the dancer on what would have been her 111th birthday.  Born Freda Josephine McDonald in 1906, Baker grew up in poverty in St. Louis but gravitated towards the arts at a young age. As a girl, she toured with the Jones Family Band and Dixie Steppers and later joined the musical “Shuffle Along” as a teen in New York. Her fame as a jazz musician grew after she renounced her U.S. citizenship and uprooted to Paris in the 1920s. The French vedette appeared on stages across the globe, but one of the most memorable ones featured her in a banana skirt with bedazzled jewels strewn across her neck. Baker was an actress, too. She landed roles in French films including “Princesse Tam Tam” and “Moulin Rouge.” She was the first person of African descent to become a global artist and to star in a major motion picture. Despite her fame, she did not have a warm homecoming when she returned to America in the 1950s. At least 36 hotels refused to serve her. She was so appalled by the treatment that she only performed for integrated audiences and began travelling the South, speaking and writing about the racism in the states. »RELATED: Google honors Native American activist with doodle She eventually befriended Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks and worked closely with the NAACP. When King was assassinated, his widow Coretta Scott King asked her to be the new leader of Civil Rights Movement. After some thought, she declined the offer, because she wanted to protect her children. In 1975, she died from a cerebral hemorrhage four days after starring in a comeback show to celebrate her 50 years in the business. Since her death, she has been portrayed by several singers, such as Diana Ross and Beyonce, and inducted into Hall of Fames across the United States. Now, Google is paying tribute.  "It's almost impossible to sum up such a multi-faceted figure, which is why today's Doodle is in a slideshow format highlighting several of Baker's most impactful accomplishments," doodle designer Lydia Nichols told Refinery29. "The bold, limited palette and simple aesthetic were influenced by poster art of the 1920s and 30s when Baker broke onto the scene." Check out the doodle archive to see Baker’s animated doodle. »RELATED: Who was Gilbert Baker? Google honors rainbow flag creator with doodle Related J.K.

He got to the byline and pulled the ball back to the edge of the six-yard box, where Cristiano Ronaldo had made his run and was on hand to slot the ball past Buffon.

His luck was in - the shot took a wicked deflection off Sami Khedira and crept in by the far post.

Whether he did that off his own bat or under instruction from his manager is open to debate. Having said all that, he did open the scoring tonight, but has had little impact so far.

A product called “Google Attribution” was unveiled at a marketing conference this month. Google has long been able to determine when users click on ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Google senior vice president Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working. “Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels,” Ramaswamy said. “Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey — from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase.” Real-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide “a complete view” of marketing performance, according to the company. Using artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better analyze and understand consumer behavior to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference. For several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Ramaswamy noted. “Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation,” Ramaswamy said. “You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business.” Real-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handed in “a secure and privacy-safe way,” with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymized forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company. Tying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a “holy grail” for advertisers for quite some time, and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenant of privacy, that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with, Stanley contended. “This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals,” Stanley said. “Each step raises the question ‘Where does this all stop?’” Stanley expected Google to be on its best behavior when it came to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the “enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive.” “We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so,” Stanley said “It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections.” Google and Facebook dominate the online ad world, and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, according to Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. Attribution promised to give Google a way to assure advertisers they are getting their money’s worth at the firm’s online venues. “The big problem is that showing conversion from ad consumption to purchase has been horrible,” Enderle said of online marketing. “This has been a problem for a long time. Google is trying to make a metric so they get credit for it when you do purchase after viewing an ad.” Data showing which ads are translating into real sales should mean that the relevance of ads people see online will improve as marketers abandon mis-aimed or ineffectively tailored messages, the analyst reasoned. “You are going to be hit with ads for things that you might actually want to buy, so you are going to spend a lot more money,” Enderle predicted. Worries about privacy sparked by linking offline and online activities are a decade or so late, because the time to protest was when collection began of troves of data about people.

I will use a Google Apps script called Twitter Merge to send personalized DMs in bulk. This Google Apps script allows you to use mail merge feature on Twitter right from Google Sheets. You can configure a template with variables which allow you to personalize it as per your requirements, and after that, you can send that template either as a personalized message or tweets to your followers. Read the complete tutorial to know how exactly you can do it. Sponsored Links How to use mail merge on Twitter: Basically, all you have to do is make a copy of Twitter Merge Google Sheet and then use it to send bulk direct messages and tweets. To send personalized DMs, you have to create a template. This template can contain variables and these variables should exist in the Google Sheet. These variables are then replaced by the values from its Google Sheet column which makes it personalized for every Twitter follower. So, the only major task involved in this method to write a template for your mass DM which in fact is really easy. I will explain how you can write the template in the steps below. Step 1: Make a copy of Tweet Merge from here. After that, you will see the Tweet Merge sheet as shown in the screenshot below. Before, moving forward, make sure you have added all of your Twitter followers to this sheet. You have to specify Twitter screen name of your followers in the “Twitter User” column of the Google Sheet. This can be quite a tedious task if you have a large number of following. Fortunately, there is a method to export Twitter followers to Excel. After that, you can copy and paste your Twitter followers from the downloaded Excel file to “Twitter User” column of the Google Sheets. Step 2: Now, you have to first authorize this Google Apps script to access your Twitter profile. Click on the “Twitter Merge” menu which appears right next to the Help menu at the top and select “Authorize Twitter” option. Step 3: In this step, I will explain how you can configure personalized tweets or direct messages to your Twitter followers. You have to write a template and after that, you can choose whether you want to send it as a public tweet or as a DM to your followers. Click on the Twitter Merge menu at the top and select the second option i.e. “Configure Tweets”. This will open a dialog box in which you can write the template to do mail merge on Twitter. You can simply write a message in the template and include variables in it to personalize. The variables are to be enclosed in curly braces like this “{{variable_name}}”. The only thing you have to take care is that variables in the template are in your Google Sheet. So, before writing the template you need to figure out what variables are in your DM. In my case, I wanted to send a simple DM “Hello Twitter User, check out ilovefreesoftware.com” to all of my Twitter followers. Here, “Twitter User” is the variable involved. By default, the Twitter User column was already there in the Google Sheets. So, I just specified my followers in that column. What Twitter Merge did, in the end, is that it replaced the “Twitter User” variable in the template with the username of the Twitter handles of my followers which I specified in the “Twitter User” variable. Let’s say you have a different variable then you have to create a column in the Google Sheet with the variable name and then enter the data. So, in this way, you can define variables in the template and add data in the Google Sheet to personalize it. At last, select the type of the template i.e. whether it is to be sent as a public tweet or direct message from the drop-down list below the text area, as shown in the screenshot above. To do mail merge, select “Send Direct Message” option. Step 3: After you have written a template, you can then send it as a public tweet or DM to your followers. All you have to do is select the “Send Tweets” option from the “Twitter Merge” menu. It then prompts whether you want to send the tweets or direct messages. Allow it, and you can see the progress in a small dialog box at the bottom-right of the Google Sheets. As soon as it finished sending personalized DMs to my Twitter followers, I checked it on my Twitter profile to see if it worked or not. As expected, it sent the DMs exactly in the same template, as you can see a screenshot of my Twitter DMs below.  Verdict: In this tutorial, I explained a simple method to use mail merge on Twitter. Using the method in the tutorial, you can send simple to complex personalized bulk DMs to your followers. Make a copy of Twitter Merge.

The versions of Android being released now are more secure than what Google was putting out years ago and as a result no one has managed to claim Google’s largest bug bounties for Android. Hoping to attract more researchers and engineers to the bug bounty programme, the company has increased the rewards to up to $2,00,000.Google started the bug bounty programme for Android about two years ago in which the security researchers, who demonstrate an exploit, get a cash prize — the amount of which varies based on the severity of the hack. Then, Google gets to fix the bug and avoid future security issues. Still, no one has submitted a working exploit for Android’s core components, even when such an exploit is worth $30,000-$50,000, the report said.     More Related News Nest security camera knows who’s home with Google face tech Apple WWDC 2017: Siri speaker is coming, to take on Google Home, Amazon Echo For all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App Tags: Android Google No Comments.

Homepage Sign in / Sign up Chris DixonBlockedUnblockFollowFollowing www.cdixon.org/about Jun 1 Crypto Tokens: A Breakthrough in Open Network Design It is a wonderful accident of history that the internet and web were created as open platforms that anyone — users, developers, organizations — could access equally. Among other things, this allowed independent developers to build products that quickly gained widespread adoption. Google started in a Menlo Park garage and Facebook started in a Harvard dorm room. They competed on a level playing field because they were built on decentralized networks governed by open protocols. Today, tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple are stronger than ever, whether measured by market cap, share of top mobile apps, or pretty much any other common measure. Big 4 tech companies dominate smartphone apps (source); while their market caps continue to rise (source) These companies also control massive proprietary developer platforms. The dominant operating systems — iOS and Android — charge 30% payment fees and exert heavy influence over app distribution. The dominant social networks tightly restrict access, hindering the ability of third-party developers to scale. Startups and independent developers are increasingly competing from a disadvantaged position. A potential way to reverse this trend are crypto tokens — a new way to design open networks that arose from the cryptocurrency movement that began with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008 and accelerated with the introduction of Ethereum in 2014. Tokens are a breakthrough in open network design that enable: 1) the creation of open, decentralized networks that combine the best architectural properties of open and proprietary networks, and 2) new ways to incentivize open network participants, including users, developers, investors, and service providers. By enabling the development of new open networks, tokens could help reverse the centralization of the internet, thereby keeping it accessible, vibrant and fair, and resulting in greater innovation. Crypto tokens: unbundling Bitcoin Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 with the publication of Satoshi Nakamoto’s landmark paper that proposed a novel, decentralized payment system built on an underlying technology now known as a blockchain. Most fans of Bitcoin (including me) mistakenly thought Bitcoin was solely a breakthrough in financial technology. (It was easy to make this mistake: Nakamoto himself called it a “p2p payment system.”) 2009: Satoshi Nakamoto’s forum post announcing Bitcoin In retrospect, Bitcoin was really two innovations: 1) a store of value for people who wanted an alternative to the existing financial system, and 2) a new way to develop open networks. Tokens unbundle the latter innovation from the former, providing a general method for designing and growing open networks. Networks — computing networks, developer platforms, marketplaces, social networks, etc — have always been a powerful part of the promise of the internet. Tens of thousands of networks have been incubated by developers and entrepreneurs, yet only a very small percentage of those have survived, and most of those were owned and controlled by private companies. The current state of the art of network development is very crude. It often involves raising money (venture capital is a common source of funding) and then spending it on paid marketing and other channels to overcome the “bootstrap problem” — the problem that networks tend to only become useful when they reach a critical mass of users. In the rare cases where networks succeed, the financial returns tend to accrue to the relatively small number of people who own equity in the network. Tokens offer a better way. Ethereum, introduced in 2014 and launched in 2015, was the first major non-Bitcoin token network. The lead developer, Vitalik Buterin, had previously tried to create smart contract languages on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Eventually he realized that (by design, mostly) Bitcoin was too limited, so a new approach was needed. 2014: Vitalik Buterin’s forum post announcing Ethereum Ethereum is a network that allows developers to run “smart contracts” — snippets of code submitted by developers that are executed by a distributed network of computers. Ethereum has a corresponding token called Ether that can be purchased, either to hold for financial purposes or to use by purchasing computing power (known as “gas”) on the network. Tokens are also given out to “miners” which are the computers on the decentralized network that execute smart contract code (you can think of miners as playing the role of cloud hosting services like AWS). Third-party developers can write their own applications that live on the network, and can charge Ether to generate revenue. Ethereum is inspiring a new wave of token networks. (It also provided a simple way for new token networks to launch on top of the Ethereum network, using a standard known as ERC20). Developers are building token networks for a wide range of use cases, including distributed computing platforms, prediction and financial markets, incentivized content creation networks, and attention and advertising networks. Many more networks will be invented and launched in the coming months and years. Below I walk through the two main benefits of the token model, the first architectural and the second involving incentives. Tokens enable the management and financing of open services Proponents of open systems never had an effective way to manage and fund operating services, leading to a significant architectural disadvantage compared to their proprietary counterparts. This was particularly evident during the last internet mega-battle between open and closed networks: the social wars of the late 2000s. As Alexis Madrigal recently wrote, back in 2007 it looked like open networks would dominate going forward: In 2007, the web people were triumphant. Sure, the dot-com boom had busted, but empires were being built out of the remnant swivel chairs and fiber optic cables and unemployed developers. Web 2.0 was not just a temporal description, but an ethos. The web would be open. A myriad of services would be built, communicating through APIs, to provide the overall internet experience. But with the launch of the iPhone and the rise of smartphones, proprietary networks quickly won out: As that world-historical explosion began, a platform war came with it. The Open Web lost out quickly and decisively. By 2013, Americans spent about as much of their time on their phones looking at Facebook as they did the whole rest of the open web. Why did open social protocols get so decisively defeated by proprietary social networks? The rise of smartphones was only part of the story. Some open protocols — like email and the web — survived the transition to the mobile era. Open protocols relating to social networks were high quality and abundant (e.g. RSS, FOAF, XFN, OpenID). What the open side lacked was a mechanism for encapsulating software, databases, and protocols together into easy-to-use services. For example, in 2007, Wired magazine ran an article in which they tried to create their own social network using open tools: For the last couple of weeks, Wired News tried to roll its own Facebook using free web tools and widgets. We came close, but we ultimately failed. We were able to recreate maybe 90 percent of Facebook’s functionality, but not the most important part — a way to link people and declare the nature of the relationship. Some developers proposed solving this problem by creating a database of social graphs run by a non-profit organization: Establish a non-profit and open source software (with copyrights held by the non-profit) which collects, merges, and redistributes the graphs from all other social network sites into one global aggregated graph. This is then made available to other sites (or users) via both public APIs (for small/casual users) and downloadable data dumps, with an update stream / APIs, to get iterative updates to the graph (for larger users). These open schemes required widespread coordination among standards bodies, server operators, app developers, and sponsoring organizations to mimic the functionality that proprietary services could provide all by themselves. As a result, proprietary services were able to create better user experiences and iterate much faster. This led to faster growth, which in turn led to greater investment and revenue, which then fed back into product development and further growth. Thus began a flywheel that drove the meteoric rise of proprietary social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Had the token model for network development existed back in 2007, the playing field would have been much more level. First, tokens provide a way not only to define a protocol, but to fund the operating expenses required to host it as a service. Bitcoin and Ethereum have tens of thousands of servers around the world (“miners”) that run their networks. They cover the hosting costs with built-in mechanisms that automatically distribute token rewards to computers on the network (“mining rewards”). There are over 20,000 Ethereum nodes around the world (source) Second, tokens provide a model for creating shared computing resources (including databases, compute, and file storage) while keeping the control of those resources decentralized (and without requiring an organization to maintain them). This is the blockchain technology that has been talked about so much. Blockchains would have allowed shared social graphs to be stored on a decentralized network. It would have been easy for the Wired author to create an open social network using the tools available today. Tokens align incentives among network participants Some of the fiercest battles in tech are between complements. There were, for example, hundreds of startups that tried to build businesses on the APIs of social networks only to have the terms change later on, forcing them to pivot or shut down. Microsoft’s battles with complements like Netscape and Intuit are legendary. Battles within ecosystems are so common and drain so much energy that business books are full of frameworks for how one company can squeeze profits from adjacent businesses (e.g. Porter’s five forces model). Token networks remove this friction by aligning network participants to work together toward a common goal— the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This alignment is one of the main reasons Bitcoin continues to defy skeptics and flourish, even while new token networks like Ethereum have grown along side it. Moreover, well-designed token networks include an efficient mechanism to incentivize network participants to overcome the bootstrap problem that bedevils traditional network development. For example, Steemit is a decentralized Reddit-like token network that makes payments to users who post and upvote articles. When Steemit launched last year, the community was pleasantly surprised when they made their first significant payout to users. Tokens help overcome the bootstrap problem by adding financial utility when application utility is low This in turn led to the appreciation of Steemit tokens, which increased future payouts, leading to a virtuous cycle where more users led to more investment, and vice versa. Steemit is still a beta project and has since had mixed results, but was an interesting experiment in how to generalize the mutually reinforcing interaction between users and investors that Bitcoin and Ethereum first demonstrated. A lot of attention has been paid to token pre-sales (so-called “ICOs”), but they are just one of multiple ways in which the token model innovates on network incentives. A well-designed token network carefully manages the distribution of tokens across all five groups of network participants (users, core developers, third-party developers, investors, service providers) to maximize the growth of the network. One way to think about the token model is to imagine if the internet and web hadn’t been funded by governments and universities, but instead by a company that raised money by selling off domain names. People could buy domain names either to use them or as an investment (collectively, domain names are worth tens of billions of dollars today). Similarly, domain names could have been given out as rewards to service providers who agreed to run hosting services, and to third-party developers who supported the network. This would have provided an alternative way to finance and accelerate the development of the internet while also aligning the incentives of the various network participants. The open network movement The cryptocurrency movement is the spiritual heir to previous open computing movements, including the open source software movement led most visibly by Linux, and the open information movement led most visibly by Wikipedia. 1991: Linus Torvalds’ forum post announcing Linux; 2001: the first Wikipedia page Both of these movements were once niche and controversial. Today Linux is the dominant worldwide operating system, and Wikipedia is the most popular informational website in the world. Crypto tokens are currently niche and controversial. If present trends continue, they will soon be seen as a breakthrough in the design and development of open networks, combining the societal benefits of open protocols with the financial and architectural benefits of proprietary networks. They are also an extremely promising development for those hoping to keep the internet accessible to entrepreneurs, developers, and other independent creators.

Google search data show which states search the most for information on student aid. by Robert Kelchen June 2, 2017 2:13 PM Higher Education Donate Subscribe Share Tweet Print Email In advance of this week’s National Spelling Bee finals, Google released data on the word that people located in each state searched “how to spell” on a regular basis. (Kudos to South Dakota for being so interested in how to spell “college!”) I used the Google Trends tool to search for how often people in each state searched for information on the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) over the last five years and one year, as well as how often they searched for the “FASFA”—a pronunciation that is like fingernails on the chalkboard for many folks in higher education. Between 2012 and 2016, interest in both the FAFSA (in blue) and the FASFA (in red) followed a pretty typical pattern, as shown in the first graph below. Searches picked up in frequency on January 1 (the first day to file for the new application year) before peaking around March 1 (when many state aid deadlines occur) and falling off dramatically in September. But in the 2016-17 application cycle (the second graph), searches spiked near October 1 (the new first date for filing the FAFSA) with a smaller peak around January 1 and an equal peak around March 1. This shows how the early FAFSA changes did reach students and their families. Note: The “FAFSA” is in blue and the “FASFA” is in red. I also looked at search intensity by state over the last year, with the most intense state receiving a value of 100. Mississippi had the highest intensity of FAFSA searches, while Oregon’s value of 42 was less than half of Mississippi’s value. Louisiana and Arkansas tied for the highest FASFA value (30), while Minnesota (7) had the lowest value. Looking at FAFSA-to-FASFA search ratios (a proxy for how commonly people searched for the wrong term), Louisiana had the lowest ratio of 3.07—indicating the highest frequency of incorrect searches. Meanwhile, Minnesotans were the least likely to type “FASFA” relative to “FAFSA,” with a ratio of 10. FAFSA and FASFA search intensity, May 31, 2016 to May 31, 2017.

From the Salon Archives: Google Street View's debut prompts warnings about privacy and the future of surveillance Farhad Manjoo Skip to Comments Topics: Google, Google Street View, partner video, Salon Archives, technology, Innovation News This story Salon story was originally published as "Google is watching you (but so is everyone else)" on June 1, 2007. Let’s say that one bright afternoon a few weeks ago you decided, as one does, “Hey, let me pop into the adult bookstore.” There’s one right down the street from you, after all, 367 12th Street in downtown Oakland, a humble little place that goes by the unprepossessing name Adult Book Store. You didn’t want to make a show of it, obviously; you kind of ambled inside, hands behind your back, looking but not looking, your gait suggesting confidence and sophistication. And you would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren’t for those nosy geeks down in Mountain View: Of all the sin joints in all the towns in all world, you had to walk into the one that, at that very second, was being trailed by a VW Beetle pimped out with an 11-lens digital camera that was taking in everything it saw, and posting it all to Google’s servers. Now there you are on Google Maps, memorialized in your moment of weakness, and the whole Web — even Matt Drudge! — is laughing at your accursed luck. Such is life in a time of Google Street View. Earlier this week, Google Maps debuted a system that offers 360-degree snapshots of thousands of addresses in five cities across the country (San Francisco, New York, Denver, Las Vegas and Miami). The service might come in handy next time you wonder if a certain new restaurant in an out-of-the-way part of town is a hole in a wall, but so far Street View seems to have raised more alarm than acclaim. Google acquired the pictures by contracting with a firm called Immersive Media, which drove camera-equipped cars all around town, capturing not only streets but also everything that happens on and around streets — people walking (and jaywalking), people loitering, people shopping, people picking their noses, people jogging, people driving cars, and even people hanging around porn stores and strip clubs. Now the Web’s atwitter with recriminations. A woman writing in to Boing Boing reported feeling “the shakes” when she discovered that Google’s camera saw right into her apartment. Wired’s Threat Level blog is compiling a brimming album of pictures of folks caught in not-for-the-whole-world-to-see situations, including one of a man who looks like he’s breaking into an apartment building, and another of women sunbathing at Stanford. No one is more exercised than Drudge, who led with the Google story for much of Thursday, linking to several unfortunate Street Views under a banner headline — SMILE, YOU’RE ON GOOGLE EARTH! — that nicely distills the overarching fear the project generates: “Could Google have caught me doing something I wouldn’t want plastered on the Web?” Indeed, Google very well might have, and privacy advocates aren’t happy. On Wednesday, Kevin Bankston, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNET that it’s “irresponsible for Google to debut a product like this without also debuting technological measures that would obscure the identities of people photographed by this product.” Google, in response, pointed out that its cameras had only caught what was in clear view; its images were “no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street,” a spokeswoman told CNET. This sounds like a reasonable position. I live just around the corner from San Francisco’s historic Painted Ladies, and every time I walk out of my house my image is likely getting sucked into someone’s SD Card and uploaded, without my knowledge, to Flickr. It would be unreasonable for me to get upset when this happens; I shouldn’t expect my actions to be private, after all, when I’m in a public place where people have a First Amendment right to document what’s going on. If you think about it, is Google acting any differently from trigger-happy Japanese businessmen on a first trip to Manhattan? When I talked to Bankston about the plan on Thursday, he acknowledged that Google’s project highlights the tension between free speech and the right to privacy — a balance that has never been cut-and-dried, but that is growing increasingly uneasy now that “comprehensive surveillance is no longer something out of science fiction.” Bankston doesn’t believe Google’s effort violates the law. “I think they have a First amendment right to document the public spaces we share,” he says. Rather, Bankston thinks the project is unethical. Unlike people who post pictures of street scenes to Flickr, Google’s plan operates on an enormous scale, and it’s completely automated, meaning that it exercises no human judgment over what should and shouldn’t be put online. When Google indexes the Web, it follows every Web site’s Robot Exclusion Protocol, a machine-readable file that webmasters draw up to tell search engines what should and shouldn’t be included in search. There is no Robot Exclusion Protocol for the real world. Google allows people to report pictures that should be taken down from Street View, but by the time you learn that there’s a shot of you going into an A.A. meeting, an abortion clinic or attending a political protest — well, by then the damage may already have been done. Bankston admits that it would probably have been quite difficult, if not impossible, for Google to have blurred out the people it captured in its street pictures. But he notes that if anyone has the collective brainpower to do that, it’s them. Yet even if Google does someday implement a way to cut people out of its street scenes, Street View is simply another reminder of what we’re inevitably going to lose in a time of easy recording and distribution of images and other documents: anonymity. Nothing you do is hidden anymore, and while we can argue about whether or not this is a salutary thing — Bankston argues persuasively that anonymity serves an essential social function; (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous) — keeping things secret, now, might just be impossible. Let’s come back again to that shot of you walking into the adult bookstore. Panning around the scene, we see a woman window-shopping nearby, and across the street a bus is unloading its passengers. There are several cars, too, moving down the street. If you’re ever contemplating visiting such an establishment again, it might be wise to operate on the assumption that all these people are packing cameras. Already, weirdos like Justin.tv are stalking our streets, broadcasting all they encounter; is it really fantastical to think that in five or 10 years’ time, everyone might be recording everything? Likely not. Watch out. Farhad Manjoo is a Salon staff writer and the author of True Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society. More Farhad Manjoo.

Wait in the wings while all of the other companies fuck up while trying to innovate, and then, just when it seems almost too late, introduce a product that does the same thing as everybody else’s product, but better. This is bound to be true with the rumored Siri speaker. The idea is oddly exciting. It’s widely believed that, on Monday, Apple will reveal this so-called Siri speaker. The voice-controlled device is supposed to be a lot like the Amazon Echo or the Google Home, except, you know, it’s an Apple product. That means it will look great, work great, and cost a great sum of money. According to rumors, that also means that the gadget will lack some of the flashy features of seen in the current contenders on the market. The Siri speaker probably won’t have a touchscreen, like the new Amazon Echo Show. It probably won’t have a built-in wi-fi router, like the rumored Google Home hardware update. Your Move, Apple It feels like it’s 2001. Tons of companies had released tons of MP3 players, and they all sucked.…Read more That’s kind of the point, though. Apple is famous for releasing first generation products that do just enough, really well. Just think about the original iPod, which celebrates its sweet 16 this year. The market was flooded with problematic MP3 players by the time Steve Jobs announced Apple’s magical solution in October 2001. Jobs himself explained how companies small and large were trying and failing to build music players. Advertisement “They haven’t found the recipe,” Jobs said at that event, moments before revealing the iPod. “No one has really found the recipe yet for digital music.” Now get ready for the good shit. “And we think,” Jobs continued, “not only can we find the recipe, but we think the Apple brand is going to be fantastic, because people trust the Apple brand to get their great digital electronics from.” You can just imagine those exact same words coming out of Tim Cook’s mouth on Monday to describe Apple’s entry into the smart speaker market. Lots of companies, large and small, have tried to sell an internet-connected, voice-controlled speaker for the home. None of them are awesome. Amazon’s had the most success with Echo, largely because it was the first mega tech company to introduce a viable option. Echo gained steam as a smart home hub, too, because Amazon let virtually any company develop the capability to work with Alexa, Amazon’s half-decent, artificially intelligent assistant. And despite its relative dominance in the information space, Google’s smart speaker, blandly named “Home,” has struggled to take a bite out of Amazon’s market share. So here comes Apple. If the Cupertino kids do announce a new piece of hardware at the WWDC conference this year, it will almost certainly be some sort of smart speaker. People are calling it the “Siri speaker,” because such a device would use Siri’s computer brain power to respond to voice commands and questions. We can also expect an upgrade to Siri, perhaps a new version that can distinguish between different voices and maintain multiple user profiles. (Google Home already does this, and Amazon is expected to release the feature soon.) Otherwise, the Siri speaker will probably do the same things as the Home and the Echo—only, hopefully, better. After all, Apple is increasingly admitting that it’s a luxury brand. For a smart speaker, that would mean that the sound quality would far surpass the tin-can tones of an Echo. Some rumors claim that Apple actually wants to take on Sonos in offering high-quality wireless audio throughout the home with exceptional acoustics and the processing power of an iPhone 6. Meanwhile, we have to expect Apple to flex its dominance in the privacy and security spheres. As too many people clutch their pearls over the idea of an Echo recording all of their conversations, the market is definitely primed for a safe-seeming smart speaker. It will also—Jony Ive voice—be an extraordinarily beautiful object. A design porn shot from an iPad Pro promotional video (Image: YouTube) But this all begs the question: who’s going to buy this new Apple object? It’s not immediately obvious that people need a smart speaker in the same way that they needed a smartphone when Apple released the iPhone ten years ago. Then again, nobody needed a smartwatch when the Apple Watch came out and now it’s the number one product in the category. Is it because the Apple Watch is the very best wearable computer? Who knows. Do people trust the Apple brand to build great digital electronics? A lot of them do, yes. Even more powerful than that, however, is the fact that a lot people will buy a new gadget simply because Apple made it. Call them fanboys or girls or whatever you want, but Apple loyalists are fucking loyal. Advertisement Sponsored Steve Jobs programmed them to be. From the early Mac days, the late visionary excelled at convincing people that electronics were their friends. After all, way back in 1984, the original Macintosh computer gave its own robotic but revolutionary introduction speech. “I’d like to let Macintosh speak for itself,” Job said, and the computer did. The crowd went wild. We don’t know what will happen at WWDC 2017. If Apple does announce a smart speaker, maybe Tim Cook will invite Siri will make the announcement herself (itself?). There’s a good chance the device won’t be available until the fall, a move that would echo Google’s announcing the Home last spring for a fall release. Of course, Apple might also let us all down and announce some boring new iPad update or no new hardware at all. Advertisement But if Apple does decide to join the smart speaker circus, the company will almost certainly do it as Steve Jobs would’ve wanted. The gadget will be simple. It will be beautiful. It will work. It will sort of suck, but that’s why you have to stick around to buy the second generation—and the third and the fourth until infinity.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Internet Google Chrome to block all adverts on websites that annoy users with intrusive pop-ups Google's ad blocker will allow ads as long as websites follow industry-created guidelines. By Associated Press Updated June 3, 2017 18:12 BST Google's ad blocker will allow ads as long as websites follow industry-created guidelinesLeon Neal/AFP/Getty Images Websites that run annoying ads such as pop-ups may find all ads blocked by Google's Chrome browser starting next year. The digital-ad giant's announcement comes as hundreds of millions of internet users have already installed ad blockers on their desktop computers and phones to combat ads that track them and make browsing sites difficult. These blockers threaten websites that rely on digital ads for revenue. Google's version will allow ads as long as websites follow industry-created guidelines and minimize certain types of ads that consumers really hate. That includes pop-up ads, huge ads that don't go away when visitors scroll down a page and video ads that start playing automatically with the sound on. Google says the feature will be turned on by default, and users can turn it off. It'll work on both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Google says that even ads it sells will be blocked on websites that don't get rid of annoying types of ads. But there might not be vast changes online triggered by the popular browser's efforts. It's a "small number of websites that are disproportionately responsible for annoying user experiences," Google spokeswoman Suzanne Blackburn said. "I'm sure there are some publishers who will get hurt," said Brian Wieser, an ad analyst with Pivotal Research Group. But in the long term, he says, cracking down on irritating ads should make the internet experience better, encouraging people to visit sites and click on links. That, in turn, benefits Google. The company is also starting a program that could help publishers deal with users who have downloaded popular ad blockers. Some individual websites have come up with their own countermeasures. Forbes.com, for example, won't let you read stories without disabling your ad blocker or logging in with Facebook or Google accounts, so the site can track you. Google would work with websites to set up messages telling users to disable their blockers for the site or pay for a version of it with no ads. It'll take a 10 percent cut of those payments. To protect its ad business, Google has tried to improve user experiences in other ways. It launched a way for websites to load faster on phones. And it used its sway as the dominant search engine to push companies to make their sites mobile-friendly. Such sites show up higher in mobile searches. Google also has tried to address advertisers' concerns about their ads running next to offensive content by banning its ads from some objectionable videos on YouTube, like those that promote discrimination or advocate illegal drug use. Google also won't place its ads on web pages with objectionable content — porn, for example, and or sites that promote suicide or violence. Facebook, too, is trying to make links from inside its universe less spammy for users. It says it's trying to cut down on posts and ads in the news feed that lead to junky pages with "little substantive content" and "disruptive, shocking or malicious ads."

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 130 Plus 1 on G+ 337 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares551 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues. Darshan Jain I am facing the same bootloop issue and my phones warranty has expired and Huawei and Google refused to help Shailla Chand My phone will be fresh off the charger at 100% and shut down within 15 minutes. Talk about frustrating.. Gerbil My 6p has been losing power at alarming rate always with Android system and Android OS at the top. Then it began randomly shutting down an demanding to be charged after sending a notification my battery hit 0% when I was well above 40% and failed to detect my SIM card for about 3 hours. I down own a power bank so I'm really suffering here as my phone dies midday and I can't use it for the latter half of the day. chesterbr Now that you mention... I (a no-bootloop-but-frequent-shutdown-at-30% Nexus 6P user) had a couple failures on SIM card detection. Not sure how long they lasted, removing and reinserting seemed to have done the trick... keeps one wondering... :-/ rpeltz My Nexus 6p shuts down when the battery drops below 49 percent. This can happen in as little as an hour of idle time and the phone is just over 1 year old. Cassy Forrester I had the shut off issue. It was shutting off at 99% after a couple of weeks of only shutting off at 48% and below. Still ridiculous. Anyway, I bought it through Newegg so I had to deal with huawei.. biggest fucking pain in the ass. We waited 22 days for a shipping label. Called on a thursday and they said by Monday it would be emailed. Still didn't come. Called again and they said another few days. Didn't come. Called AGAIN and after 5 hours of being on the phone (that day alone.. 15 hours total), they sent the email with the label. I sent it in and like 4 business days later it was returned.. same phone I sent it.. doesn't shut off anymore.. BUT they told us it was a software issue and that they couldn't fix the phone so they would have to replace it. Clearly they didn't replace it but it doesn't shut off so that's good right? Well no. Now my phone is not charging if I use it while it's on the charger... Also, I get the warning when it boots that it can't be checked for corruption. Fuck these people. Fuck this phone. My warranty was up by the time they sent the label but they did say they are taking phone's after warranty because they are having so many issues with this phone.. (also why they took so long to help me) Well no wonder they're taking them! They are only half ass fixing them. So if a half ass fix is worth it to you, call them. They might help. This is the US in case that helps. iRulLezZ My 6p shutted down with full battery and restarted all the time ! Nothing happes ! Pghgeek My 6p has the issue. Powers off before battery is low. Won't tun back on until connect to a charger then shows 40 to 60% battery. Have to use another phone. Don Smith My 6p purchased 11/2015 has been the most fantastic phone i've ever had but hey. Now i noticed that i never get the battery saver time. Then i researched. my phone is shutting down at 56% batter. Of course there is no warning that this is coming. So it's only useful if i'm plugged in at home, the car or traveling with my anker battery pack, Thank you anker. My exeperience with trying the warranty once is that it's worse than worthless. Details for file a clain, time passes then a letter that your claim is denied. Seems rediculous. Better to know you don't have warranty than wast your money only to be frustrated. I'm ready to give up on android and an unreliable beta company. but add me to the list of sabotaged 6p lovers. Kelly Kay Mine shuts down at 25% without fail. Robert Hynes I still have the shutdown issue....anywhere from 60 to 20%. Unlikely I will get a pixel or other Google device unless there is a fix. Maybe we just need a more high profile device like a Samsung in order to get noticed. Jeffrey Huston I started experiencing this for the first time on my Nexus 6p shortly after installing Android 7.1.2. It can happen anywhere from 20% to even 60%, and happens multiple times daily. I've had the phone for probably a year and am generally always on the latest Android version. I don't think it started immediately; might have started a week after installing 7.1.2. I initially blamed an app or a Google play services update, but I've been factory resetting my phone three times now, each time reinstalling and updating fewer and fewer things to see if it would stop happening. It hasn't stopped yet. My next step was going to be factory resetting and doing zero app installs and updates (then it's basically just a phone, gross), but then I stumbled on this article. Now I'll probably skip that next factory reset and see if Google will send me a new phone. Hans Breda I contacted Google Support about this issue. They were very cooperative and are sending me a replacement! Hope this will solve the problem. chesterbr I did not have the bootloop, but phone would shutdown anywhere below 30%. After reading some experiences here I got my battery replaced at a local shop (Mobile Klinik in Toronto, CAD$ 60 plus tax, service done in 1-hour, no data loss or anything), and the problem is GONE: phone goes down to 1% at a steady pace. Normal usage gives me an entire day, just like it did when I purchased it. I'll be sad if a class action lawsuit earns something (not for the money, but for the principle), but it seems it will give my phone at least another year of life (heck, possibly more, this phone is a beast). But I'll hardly ever buy Google (or Huawei) again - this is not how you handle such issues. Michael Magdy My Nexus 6p stuck on google screen.. And the shutdown and repeat again.. Noone could solve this till now.. Even the two companies google and huwaei don't respond or tell where is the problem I went to a software programmer.. He could do nothing also It's now just a piece of metal I need help Kishor Padghan My Nexus 6p experienced early shut down 2 times so far despite having enough battery. It can be restarted only after battery is fully discharge and charging the phone. My phone has been unreliable now, it can ditch me any time. RJ Southam Mine started this weekend, I got a whopping 19 months out of my phone, however it still boots eventually just not sure for how much longer... Elizabeth Warner I basically keep a charger with me all the time and plug in in the car, at the office, at home... Very inconsistent, sometimes shuts down showing orange, but today was shutting down and showed as being at 28%. I've been uninstalling apps that I don't use, have a battery monitor so that I don't over charge...

Google Photos will now suggest photos to archive Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 3:44pm PDTJun 2, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 50 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares134 Applications News Google Photos has become a very convenient way to back up all your photos... all of them. Even all the receipts, addresses, and other junk. Google recently added archiving to get that stuff out of the main timeline, but now it's going a step further by suggesting photos to archive. It sounds like the feature we spotted in a recent APK Teardown. The suggestions will appear as a card in the Assistant tab inside Photos. Google will use its machine learning magic to figure out what's in the photo, marking potentially unimportant ones for archiving. You then have the chance to evaluate the selections before proceeding, so you won't accidentally sweep up any important pics. New! See suggestions for photos to archive, so you can move photos you don’t want to see in your main library. See ya later, receipts 👋 pic.twitter.com/RpjBquGN5G — Google Photos (@googlephotos) June 2, 2017 Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. All the images you archive will remain in albums and search results. They're just more out of the way. This feature is still rolling out, so give it time. Manual archiving is already available, though. Tags apps Google google+ photos photos subscribe ...

Mine is automatically turned on when I just checked it right now. needa Nothing for me. DP2 XL needa I have thousands duplicate type photos. I seriously hope it advises me to archive all of them. I have been waiting for Google to do something like this for a while now. Maybe if I can get rid of all the clutter, I can stick stuff in albums and clean it all up. Mustafa Selçuk Öztürk I got the update and it shows under Assistant Cards, but no suggestion yet. Waiting patiently... myssi it must be processing your photos brkshr This archiving feature is a godsend!!! My wedding and my honeymoon tour of 7 national parks takes up at least a third of the photo's I have saved from the past 15 years or so. I already archived about half of my wedding photo's. Now I just need to get through the metric ton of honeymoon photo's I have of nature and driving and it will be much easier to find the important photo's. Dennis Ulijn It's also important to solve this problem from the other end: start realizing which photos matter to you. Nature pictures? Architectural pictures? Portraits, group pictures? Nature and architecture are abundant, I just try to shoot the people I'm with, mostly spontaneously or without the knowing because I want to capture the moment. I don't have to archive many photos, and I do take a lot of pictures of my kids. abc Some people like nature more than people. :) Besides, the easiest solution is not take any pics at all because someone else in the group will do it and share them with you. Dennis Ulijn I doubt my toddlers will take a good picture ;-) well, to each their own. Sometimes avoiding the problem is simpler than solving it. Lourdesdcruz Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Facts Cool feature Erstam I wish they would adopt a folder and sub folder like structure. I would still much rather organize my photos that way. It suggested i archive all my screen shots. Meh. Rudder2 JunkMail I agree with you. I hate Google Photos' organization and use Google Drive instead because I like organizing my photos with folders and subfolders. Another beef with Google Photos is it doesn't recognize my Google Drive Photo folders as albums. Google has a lot to learn how people like to organize photos. The Google Drive help line tried to get me to switch to Google Photos and I gave him an ear load. I spend hours organizing my photos on my computer and Google just doesn't care and wants us to do it again in their app. Anon They need to let us archive entire folders automatically, like the whatsapp image folder Vlad > Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. No it's not. This is EXACTLY how it works in Gmail and how I count on it to work. Everything is still categorised, it's just not there when opening gmail.com Cakefish This is completely unrelated to the article but I'm getting very impatient waiting for Motorola and Nokia to reveal their 2017 phones. Do you have any news on release dates for us AP? DynamikD I'm glad about this feature. Great way to hide photos that you may not want to people to view. I don't quite understand why people still complain about not being able to create folders though. It's an archaic way of doing things. That's why you can create albums within photos. Serves the same function but it leverages meta data which is more efficient and makes searching for photos and videos easier within the app. Yuri Vidal if google photos would only give me the option to NOT BACKUP my screenshots... i hate it! (Samsung stores screenshots under /DCIM/Screenshots so, google photos thinks they are pictures and uploads them. There is no way to unselect this folder, since it is a subfolder of the pitures folder... PLEASE FIX THIS! Ozl This is just great! i have a lot of files being uploaded on wifi from whatsapp and some i forget to delete, and others are just there just in case, so yes, Thanks Google! Fruity101079 I thought this archive function was useless, and it is for me, but when i see your comments, i guess i was wrong. It seems to be useful to a lot of you who didn't take time to organize and arrange your photos.

Google confirms that Chrome will integrate an ad blocker in 2018 by Wayne Manion  3:30 PM on June 2, 2017 A little over a month ago, the internet started buzzing with rumors that Google would bake ad-blocking right into its Chrome browser. A new post on Google's blog, written by the company's Senior VP of Ads & Commerce Sridhar Ramaswamy, confirms that selective ad-blocking is coming to Chrome early next year. Most websites, including ours, are funded at least in part through advertising. Some sites also use more intrusive ads than others. Intrusive ads include auto-playing audio, videos with sound, countdown timers, and pop-ups—among many other variants. Google believes these intrusive ads cause users to install ad-blocking software. Therefore, the company believes that if the obnoxious ads are eliminated, users won't go to the Chrome Store for the latest across-the-board ad-blocking browser add-on. To this end, Google joined the Coalition for Better Ads, a body that also includes Facebook and Reuters, among other organizations. Ramaswamy says the company "plan(s) to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018." Put simply, all ads on pages containing any non-compliant advertising will be blocked by Chrome's built-in ad blocker. Whether this move will actually result in the desired effect is something to be seen. The post also announced Funding Choices, a new program that extends the company's earlier Contributor service. Sites that choose to participate in Funding Choices can display a personalized message to users of ad-blocking software and offer them a choice to enable ads for the site or make microtransaction-like per-page payments through the user's Google Contributor pass.

Josephine Baker Google Doodle honors Jazz Age icon & highlights her civil rights work Born on this date in 1906, Baker was one of the most photographed women of her time. Amy Gesenhues on June 3, 2017 at 7:55 am More Google traded out its homepage logo today to celebrate Jazz Age icon performer, civil rights activist and French spy Josephine Baker. Born on this date 111 years ago, Baker reached international fame by the 1920s. A star of the stage, her singing and dancing won her a role as part of the chorus line in “Shuffle Along,” the first all-black Broadway musical. After moving to Europe, Baker’s celebrity status skyrocketed. “She set off for Paris and found her fame and artistic home in the city’s opulent cabarets, singing and performing uninhibited dance routines that celebrated female liberation and African cultural identity,” reports the Google doodle team. Baker was one of the most photographed women on the planet during her lifetime. She was also a committed fighter for civil rights, refusing to perform for segregated audiences and working to advance the NAACP efforts. Google also notes Baker’s time with the French Resistance during World War II when she worked on the sly, “hobknobbing” with Axis officials at high-profile events to collect intelligence during the war, “…often writing it on her sheet music in invisible ink.” After the war Charles de Gaulle awarded Baker the Croix de Guerre and inducted her into France’s Legion of Honour. Google’s doodle honoring the performer leads to a search for “Josephine Baker” and is designed as a slide show, featuring a variety of images highlighting different stages of her life: Google is sharing the doodle on its U.S. homepage, along with a number of its international homepages, including France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Canada.

We are celebrating the St. Louis-born Creole Goddess with this tribute. Baker, who’s illustrated in today’s Google Doodle. Google says, “With her kohl-rimmed eyes and exotic costumes, Josephine Baker pounced onto the global stage in the 1920s, becoming a Jazz Age icon and one of the first internationally recognized African-American entertainers. A celebrity in Europe — and one of the most photographed women on the planet — Baker nonetheless faced racially charged comments from the press when she returned to the U.S. in 1936 for a short-lived starring turn in the Broadway series Ziegfeld Follies. Championing diversity and fighting for civil rights would become an enduring concern throughout her life. …There’s little doubt why Ernest Hemingway once called her “the most sensational woman anybody ever saw — or ever will.” Here’s why Baker was a boss in her heyday: She fought for diversity and inclusion: An avid activist, when she visited the US, she demanded to stay at the best hotels and play to integrated audiences. She possessed keen a business ability: The Roaring 1920’s star 12 adopted children (10 boys and two girls), the “rainbow tribe,” who were natives of various countries including Japan, Belgium, Algeria, Argentina, Colombia, Finland, France, Israel (though questionable), Morocco, Ivory Coast and Venezuela. The multiracial, multinational family were an attraction based on their unique reality. All dressed in white, Baker charged admission to tourists who came to hear them sing, to tour their home, or to watch them play leapfrog in their garden. They appeared in print advertisements and were interviewed by the press. She would have broken the internet first if she did it for the ‘Gram: In 1926, the biracial beauty was a sex symbol and when she performed her danse sauvage, bent over in her infamous banana skirt, practically nude, during a revue at the Folies-Bergère in Paris, the audience went wild. She owned real estate in the South of France: Baker bought a Renaissance castle in Périgord, the Château des Milandes, with more than 30 rooms, on 1,000 acres, which boasted a motel, a bakery, cafés, a jazz club, a miniature golf course, and a wax museum. A restaurant is named in her honor in New York on Broadway (Times Square): Ideally located on West 42nd Street along Theatre Row, Chez Josephine is a magnet for dining before or after the theater. They serve French cuisine. It was started by her “13th child,” Jean-Claude Baker. Her name and legend live on: Baker is the subject of many books including Josephine Baker and the Rainbow Tribe by Matthew Pratt Guterl and a biography by Jean-Claude Baker titled, Josephine: The Hungry Heart.

Happy 10th birthday, Google Street View! Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/31 7:54am PDTMay 31, 2017 7 Plus 1 on G+ 32 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares83 Google News Videos It's hard to believe, but Google's Street View is officially 10 years old. What started out as a goofy little side project (like many of Google's most interesting products) has now managed to image numerous countries in every continent on the planet. The Google Maps add-on has even managed to gain a new lease of life with respect to virtual reality, and has proven popular as an educational tool taking learners all around the world on tours to places they might never get to see with their own eyes. Google co-founder Larry Page had the initial idea to create a 360-degree image map of the entire world. This would be his solution to the problem of teleportation, to go anywhere in the world at any time. Street View now offers that virtual capability to anyone with a smartphone or a computer. What started out as research at Stanford was picked up Google in 2004. A group of Googlers used their 20 percent time to affix some high-tech cameras and other sensors onto a van and drive it around San Francisco capturing images. This was the first Street View car. After a couple of years, they'd perfected the technology of stitching together the footage to create a continuous image of a street or other terrain, and the car was shrunk down quite a bit too. By 2007, 10 years ago, they were ready to publish their creation, and Street View has gone from strength to strength ever since. "Ten years later, we’ve published imagery on every continent, in 83 countries, and traveled about 10 million miles with the Street View car. Talk about a roadtrip." When the goal is to image the entire planet, at some point you're going to have to go where cars can't. The team's answer to that problem was the Trekker, a wearable Street View camera that could be worn as a backpack and taken anywhere a human could go. It's been used to capture many of the wonders of the world and has even proven useful to conservation organizations seeking to better observe wildlife in its natural habitat with minimal disturbance. Since 2013 Trekker cameras have been loaned out around the globe, speeding up the rate of image capture by using the local expertise of many volunteers. Just last month Google announced the next step for the project when it introduced 20 new Street View ready 360-degree cameras that will be available to the public. While this won't exactly be affordable for everyone, the intrepid (and rich) among you will now be able to buy a Street View camera of your own and go out to fill in some of the gaps that Google hasn't yet got to. I'm sure many would relish the opportunity to get involved and contribute to what has been an incredible global project. So, happy 10th birthday, Street View. Here's to the future, and wherever those stunning images will take us next. Source: The Keyword Tags 360-degree camera AR Google google maps street view video VR subscribe ...

What they actually mean is this: In fact, the fly ash emitted by a power plant—a by-product from burning coal for electricity—carries into the surrounding environment 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant producing the same amount of energy. Note that they aren’t comparing anything to “nuclear waste” here. Not to underplay the fact that fly ash contains radioactive elements, here is the key info: McBride and his co-authors estimated that individuals living near coal-fired installations are exposed to a maximum of 1.9 millirems of fly ash radiation yearly. To put these numbers in perspective, the average person encounters 360 millirems of annual “background radiation” from natural and man-made sources, including substances in Earth’s crust, cosmic rays, residue from nuclear tests and smoke detectors. IOW, you get an extra 1/2% radiation dose from the fly ash, which is more than the extra dose what you get from a superbly-run nuclear power plant that emits virtually nothing, or having a bad banana habit. But no mention of all the unintended emissions that do occur, the leaks, the waste itself that hasn’t been dealt with, emissions from uranium mining, fuel rod processing, not to mention the occasional melt down. With nuclear it’s always what happens when things go wrong that you need to worry about. This is propaganda from the nuclear industry, pure and simple. SciAm is beyond a joke. Reply ↓ MoiAussie June 2, 2017 at 7:47 am And, the article is 10 years old. Reply ↓ Roger Smith June 2, 2017 at 7:52 am This headline immediately turned me away, Thank you for the details. Reply ↓ vlade June 2, 2017 at 8:00 am Well, the problem (having lived both near a nuclear reactor and a polluting coal station) is that the coal station pollutes day in, day out, and no-one pays attention. When something like Fukushima/Chernobyl happens, people in the vicinity know they are screwed bad time pretty much immediately. I’m willing to bet that coal and diesel emissions killed, in the same time, much more people than Fukushima/Chernobyl and both atomic bombs combined. IIRC, that (combined nuclear deaths) add up to about 300, call it 400k. The UK estimates that particulate polution (of which diesel is main cultprit, but coal until it was banned for domestic pusposes, and filters forced on commercial ones was too) kills about 28-29k people/year in the UK alone. Reply ↓ Skip Intro June 2, 2017 at 2:23 pm Ok course the nuclear waste from these plants will keep killing for over 100,000 years. Reply ↓ UserFriendly June 3, 2017 at 1:44 am How many have died so far? It’s a bad headline but it’s very true that you are safer living next to a nuclear reactor than a coal plant. Reply ↓ Mac na Michomhairle June 3, 2017 at 8:43 am I don’t know about coal burning plants, but the population in my county living in a rural area near a nuclear plant has remarkably elevated levels of cancers among children and teens. Can it be proved that the cause is the ongoing release over thirty years of radioactivity? Of course not, so we are healthier living next to a nuclear plant than a coal burning plant. Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive June 2, 2017 at 8:28 am +100 Scientific American should be embarrassed! Obviously, sensationalism is more important to them than science these days….. The last disclaimer says it all: “As a general clarification, ounce for ounce, coal ash released from a power plant delivers more radiation than nuclear waste shielded via water or dry cask storage.” Reply ↓ Roger Smith June 2, 2017 at 8:33 am Science has become a brand. No one even expects actual understanding of knowledge anymore. They just snidely retort, “what, you don’t believe in science??” or “It’s science man”. That is right, it is so obvious I should just nod my head in agreement. Reply ↓ Brian June 2, 2017 at 10:26 am It has been advertised as a brand for some time now, and melded with politics to form a stream of misinformation by manipulators. But not to scientists. When you use the scientific method to solve a problem, opinion is not involved after you have selected your experiment. The manipulation happens after you reach a conclusion, which is immediately attacked for its political ramifications. Just think religion and science, flat earth, etc. Science is plagued by non scientists. Reply ↓ Greg Taylor June 2, 2017 at 12:00 pm Selection of metrics and experimental design trade-offs involve subjectivity and opinion. This allows experiments to be manipulated for a variety of purposes before any data is collected. Too often, scientists are intellectually captured by those funding their experiments and design in ways that ensure the results will please their paymasters.

One thing they neglected to consider that should be sending off alarm bells is that people can breathe in fly ash. They accounted for exposure to crops around coal plants and the resulting radiation intake from eating those crops, but not a word about radiation in your lungs. Neither method is safe without proper engineering that cuts into profits.

Part of this involved checking a couple of very long and complex conversations (threads) on a forum called physics forum. Primarily from those readings, but also from reading any and all articles online related to Fukushima, I became very aware of how much mis- and disinformation regarding the dangers of radioactivity is being disseminated. The “coal is more radioactive than uranium/plutonium” argument is very common, probably beating out the “bananas are radioactive” one. Both are, as has just been pointed out, specious. The crucial difference between internal and external exposure is consistently ignored or misrepresented. In the forum threads, the engineers and “science guys” for lack of a better term were just as consistent in disregarding both the non-quantifiable and the non-scientists they were usually in disagreement with (except of course the non-scientists with no scientific sense at all, i.e. the “go live in a cave then” types). One (user name “nuceng” so I’m going to assume from this cohort) was continually disparaging other people posting comments, when I pointed this out I was banned permanently. I’d seen enough by that time, concluding that honest debate with the true believers was impossible. The term is apt because the temper as much as the content of the pro/anti nuke debate has revealed to me that nuclear power has a quasi-religious status in many quarters of the science/tech community, no doubt related to the more widespread worship in “developed countries” of the latest shibboleth, Progress With a Capital(ist) P. Nuke power is at the crux of this belief–it’s a quintessentially capitalist enterprise, and it offers the addictive opium of perceived command and control over both hi-tech wizardry and the most dangerous materials on earth. The import of the fact that those materials have been underground for 100s of millions or billions of years (where a greater wisdom seems to believe they should remain) seems to escape their understanding. Reply ↓ davidgmills June 3, 2017 at 1:33 am People are clueless about radioactivity. You included. Truth is we are probably going to need nuclear power at some point. But I don’t bother engaging on political or financial blogs because it is a religion for people who know absolutely nothing about radioactivity. If you think radioactivity is going to kill us all, then don’t ever consider going to the hospital to have an Xray or CT scan, much less radiation treatment. The people I trust on the issues of radioactivity and health? Radiology oncologists. Get the scoop from them. Reply ↓ JoeK June 3, 2017 at 3:07 am @davidgmills I myself generally only “engage” with thoughtful, logically coherent comments in reference to something I’ve posted, but it’s hard not to respond to yours as it’s such a wholesale misrepresentation of my post, complete with straw-man exaggerations and self-contradiction (beginning with your “engaging” despite not bothering to do so). The only possible way you could draw the conclusion I’m “clueless” about radioactivity from my short set of comments is to have misread them completely, or to have made excessive inferences based on your personal prejudices; though I could do so, I’ve no inclination to elaborate beyond pointing at the coal or banana comments as possible sources for this attempt at insight or analysis on your part. The second paragraph: are X-rays harmless after all, I missed the news, and x-ray foot measuring for shoes is about to make a comeback? Seriously, didn’t you read the part in my comment about “go back to your cave” comments? Exactly what you’re doing here, sounding like a no-sense-of-science guy. Last, having dealt with more than one cancer patient getting radiation treatment, I’ve seen “the scoop” up close and personal, thank you very much. An oncologist’s opinion on radiation, aside from being that yes it kills cells, is going to depend much more on his attitudes and beliefs than hard science. I expect that too will confound you.

Interesting how my comments get twisted into something I didn’t say, and I think it’s quite clear I didn’t. The tuo quoque argument–if you don’t think technology X is benign than go live in a cave–was referred to, but I guess I should have been more explicit. Same re uranium and other radioactive rocks being underground. It’s only one way to look at it, to be sure, one could also say that since we didn’t evolve with built-in lead shields or the equivalent, which we would have had we evolved in the presence of radioactive rocks, and since they are thus extremely hazardous, lethally so, we should–if we are compelled to make use of them, keep ourselves protected from their lethality. Using this stuff to boil water is, even from this more nuke-friendly framing, reckless. Building a nuclear reactor takes huge amounts of capital. Guess how one describes a capital-intensive process. The centralization of power, both literal and figurative, is another important factor. And the close connection to the military’s use of radioactive materials, both for power production and in weapons. Etc, etc, etc. As to the last, how many people X has killed vs. nuclear, this is one I’m well familiar with, and would consider debating, but your example is so ill-considered I fear my responding would eventually lead down a rabbit hole of misrepresentations and sloppy debate. BTDT, don’t any more. Reply ↓ UserFriendly June 3, 2017 at 7:29 am Yes, meltdowns cause lots of excess radiation. So does the sun. So do nuclear bombs. How many nuclear warheads do you think have been detonated? Just between 1945 and 1990 there were over 2000 ‘tests’. Tell me why I should worry about a comparatively miniscule amount of radiation leaking from one poorly built plant when the world was dropping hundreds of bombs each year for decades with no noticeable (unintended) effects. The problem I have with you anti nuclear people is you have no sense of scale. You are on the same level as the GOP who has been whipped into anti islamic stances by the news making everyone think there are terrorists everywhere when you are more likely to slip and die in your bathtub than get killed by a terrorist. A nuclear plant that was designed in the 70’s (so it didn’t have computers to help with the calculations) ran just fine for years until a Tsunami hit it. Some radiation spilt, yes it was unfortunate. How many people died? 0. How many countries are now going to close down nuclear plants in favor of CO2 emitting ones? WAY TOO MANY. You have no sense of scale. We don’t have any wiggle room with CO2. We are on track to turn bangladesh (with 4x the population of California) into Atlantis by the end of the century and that is the best case scenario. We only get one shot at this and you people that jump whenever the news says BOO are killing lots of innocent people. There is litteraly no way to create enough wind and PV in time because they have such a high EROI. There have been lots of improvements in the design of nuclear plants, they have been made fail safe in some tests. The biggest hurdle is the public ignorantly thinking that all nuclear is the same and it is all very likely to explode and kill them with things they can’t see. This planet and the people on it are not worth saving I am so sick of everyones selfishness, arrogance, and ignorance. Reply ↓ MoiAussie June 3, 2017 at 1:41 pm I understand exactly where you are coming from, but you lose any credibility by arguing that Yes, meltdowns cause lots of excess radiation. So does the sun. The radiation from nuclear meltdowns and the radiation from the sun are completely different in energy. Sure, heatstroke can kill, as can skin cancers, but it ain’t radiation poisoning. Sunscreen is cheap. As for Fukushima, the meltdown caused 300,000 people to be forced to evacuate to avoid deaths from radiation. And that evacuation led directly to about 1600 deaths: Fukushima evacuation has killed more than earthquake and tsunami, survey says Thousands died promptly or prematurely as a result of Chernobyl. Just because deaths due to radiation exposure are statistical rather than deterministic doesn’t diminish the danger of nuclear accidents. Even if we were to accept the risks of nuclear accidents and hope for the best, nuclear energy is not cost-competitive. Nuclear works by an accounting trick that pushes massive costs into the distant future. Only by completely ignoring the fantastic costs of cleanups, waste management, and decommissioning does nuclear make economic sense. Few plants have been decommissioned to greenfield status, and even less waste has been dealt with. Current cleanup cost estimate for Fukushima is $190B USD, double what it was 2 years ago, and it will continue to grow. That figure alone is about 6 times what it would cost to build and run a 2GW plant for 40 years. Reply ↓ UserFriendly June 3, 2017 at 4:28 pm Valid point about the evacuation deaths. As far as nuclear waste goes if there wasn’t so much public paranoia, that makes not only the permitting but the fundraising too, next to impossible we would have molten salt reactors that run on nuclear waste, are fail safe, run at atmospheric pressure, and generate electricity for a fraction of the cost. This older article spells out the hurdles rather well. https://www.technologyreview.com/s/512321/safer-nuclear-power-at-half-the-price/ And here is a more recent update. https://www.fastcompany.com/3043099/this-nuclear-reactor-eats-nuclear-waste And no I have no ties to any nuclear companie and their are several other startups with worse publicists working on the same type of reactor. I would love to get rid of every nuclear plant we have up now because they are so horribly inefficient and comparatively unsafe. But trust me, CO2 is a much, much bigger threat to the entire species than a handful of suboptimal nuclear plants even if we had 1 meltdown a year.

My assumption is that property damage only crashes are more likely in local or stop and go kinds of driving situations. The injury and fatality crashes are perhaps more representative of higher speed situations (freeways). The other assumption of course is that the increase in property damage only crashes is due to driver error (distraction).

Serious road cyclist here: Physically separated pathways might be a solution in crowded urban/suburban areas but even there I doubt that enough of them could be built to “solve” the problem. In less crowded areas – forget it, They won’t be built at all. In my experience, most localities that commit to providing better bicycling infrastructure roll out a couple of miles of protected pathways that are isolated and unconnected leaving cyclists to figure out how to navigate through the unprotected areas. Yes, human drivers kill and injure many cyclists but I’m 100% sure that they can recognize a hell of a lot more than 1% of them. Color me unimpressed with the “self-driving” car bezzle that is just another misguided tech/utopian fantasy. If you want to understand why just watch the Air Disaster series on the Smithsonian Channel and see how many accidents are caused by pilots misunderstanding/misusing the autopilot systems or being unable to manually fly the plane when the autopilot system quits or malfunctions (Air France 447 is a great example). This kind of problem is going to be much worse with the average human automobile operator in the far more crowded, less controlled and obstacle filled road environment. Reply ↓ Carolinian June 2, 2017 at 11:58 am Copenhagen has an entire network of bicycle only roads. With enough commitment that could be done here although flat as a pancake Denmark is a lot more bicycle friendly than many US cities. And there were far more air crashes in the pre automation era. Much of that was due to pilot error. These days if pilots don’t know how to use the equipment that too is pilot error. And while there have been examples of badly designed automation in Airbus planes that too is-guess what–human error. Computers were added to airliners for a reason–not as some sort of marketing gimmick. Reply ↓ roadrider June 2, 2017 at 2:33 pm With enough commitment And therein lies the problem – this isn’t Denmark and its unlikely that we’ll get that kind of commitment to bicycling infrastructure. Perhaps we would if everyone were not so hell bent on genuflecting before tech giants and their self-serving boondoggles like self-driving cars. Yes, there were more air crashes in the pre-automation era and would still be if there were no autopilots. That’s not the point. The point is that even highly skilled and trained professionals who go through a much more rigorous selection (and re-certification) process than will ever be the case for automobile drivers can still screw up when complex automated systems are involved, especially when the automated system throws up its hands and says “You take it!” because they’re so unused to the manual procedure any more. And, yes, the badly designed autopilot systems are a result of human imperfection but what are you suggesting – that the self-driving car guys are perfect and will never make mistakes or put out shoddy products or updates that bork the system? That never happens with computer hardware or software, – right? And even if experts at places like Google can get it mostly right (doubtful in any reasonable time frame) what’s going to happen when the inevitable less talented competitors enter the marketplace. I’m all for automated safety systems that override potentially bad actions by drivers but the complete self-driving car is something that I don’t think is either feasible or desirable.

On an episode of Aggressive Progressives a couple weeks ago, Nomiki Konst, who served on the committee, said the Democratic Party’s platform position on fracking was literally written by a fracking lobbyist. And they wonder why they lost: During a 9-hour meeting in St. Louis, Missouri on Friday, members of the DNC’s platform drafting committee voted down a number of measures proposed by Bernie Sanders surrogates that would have come out against the contentious Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), fracking, and the Israeli occupation of Palestine. At the same time, proposals to support a carbon tax, Single Payer healthcare, and a $15 minimum wage tied to inflation were also disregarded…. The panel also rejected amendments suggested by 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben, another Sanders pick, that would have imposed a carbon tax, declared a national moratorium on fracking as well as new fossil fuel drilling leases on federal lands and waters.

If they had done that they could have had the Tories by the balls, with a veto over everything. Reply ↓ Pavel June 2, 2017 at 8:11 am I wish some of the liberals expressing OUTRAGE! over Trump’s decision to exit the Paris accord had been as vocal during Obama’s years of expanding mideast wars. The US military is by far the biggest polluter on the planet, and the US spends $700 billion on armaments. Imagine the environmental impact of: * manufacturing battleships, tanks, F35s, tomahawk missiles, etc * all the fuel used by the military, especially the air force and navy * the Agent Orange, napalm, cluster bombs, depleted uranium — not exactly great for the environment * nuclear weapons use and testing and waste. NB Obama approved a new generation of nukes! * the environmental damage from US missiles cf Syria, Libya, Yemen etc * all the US military bases around the world …etc… Evil mastermind election-hacker Putin’s country spends one-tenth of the US on its military (and still apparently manages to control the world!)

Reply ↓ Pat June 2, 2017 at 10:43 am Hey, I can’t say that we aren’t behind Germany, Great Britain and a goodly number of other countries in this. Nor can any thinking aware egalitarian American deny that we are still battling not just racism but sexism in large areas of our lives. But Clinton playing victim to misogyny is insulting and misleading in a similar way to the attempt to shame Sanders supporters with the “there is a special place in hell for women who don’t support women candidates’ hypocrisy. I hate to say it but people who ignored disagreement with her policies, chose not to examine her ethics failures and in some cases her history of destructive incompetence in order to vote for the candidate with a vagina are also sexist. Then there is the fact that many of those supposedly misogynist Americans who failed to anoint her have female representation locally, at the state level and sometimes even at the federal level, Can it be misogyny if you are willing to be governed or represented by (shudder) a Mia Love or a Nikki Haley and reject Hillary Clinton? Clinton was not the canary in the coal mine for this, and her playing victim doesn’t make it true.

Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner June 2, 2017 at 10:27 am Hillary does portray herself as a victim and in many ways she is, but part of me thinks she is attached to the circle of Clintonistas who have demonstrated loyalty, the used the Clintons like parasites use hosts. Given the acrimony over the state of the Democratic Party, I suspect there are Clinton “loyalists” who are begging Hillary to come out and save them from those mean Bernie Bros. I know she likes the spotlight, but I feel she is being used to gin up support for otherwise unemployable people. Take Robbie Mook. He blew a billion dollars on the last election. Reply ↓ Darn June 2, 2017 at 10:51 am You bet. But being more liberal than Clinton leaves them exposed as an isolated individual to the anger of big biz and the rich. The Clinton machine’s been I operation for decades so they cling to her apron strings. And now they would have a credibility problem if they tried to save their careers by becoming Sandernistas. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner June 2, 2017 at 11:25 am The values of a Clintonista aren’t as relevant as they are attached to a power couple who came to power 25 years ago and faced a strong challenge from a 73 year old Senator from a small out of the way state with no media presence (take that Brattleboro Reformer!) where the paper of record is the Boston Globe. If you weren’t old enough to vote for Bill in 1996, you didn’t vote for Hillary in the primary in 2016. If you were 17 and under last year during the primaries, you weren’t voting for a candidate of 25 years ago. Given the divisive nature of the primaries, all these people who threw their lot in with Clinton Inc separated themselves from the future for immediate rewards of the certainty Hillary would be President. Now they live in a world where the great liberal paper of record hired a bunch of climate change denialists and NBCNews is giving Megan Kelly a major platform to make sure black children understand Santa Claus is white. I see “OMG Russia” as the Clintonistas trying to hold on and deflect blame for their own failures because they don’t have good options as they have lost credibility. Reply ↓ Darn June 2, 2017 at 4:09 pm Well, zOMG Russia!! is partly cos they wanna suck up to powerful neocons in the foreign policy establishment cos they think they wield enough power to crown Clinton or another centrist President in 2020, with the help of fired-up patriotic voters. Because they were already using “Russian hacking” and a demented Syrian-no-fly-zone policy to try and get into power in 2016. It’s not just a post-election excuse for defeat. Dumb to use it again when it failed in November, but the alternative is to move left and take on those interests instead, and they’re too scared. And it’s been in the nature of the Clintons just to brazen things out. Reply ↓ Pat June 2, 2017 at 11:00 am Parasite/host or symbiotic relationship? How many hosts invite their parasites to make a home? They aren’t feeding off the host supplying nothing, this is mutual support. The Clintons worked hard to create this twisted political world. But I am sure you are right there are sure to be a whole lot of people telling her ‘America needs her.’ And they are stuck with HER. She was supposed to acquire her desire and consolidate their power. Now they are scrambling. They spent years clearing the runways for her, and now that she has failed to lift off there is really no one in the wings. Oops. Meanwhile Clinton is entitled and arrogant and that Presidency is still HERS. Symbiotic. Malignant for everyone outside the circle but symbiotic for those in it.

And then you have the distillation of these tendencies in Trump. But as Noonan points out, a grown-up should expect the pricks of conscience, if the person has a conscience. Noonan’s good classical education pays off: The agenbite of inwit. The last sentence of the Wikipedia entry sheds intriguing light and shadow: “In the 20th century, the work gained some recognition when its title was adopted by James Joyce, who used it numerous times in his novel Ulysses as a trope for self-conscience, especially in referencing Hamlet and Walt Whitman. In Joyce’s spelling, agenbite of inwit, the title has gained a limited foothold in the English language.” Reply ↓ TK421 June 2, 2017 at 11:37 am Thanks! You are a scholar and a gentleman.

Instead we get self-serving denial and elaborate conspiracy theories like some sort of mental paranoia. Thank God that lady’s fingers are nowhere near the nuclear launch codes. Can she please just take her millions and go away? It seems like all Hillary knows how to do is punch down. Complaining about her data analyst staff. Whining about Trump’s fake Twitter followers when she had more fake ones than he did throughout the campaign, when she literally spent millions bankrolling a sock puppet operation — which is still ongoing, now rebranded as Share Blue. Seeing her repeatedly call WikiLeaks “Russian”, saying there’s “no difference”, this from the woman who reportedly asked why we couldn’t just “drone” Assange. Stomach-turning evil lunacy. To me it looks like she’s very closely involved in pumping the anti-Trump campaign. She recites the cant too well to not be dictating the talking points. If someone subpoena’d her cell phone they’d probably find a mountain of evidence. Meanwhile the corporate media regard themselves as her protectors and attack dogs, as they did throughout the campaign. Reply ↓ jan June 2, 2017 at 8:23 am Naomi Kleint and the Paris accord: The fact that the agreement only commits governments to keeping warming below an increase of 2 degrees, rather than a much safer firm target of 1.5 degrees, was lobbied for and won by the United States. The fact that the agreement left it to individual nations to determine how much they were willing to do to reach that temperature target, allowing them to come to Paris with commitments that collectively put us on a disastrous course towards more than 3 degrees of warming, was lobbied for and won by the United States. The fact that the agreement treats even these inadequate commitments as non-binding, which means governments apparently do not have anything to fear if they ignore their commitments, is something else that was lobbied for and won by the United States. The fact that the agreement specifically prohibits poor countries from seeking damages for the costs of climate disasters was lobbied for and won by the United States. The fact that it is an “agreement” or an “accord” and not a treaty — the very thing that makes it possible for Trump to stage his action-movie slow-mo walk away, world in flames behind him — was lobbied for and won by the United States.

He did not have senate support to ratify it as a binding treaty, so he chose to make it an “executive agreement” with his administration, with full knowledge that it was valid only for the remaining nine months of his final term. The President’s counterparties in Paris realized that he lacked the support to bind the country. In fact, they watered down the wording of the Agreement to facilitate the Administration’s argument that it does not require ratification. For example, they changed the word “shall” to “should” in many places, and they avoided calling it a “treaty.” The negotiators had a choice between a treaty that might bind the United States and nine-month promise from an outgoing president. They chose the promise from an outgoing president. Any claims that the next administration or the country is “going back on its word” will be disingenuous. Only the Obama administration gave its word, and the other parties in Paris helped design the agreement to make that result possible. http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/276668-president-obamas-signing-of-the-paris-agreement-is Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef June 2, 2017 at 5:58 pm D’accord, on the nine-month promise-accord.

Unpacking this explains everything you need to know about her failure to come to terms with her defeat. In other words, “What Defeat, I Won.” It’s simply a matter of correcting the record. I would like to know if her staff must address her as “Madam President” or if they have given her the nuclear codes to her dummy “football” or if she calls retired generals to discuss military strategy. Of course, her reaction is easy to explain. Her supporters and the MSM have also failed to accept the results. She is their leader and she is faithfully executing her role as their Commander and Chief in absentia. Trump is the imposter. His eviction will come any day. The Revolution will be Glorious.

This world we live in is certainly strange. ———————- I always think of Roald Dahl’s great short story, The Butler, when I see people buying wines like these. In that story, a nouveau riche couple tries to develop a taste for top end wines and meals to accompany their newfound millions and lavish lifestyle. They hire a butler and a French chef, then hold dinner parties with wildly expensive clarets of the very finest vintage. The husband develops a concordant ostentatious manner of waxing rhapsodic about the pricey wines they serve as if he’s an expert and as if the wines are the ultimate nectar from heaven. At the end of the story the butler ends up handing in his resignation and informs the man that he has been substituting the cheapest Spanish reds the whole time and drinking the top stuff with the chef!

Reply ↓ charles leseau June 2, 2017 at 12:46 pm The operative word there being “may.” I believe the point of the story is that they were serving up something that was demonstrably inferior to the couple, but then one would have to question whether there is any cheap Spanish red that could be called bad, or even worse than the most lauded of French wines in the most lauded years. Evidence about taste is in any case always going to lead to that dreaded word “subjective.” Certainly, one could compile enough people who think McDonalds is superior or equal to whatever the chef in the story (or any chef) could cook up too. And I’ve seen enough people in Guardian comments section arguing vehemently that Kanye West is a musical genius. Whether this puts him on the level of a Beethoven, Chopin, or Ellington? I know what I think of that, but no, I’m not going to argue about it no matter how much someone tries to spur me into it. To argue that all cheap Spanish reds are the equal to a top Bordeaux of one of the supposedly great years is thus fine, I guess. Anyone can argue anything along those lines with food or drink. Certainly, ever since the “Judgment of Paris” back in the 1970s people have been looking to knock French wine down a peg or 20. In any case, both the story and the idea that people have for centuries not been able to distinguish value or superiority in wine until apparently now does bring the purchase of a $140,000 bottle into question.

Reply ↓ Alex June 2, 2017 at 9:02 am against white nationalism: full employment & the politics of radical inclusion Essentially what is proposed is to do away with the immigration controls altogether, and the consequences of such policy are not examined well enough. Their argument runs as follows 1) with more people we can build more things 2) even if their culture is different we’re gonna take care of it somehow and 3) it’s gonna be alright It’s hard to believe that there’s not enough people to build or restore all the needed infrastructure in the US or in any other western country. And regarding the culture, if the “newcomers” with different culture outnumber the “natives” (realistically at a municipal or regional level – remember we’re talking about a free entrance to the US) why wouldn’t *their* culture dominate there? Historically the shortage of workers has always worked to their advantage to it’s hard to see how it can be different this time. So the article looks like an attempt to evade the less-than-pleasant-for-certain-people conclusions from both history and MMT Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive June 2, 2017 at 9:27 am “why wouldn’t *their* culture dominate there?” And that would be bad because?????? How much of our culture is because of the Irish, the Asians, the Latinos, the Germans, etc. that have come here as immigrants? I hesitate to include Africans because most of them were not immigrants, but yes they too have added immeasurably to our culture. And yes there were regions (and still are) where the Irish controlled politics, where Asians controlled politics, where the Germans controlled the politics, where the Latinos controlled politics, etc…. I’m wondering what is so “exceptional” about the US that so many people think “everyone” will want to come here? It seems to me that they come here not because the US is “exceptional” but because the US and other countries have destroyed their countries……and there is no where else to go….. Reply ↓ Darn June 2, 2017 at 10:39 am Ppl are concerned that economic growth may be helped by a growing population from immigrants, but per capita incomes would not. And ppl are loss-averse. I assume it has little effect either way, positive or negative. But since a “more mouths to feed, competing for our jobs” argument is simple and plausible, there will always be a big fraction of the public who oppose mass immigration. Enough to swing an election or two. As for cultural dominance, Alex was talking about completely free migration. That means a hell of a lot more cultural dominance than the Irish dominating politics in an American city of yesteryear. There is a language barrier: historically limits of immigration meant English has always been the national language. Completely open migration would change that, and it would be economically inconvenient. Then there is whether greater numbers would help or hinder public services and infrastructure. Even if you think so, you must admit voters’ fears over this would be a political problem, preventing other things getting done. Reply ↓ Alex June 2, 2017 at 12:34 pm Darn, thank you, that was indeed my point. I don’t think immigration is bad per se and certainly every country has been affected by it In addition to that I’d suggest the author to start not from the whole country but think about his town or neighbourhood and conduct a thought experiment – what kind of difficulties can arise and what kind of consequences follow from adding to the current population as many economic migrants that look different and have different culture. Like where would they live, where would they work (especially while they still don’t know the language), who would gain from such an influx etc Reply ↓ Darn June 2, 2017 at 4:22 pm Yes. And at a time of economic stress (after 9 yrs since the Great Recession without full recovery for a large part of the population) ppl are gonna be more desperate for solutions and stopping immigration is an easy idea to grasp. The Brexit vote would never have got to 52% without this. Only partly about immigration, but it got them over the finish line. I don’t think MMT is necessary, but try getting a party for Keynesian stimulus into power when the first question you get asked on the doorstep is, “why don’t you just cut immigration?”. Personally I don’t think we have to sacrifice any votes or other policies just to keep immigration at the current level. Reply ↓ LT June 2, 2017 at 10:49 am There is no shortage of workers. There is a shortage of willingness for those who want work done to bear costs for training workers. Work to be done is all around us, all over the world. The root of the controversy, debate, and employment problem is over who is going to pay for the work and workers and pay for the training.

Reply ↓ clinical wasteman June 2, 2017 at 5:08 pm I’ve asked versions of this question before, and I can’t emphasise enough that — at least when commenting here — I NEVER mean it sarcastically or derisively*. Anyway, here’s one more iteration: “Why stop at ‘this country’ in that case? A hugely disproportionate amount of wealth (and with it, the chances for the non-wealthy to earn an income) circulates inside a few states and cities of the US (just as in Europe, India, China, etc.), but available space and physical resources in those places are limited. Is it also inevitable that New York, California, Bavaria, Guangdong and, say, the Federal District of Mexico must “close the doors” on “deplorables” from elsewhere in the larger federal/national territory? And isn’t that what eg. San Franscisco, Manhattan/Brooklyn, “petit Paris” and parts of London are already doing by way of a de facto “property qualification” for residence?** (*The impolite version — quoted here for information purposes only, because it’s only for use against those “closed doors” advocates who don’t sincerely detest exploitation and economic injustice, i.e. no-one I recall seeing on NC ever: “which do like better, the Chinese Hukou or the South African Pass Laws? Because the only difference between those ‘closed doors’ and ‘national’ ones is the size of the administrative entity.” (**Yes, the property qualification is technically non-discriminatory as well as conveniently deniable, but class cleansing, which is exactly what’s going on in those cities, is always also ethnic to one degree or another.) Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm June 2, 2017 at 7:01 pm An answer to your question — “class cleansing, which is exactly what’s going on in those cities, is always also ethnic to one degree or another” … Yes — I believe that is true. However I don’t believe ethnic cleansing is a root intent — it’s merely a by-product — not a goal per se. Money distribution in the U.S. is strongly tied to “ethnic” — dare I say race — backgrounds. Elsewhere. that is not so much the case — or at any rate the dominant “ethnic” background isn’t always the same as in the U.S. I believe — admittedly without evidence to point to — that the only “color” which matters for purchasing the astronomically priced real estate in too many cities of the U.S. is the color “Green”. [Some ethnic groups have to fight harder to get in than others but “Green” seems to overcome all but the most idiosyncratic obstacles.] Reply ↓ clinical wasteman June 3, 2017 at 7:38 pm Thanks Jeremy for the thoughtful observations. I agree that the ‘ethnic’ part may very well not be a a conscious aim of the cleansing, but that doesn’t seem to stop it happening, and it probably doesn’t matter much mid-eviction or when you know your kids will either have to live with you forever or leave town. Pursuit of “Green” is, as you say, the decisive intention, but the second-third-fourth-degree effects are almost always ‘ethnically’ skewed — or in practice, for those on the receiving end, racist — even if their landlords, bailiffs and bosses are untainted by prejudice deep in their hearts. With the many exceptions duly noticed (i.e. a few rich ‘minority’ brackets and many many ‘non-ethnic'(?!) poor), the ‘race’/power/class breakdown does broadly work that way here in London and elsewhere in the UK too, which is why the recent attempts to set (implicitly ‘white’) ‘working class’ and ‘ethnic/metropolitan’ pseudo-identities against each other — rhetorically expelling ‘minority’ and ‘metropolitan’ workers from our own class — trouble me so much.

Her idea of dealing with the weakness Brexit exposed is to say “meritocracy” and say she’ll build more grammar schools so that middle class kids (it will mostly be them) get a more academic education than working class ones. And cut benefits to disabled people by £30 a week. Then let scaremongering right-wing newspapers do the heavy lifting. Another parallel is her speeches and literature have all said I I I, me me me.

Because the free education that Corbyn is promising will be paid for through the taxes which everybody in the working class has to pay so there’s no “giveaway” involved. Yet somehow when politicians create tax codes riddled with loopholes that let the rich and big corporations get away with paying no taxes whatsoever, that’s not ever construed as a giveaway but as sound fiscal policy that will trickle down to the rest of us.

Reply ↓ Left in Wisconsin June 2, 2017 at 5:43 pm One thing that is of course ignored by Vox is the decline in unionized construction. Not only did the unions insist on apprenticeship programs but the law was flexible enough to allow union workers to fill most of the lower level supervisory positions – so the front-line management actually knew the work. Not all that long ago, most of the big construction projects were still union – non-union was big in residential construction but barely present in big commercial projects. No longer. Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm June 2, 2017 at 9:38 pm I believe the Federal Government is captured and manifestly corrupt. But what little I’ve seen of state and local government leads me to believe the Federal Government is saintly by comparison. Every time I pass a state construction site with one or two “workers” present — trading a shovel back-and-forth — and surrounded by expensive heavy equipment parked around the worksite I can’t help but wonder how much my state pays to rent that sitting equipment [exclusive of the costs to commuters and transport companies — more often to individual truckers] for the delays the “construction” adds to the already horrible transit costs for traveling in my state. I believe even the most cursory investigation of our state transportation department, the governor’s office and/or the contracting my state does would considerably bolster the pockets of myriad defense attorneys while providing countless long-term tenants for our growing Prison Industrial Complex. We can’t repair infrastructure — without breaking the bank? Who are they trying to kid? Reply ↓ KFritz June 3, 2017 at 1:48 am Something not mentioned in the article: worker training. There may be a way to verify this as a culprit/contributory factor to US underperformance. The gold standard of American construction unions is the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). The union and its client employers work well together to ‘produce’ workers who can perform at a high level. It would be interesting to find out whether the IBEW outperforms US construction workers, and/or performs as well as electrician counterparts in comparable nations. If the IBEW does outperform other American workers and compares well to other countries’ electricians, training is certainly one culprit. I’ve also heard, anecdotally, that the American system of contractors and subcontractors is much less efficient than vertically integrated ‘full service’ construction firms , which are the most common form in many other comparable countries.

Why should I feel ashamed? Google knows what I mean. Also, that map can’t be correct. Maybe those words have the highest rate of being misspelled, but I doubt it, because if it was pure frequency relative to attempts that they were looking at it is more likely that very uncommon and difficult words would be the most frequent (i.e. the sort people look up specifically because they’re so uncommon that educated people who might want to use, for example, “autochthonous,” need to look it up because it isn’t in autocorrect dictionaries). So they must have a reasonably high threshold of attempts to make the cut. Also, many of the most common spelling errors are those that google wouldn’t likely catch, because they’re grammatical in nature: affect and effect, they’re their and there, to and too, etc. Also, if it was just aggregate totals of misspellings, I’d bet double or nothing on my student loan debt that in each state the most often misspelled word is “the.” Also, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is a made-up silly word, and the only people who should be ashamed are those who actually think they know the “correct” spelling, and that that somehow matters.

How has it come to this? Reply ↓ Jim Haygood June 2, 2017 at 1:19 pm It started in 1984 under Ronald Reagan and Atty Genl William French Smith. Their diabolical plan was to crank federal sentences so absurdly high (multiple lifetimes in some instances) that most cases would be settled by plea bargains without trials. This vastly increased judicial processing capacity to feed an enlarged federal Gulag. Today about 95 percent of federal criminal cases produce guilty pleas which lead directly to sentencing. “Criminal justice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials,” “Justice” Anthony M. Kennedy wrote in 2012. What passes for criminal justice today bears no resemblance to the pre-1984 system. They substituted a completely different regime, in which going to trial amounts to gambling with the rest of your life, and no one noticed. Current attorney general Ku Klux Jeff Sessions just ordered drug defendants to be whacked with maximum charges.

And in my opinion, most of the state judges I’ve observed (admittedly not all that many) seem afraid to do anything that steps outside Draconian sentencing guidelines established by the state legislature [both Republican AND Democratic legislators]. And, in my humble opinion, prosecutors have little interest in “Justice” — only in improving their chances for promotion within the “system” while minimizing any “risks” they might face for being “too lenient”. This harsh way of things may have started with post-1984 “justice” but they continue — live and well — to this moment.

Without a doubt, it was not Islam that drove young Europeans to crusade. Saladin and his soldiers were just minding their business in their sphere of influence. Reply ↓ Plenue June 2, 2017 at 2:54 pm Both of those views can be simultaneously accurate. There are a whole lot of people, particularly Muslims, who consider Wahhabism in general, and ISIS in particular, to be takfiri apostates, not real Muslims. Certainly the vast majority of the Syrians, Iraqis, and Kurds fighting and dying everyday to stop ISIS and AQ are also Muslim. Wahhabism is so disdained by the majority of Muslims that there’s apparently a widespread conspiracy theory in the middle-east that it was created by the British and/or the CIA as a Trojan horse to undermine Islamic and Arab unity. Personally I find it all a bit No True Scotsman-y. The fact is that in the end the head-choppers consider themselves Muslims who are doing what they believe Allah wants them to do. But it’s also true that a whole lot of the people, particularly Europeans, who sign up for ISIS are apparently so grossly ignorant of the basics of Islam that they had to buy ‘Islam for Dummies’ type books. https://apnews.com/9f94ff7f1e294118956b049a51548b33/islamic-state-gets-know-nothing-recruits-and-rejoices So while Wahhabism is undeniably a branch of Islam, and is the driving ideology of jihadist movements, that doesn’t necessarily mean any kind of piety is what is driving a large number of people to sign up with jihadist groups. Also, Jihad in the sense of a military expedition doesn’t strike me as demonstrably different from a Crusade. And I’ve seen the argument that the Crusades were fundamentally a belated response to the initial Islamic incursions into Europe; they didn’t just happen completely without provocation. But regardless, it’s also clear that the Levant was basically the Wild West for Europeans, and many people signed up in the hope of getting land and riches.

You mean the crusades were a response to the Muslims taking over Spain and failing to invade France…. THREE centuries before? The Muslims invaded western Europe in the 700s. The first crusade was in 1096. The Muslims hadnt taken jack since then. And the crusade wasn’t even focused on Spain, which was indeed actually taken from Christendom, but on the Muslim heartland. Forgive me if I’m skeptical of this hypothesis. Oh yeah, and it also doesn’t explain the fourth crusade, which was aimed at…. Orthodox Greece. I’m pretty sure that explanation is just too facile.

And as for the invasion of Russia, Bulgaria and Ukraine by nomads… They were not Catholic. The Crusades were by West European Catholics only, and bringing up Orthodox Christians other than the Byzantines is completely irrelevant. If anything the crusades made Eastern Europe less safe when the Catholics decided it would be way easier to get loot and plunder by ransacking the Byzantine Empire instead of trying to take Jerusalem back the second time.

Her tenure on the national board’s executive committee is believed to have helped Microsoft, based in Seattle, at a crucial time. In 1980, she discussed her son’s company with John Opel, a fellow committee member and the chairman of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Opel, by some accounts, mentioned Mrs. Gates to other IBM executives. A few weeks later, IBM took a chance by hiring Microsoft, then a small software firm, to develop an operating system for its first personal computer.

At the time, IBM’s mainframe division was king of the company, and they had only released their first midrange computers in 1979. In 1981 personal computers were so under powered compared to what exists today, it’s possible that the IBM executives simply did not believe that the PC would become a major product line. In consequence, maybe they didn’t pay as much attention to the negotiations with Microsoft as they should have.

Belongs here: reslez June 2, 2017 at 6:15 pm I wonder how the Genghis Kahn invasion of the 1300s fit in. The kings of Western Europe were pretty tapped out by that time and only a modest number of troops were raised at noblemen level to defend Western Europe, and they barely pushed into Eastern territory. Plus they had to split and go north to Poland and south east. The Crusaders were still around but not a huge force and they had begun to be under attack from the Church and supportive kings at that time. The only reason the Kahn boys won was Genghis killed his liver, and law recalled the troops back to the homeland to settle the succession. They never did return west, and I haven’t seen any good reason why, other than they just lost interest. Reply ↓ craazyboy June 2, 2017 at 10:58 pm Back to the subject. I’m pretty sure that’s it. I think Gates has confirmed as much, also. IBM was really that dumb. Or had their heads in the Mainframe cloud. PCs were toys, to be made for hobbyists, maybe in garages, with silly names like “Apple”. Or, Altair – Bill’s first employer – and was a hobbyist machine. Basic was the language – not so impressive to a mainframer either. Then Paul Allen was known as the grownup in the room.

It would also be useful if the US was a true democracy so that it could get what the people want which is single payer. “”Economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial impacts on government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence. The scholars’ (Gilens and Page) findings seriously challenge the idea that, as a type of society, the United States is democratic. If a semblance of democracy is reached, it is usually because the rabble has exerted pressure on decision-makers through extra-electoral means – strikes, riots, demonstrations, civil disobedience, even insurgencies; in other words, because they’ve rejected the constraints of the electoral arena and moved the competition to the streets, where the constraints of procedural democracy no longer obtain.”” (Washington’s Long War on Syria) Reply ↓ financial matters June 3, 2017 at 5:45 am This discussion was in light of contrasting the ‘democracies’ of the US and Syria. As an underdeveloped nation struggling against powerful opponents, Syria gives priority to the Ba’ath party as being in favor of Arab secular nationalism. “”In effect ,then, the difference between presidential elections in Syria, under its 1973 constitution, and the United States today, is that presidential candidates in the former were chosen by Arab nationalists to carry out the country’s Arab nationalist mission, while in the latter, the candidates are chosen by the U.S. capitalist class to carry out the country’s capitalist-based imperialist mission. The Syrian system at least had the advantage of representing Syrians en masse as part of an oppressed Arab nation. By contrast, the U.S system almost ineluctably leads to the selection of candidates who have a high probability of being committed to policies that favor their country’s wealthiest citizens at the expense of the voters who elected them.”” (ibid) Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm June 2, 2017 at 9:17 pm I think Weber’s analysis is too limited to explain why we don’t have single payer.

That’s what’s called for when shares in your bank have crashed to 41.3 centavos: The solution for troubled Spanish lender Banco Popular is either a capital raise or a sale, a spokesman for Spain’s government said on Friday, adding that it was not worried about the situation. “(Popular) passed its stress tests … it is in the process of a sale or a capital raise, nothing more. Complete calm. We are going to wait for the next steps,” Inigo Mendez de Vigo told a news conference. Popular says it is seeking a buyer after Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos ruled out a state bailout.

Otherwise I don’t understand why they think its a good idea to raise the rents so high that no business would want to rent there… Reply ↓ Oregoncharles June 2, 2017 at 1:40 pm Did anyone say they were smart? But they might indeed be trying to empty the building for a rebuild. Reply ↓ WeakenedSquire June 2, 2017 at 2:10 pm As long as the space remains vacant, it’s a tax writeoff for the landlord. And even if it takes 4-5 years to fill it, the expectation is that eventually an international retailer will pay the full asking price for a at least a few years, and that will make the wait worth it. You never know when that tenant will come along, either–so best have inventory ready and not tied up in a lease to a struggling mom-and-pop. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef June 2, 2017 at 2:35 pm That strategy calls for an all-cash buyer/landlord, or an owner having access to practically 0% financing. Just one more way the Fed is doing for or to America. Reply ↓ HotFlash June 4, 2017 at 6:06 pm Dunno how it is there, but here (Ontario) commercial leases are voided on sale of the property. New owner, therefore new lease — or not, of course. Residential leases may also be voided, if the buyer is moving family in. I got evicted once that way, although the buyer lied. But I digress. We have lots of commercial properties here, landlords have jacked up the rent and if tenants can’t cough up, vacancy. Currently, the city reduces property taxes for vacant commercial property, and of course, with no income there is no income tax for the owner. Sometimes the places stay vacant for a long time. In my neighbourhood (Parkdale, yes that Parkdale) we are seeing our local coffee shops, bookstores, hairdressers, greengrocers, ethnic food and clothing shops, and barbers replaced with galleries, martini bars, cannabis clinics and (tada!) a 24-hour A&W. Are we going upscale or down? I can’t tell, but it sure is getting different around here.

Reply ↓ crittermom June 2, 2017 at 2:03 pm RE: healthcare/single payer in CA. Isn’t it convenient how the figures can be skewered to make healthcare for all appear impossible? I live in another state. I just received my first bill from the hospital. It was for the tests back in March, before I even began my treatments for Stage III breast cancer. Treatments will be ongoing through the winter, with 5 yrs of estrogen therapy to follow beginning next year when I’ve finished all other procedures. (I now have to wonder how much big pharma will charge for the Estrogen?) Despite having Medicare (I’m 65) plus “the best Medicaid supplement” I’m allowed (which, BTW, doesn’t cover one penny of this), this one bill alone amounts to exactly half my monthly income–despite the $134 mth the govt takes out of my SS for Medicare. All for one day of tests. I called the billing ofc and told ’em they’d better hope I live to be 200, as that’s the only way they’ll get repaid if I’m going to receive bills like this over the coming years. I’m already considered “below extreme poverty level” with just my SS for income. And the Drs wonder why I’m now suffering some depression? Now my car insurance is going up due to the extra miles I’m putting on it to travel to my treatments, despite my clean driving record. Yeah. Ain’t America grand, where healthcare is a privilege and not a right? So, so sad that Bernie was never given an honest chance to win… Reply ↓ reslez June 2, 2017 at 6:52 pm Ain’t that America, where the people are Free and health care is Expensive. How we handle this in the US is by setting up pity pageants on GoFundMe where sick people can portray themselves as deserving of care and donations, the more photogenic the better. But if you do set up a gofundme, or something like it, I hope you post it here so those of us who are able can help. The system is rotten. All we can do is make the world a little brighter for each other. Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm June 2, 2017 at 8:08 pm First question — why doesn’t Medicare or your Medicare Supplement cover the costs of your tests? I’m asking because I wondered why my Medicare Supplement insurer was trying to sell me additional insurance for cancer. What gives? I’m appalled at the costs of medical care in our country but two costs particularly anger me. The first is the cost for hospital care along with the endless hospital subcontractors who pile-on their charges. The second cost — which most particularly relates to your comment — is the totally outrageous costs for lab tests. Lab tests require a location, a low-paid phlebotomist and an overpriced piece of medical equipment. That overpriced piece of medical equipment is often old and probably paid-off in the first few months it runs. There are overpriced reagents and overpriced repairs and maintenance items … but the providers keep a fat part of the charges they make for each test. I believe that in the worst case a state could buy some of this equipment and hire some civil service phlebotomists, pay them well and give them benefits and retirement, and still end up making embarrassing amounts of money for the state coffers while cutting the charges for lab work in half. Most/[all?] states license medical doctors to practice medicine and to some/[full?] extent could control the costs for various treatments. Given the ready willingness to undercut the “market” for engineers and nurses [RNs] through H1B Visas I have often wondered at the remarkable power of the doctor’s union — the AMA. A state like California could make single payer very affordable by modifying a few state laws. Physicians can reasonably and should complain about the outrageous costs of medical school and malpractice insurance and the overheads associated with insurance billing systems. These costs are all under some/[full?] control of a state. Each state has considerable leverage to make single payer work. But who controls the levers? Finally — I hope all comes out well for you. My mother had breast cancer in her early 30’s and it affected her, and her family deeply. I was 13 years old at the time and mostly fussed about getting stuck doing the family dishes. It’s taken years — many many years to grasp even a small part of how this disease devastated my mother. Reply ↓ pzoe June 2, 2017 at 2:52 pm I’m so amused by Hillary’s often stated claim that she really won because she won the popular vote. Reporters echo this mindlessly. I’ve never seen anyone refute this. Hello, it’s the Electoral College, stupid. As every educated marketing person knows one develops a strategy towards winning by winning with the score that counts. For the US Presidency what counts is electoral college votes, not popular votes. So you concentrate your campaign, spend your money, focus your efforts, visits, etc. with the view o fwinning those electoral states. One doesn’t spend time in states where you can get lots of votes but lose. A simile is the 1960 World series where the NY Yankees absolutely dominated in the “runs scored” column but lost in the game score. The Yankees won three games by huge margins but Pittsburgh won its four games and the series by lesser run margins. Reply ↓ Lambert Strether June 2, 2017 at 3:13 pm Yes, I’ve never understood why losing the game by rules you knew going in is considered virtuous. The odd thing is that the failure mirrors 2008’s Democrat primary, where Clinton pulled even with the popular vote, won all the large states, but butchered the delegate count, apparently because they didn’t know how caucus states worked. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef June 2, 2017 at 3:16 pm Girl made underclassman kowtow to her. From Kowtow, courtesy of Wikipedia: Kowtow, which is borrowed from kau tau in Cantonese (koutou in Mandarin Chinese), is the act of deep respect shown by prostration, that is, kneeling and bowing so low as to have one’s head touching the ground. An alternative Chinese term is ketou; however, the meaning is somewhat altered: kou (叩) has the general meaning of knock, whereas ke (磕) has the general meaning of “touch upon (a surface)”, tou (頭) meaning head. The date of this custom’s origin is probably sometime between the Spring and Autumn Period, or the Warring States Period of China’s history because it is already known to have been a custom by the time of the Qin Dynasty (221 BCE – 206 BCE).[citation needed] Did the underclassman have to prostrate and make a knocking sound on the ground?

Hillary lost and Trump won. Why is it so hard to get past the strange events of 2016? True — it is wise to learn from history. But when will November 2016 fade into a moment of history instead of a cluster-point for thrashing about? I disagree with you about there being too many links. I would prefer the more to less. I can pick through this level of links to find what I’m really interested in. I would be very hard pressed to sift through the web to find what is of value.

Schools as we know them are obsolete and are indeed a waste of tax money and the human capital that keeps the machine going.

Posted By Jane Danes on Jun 3, 2017 | 0 comments Share the joy                 Source: https://pixabay.com/en/entrepreneur-idea-competence-vision-1340649/ As a website owner, you would want your site to be visible to your potential customers. One way to do that is to rank better on Google. You need your pages to appear on top of the Google search result. In this post, let’s take a look at ways on how to improve your search engine ranking using social media marketing. Find where your customers are If you want to stabilize your rankings, you must find where your potential customers are. It’s reported that almost three billion people are using social media. The number is up by 22 percent. Hence, most businesses are investing in social media. They even train their employees to handle their customer service on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites. If you failed to respond through social media channels, your existing customers are more likely to switch provider. Since your goal is to improve your search engine ranking, you need more people to talk about your brand. You can’t achieve that if your customers aren’t satisfied with your company. But if they’re pleased with how you interact with them on social media, they’re likely to talk about you on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites. And the more they talk about you; the more Google would recognize your company. Post links on social media The primary objective of Google is to provide the most relevant results to the users. When you search something on Google, you could see that it displays authority pages on top of the SERP. Although Google doesn’t utilize social signal to rank your web pages, it does treat social media sites like other pages. Thus, if a topic occurs on Twitter and it can crawl it, Google returns it in its search results. Therefore, when your customers post your website links on popular media sites, you could expect your ranking to boost because these links are considered as credible backlinks. It could lead to better page ranks. Get better traffic As mentioned earlier, social media has billions of users. Thus, it has become a useful tool for marketers to boost their website’s ranking. You can quickly drive targeted traffic to your site through Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter and other popular social media sites. The more traffic you get from these sites, the better it is for your ranking. That’s because Google recognizes massive referral traffic as an indication that your site is reputable. The larger your followers are on social media, the more they could help in improving click through. The more posts you share on social media, the more search engines would think that your content has value. But make sure that you include keywords in your posts so that your target audience could find your posts. When your readers find your content on social media, they will visit your site. If they love your content, they would share it on social media. Doing so would help increase the authenticity of those click-throughs, thereby, improving your site statistics. This, too, could help your site rank better on Google. Develop True Relationships With Followers But to increase your followers, you need to develop relationships. To earn a genuine relationship with your fans, you should earn their trust and respect. For it to last, you need to give them something of value, and they do something for you, too. It’s useless to have thousands of followers on Twitter if they don’t communicate with you. To nurture a relationship on social media, you need to make people feel that you value them. Once they feel that, they are most likely to connect with you and be loyal to your brand. You must have an ongoing dialogue with them to reinforce that feeling. You need to deliver value if you want that relationship to grow and be stable over time. Since social media is a community, you must contribute to it in various ways and recognize other people’s contributions. You can do so by promoting other brands or people’s videos by liking, replying or retweeting/sharing them on your social media accounts or blog posts. Be Trustworthy Why would someone visit your website when they see it on social media if you don’t appear to be trustworthy? The success of every brand relies on trust. To start earning that trust, your messages on social media must be authentic. You must always be yourself whether you’re speaking about your organization or your products. On social media, you should be a thoughtful and supportive member of the community. And don’t forget to exhibit a funny bone to help you keep in good standing. Bear in mind that having a great sense of humor is always an effective ice breaker. Listen to your customers Intentional listening should be a part of your social media marketing. When you do so, you can find your target audience and be able to understand their needs. After that, you can effectively communicate with them in a way that it can establish trust and long-lasting relationship. To do so, spend your time learning on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites to know more about your target audience and what they’re saying about you and other brands. It’s also ideal that you monitor your competitors carefully. Know about what marketing messages they share on social media. Find out if they’re listening to their customers. Plan Before you even jump right in the social media marketing because it’s proven to boost search engine ranking, you need to develop a plan first. Make sure that you know how to integrate social media into your existing strategy. After listening to your audience, you’ll know what your target market cares about and what your potential customers are talking on social media. From that information, you can determine the kind of message that you can share and communicate with those people. As your social media followers grow, it’ll improve your brand’s relevance. It can lead to a better number of individuals reaching out to your brand and commenting on your posts regularly. You must learn how to fully engage your audience, so they keep talking about you.

Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close Amazon and Google currently dominate the home hub market. (AP File Photo/Jeff Chiu)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Speculation over what Apple will do to compete in the home hub market is spinning up ahead of Apple's annual developer's conference, where many analysts expect Apple will confirm the project. And what will be the Apple home hub's distinguishing feature? It may be sound quality, according a report from Bloomberg. The Siri-infused speaker will really focus on producing quality surround sound and may also have a feature that can measure the room it's in and adjust its sound accordingly, the report said. While there were not any details on how this room-adapting feature works, it sounds similar to one already on Sonos speakers, called TruePlay, which uses the microphone in an iOS device to measure a room. Apple declined to comment on the report. Focusing on sound quality would give Apple an advantage, particularly given its historical strength in music, if it moves to another front in its war against Google and Amazon. Both firms already have smart speakers on the market that integrate with their own services, but are somewhat lacking when it comes to sound quality. Still, it will be stiff competition. Both Google and Amazon are continually adding features to their devices and the voice assistants they house. Google, at its own developers conference, announced that its Google Home will work with more devices, thanks to a Bluetooth connection, as well as even deeper integration with its own services. And Amazon on Thursday announced that its Echo line of smart home hubs now lets users further customize their reminders and timers on the device -- a small but useful update for two core uses of these devices. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) Apart from focusing on sound quality, Apple will also have to find ways to leverage its own ecosystem of services -- iTunes, the App Store, HomeKit, Siri and more -- to convince potential buyers that its hub is right for them. It's not yet clear how it will do this, though Bloomberg reports there will be "deep integration" with Apple services. However, contrary to prior reports from analysts, the Bloomberg report said there will not be a screen on Apple's home hub. That could mean it won't compete, as expected, with Amazon's recent Echo Look -- a home hub that allows for video calling and potentially threatens Apple's FaceTime. Still, Apple has laid some groundwork in the home hub space before, by allowing some smart home devices such as light bulbs to be controlled through its Apple TV, and prominently featuring its own apps for the living room. A smart speaker that builds on what Apple TV has offered would give users more flexibility to decide where to place their home hub.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !dy164c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs454MarketDriveGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!dy164c:....,..... Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd... Mainly I get approximately 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours constantly.And magnificent factor with this job is the fact that you can supervise time when you do the job and for just how long as you wish for and you attain a check week by week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now needa I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable.

Even all the receipts, addresses, and other junk. Google recently added archiving to get that stuff out of the main timeline, but now it's going a step further by suggesting photos to archive. It sounds like the feature we spotted in a recent APK Teardown. The suggestions will appear as a card in the Assistant tab inside Photos. Google will use its machine learning magic to figure out what's in the photo, marking potentially unimportant ones for archiving. You then have the chance to evaluate the selections before proceeding, so you won't accidentally sweep up any important pics. New!

Mine is automatically turned on when I just checked it right now. needa Nothing for me. DP2 XL needa I have thousands duplicate type photos. I seriously hope it advises me to archive all of them. I have been waiting for Google to do something like this for a while now. Maybe if I can get rid of all the clutter, I can stick stuff in albums and clean it all up. Mustafa Selçuk Öztürk I got the update and it shows under Assistant Cards, but no suggestion yet. Waiting patiently... myssi it must be processing your photos brkshr This archiving feature is a godsend!!! My wedding and my honeymoon tour of 7 national parks takes up at least a third of the photo's I have saved from the past 15 years or so. I already archived about half of my wedding photo's. Now I just need to get through the metric ton of honeymoon photo's I have of nature and driving and it will be much easier to find the important photo's. Dennis Ulijn It's also important to solve this problem from the other end: start realizing which photos matter to you. Nature pictures? Architectural pictures? Portraits, group pictures? Nature and architecture are abundant, I just try to shoot the people I'm with, mostly spontaneously or without the knowing because I want to capture the moment. I don't have to archive many photos, and I do take a lot of pictures of my kids. abc Some people like nature more than people. :) Besides, the easiest solution is not take any pics at all because someone else in the group will do it and share them with you. Dennis Ulijn I doubt my toddlers will take a good picture ;-) well, to each their own. Sometimes avoiding the problem is simpler than solving it. Lourdesdcruz Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Facts Cool feature Erstam I wish they would adopt a folder and sub folder like structure. I would still much rather organize my photos that way. It suggested i archive all my screen shots. Meh. Rudder2 JunkMail I agree with you. I hate Google Photos' organization and use Google Drive instead because I like organizing my photos with folders and subfolders. Another beef with Google Photos is it doesn't recognize my Google Drive Photo folders as albums. Google has a lot to learn how people like to organize photos. The Google Drive help line tried to get me to switch to Google Photos and I gave him an ear load. I spend hours organizing my photos on my computer and Google just doesn't care and wants us to do it again in their app. Anon They need to let us archive entire folders automatically, like the whatsapp image folder Vlad > Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. No it's not. This is EXACTLY how it works in Gmail and how I count on it to work. Everything is still categorised, it's just not there when opening gmail.com Cakefish This is completely unrelated to the article but I'm getting very impatient waiting for Motorola and Nokia to reveal their 2017 phones. Do you have any news on release dates for us AP? DynamikD I'm glad about this feature. Great way to hide photos that you may not want to people to view. I don't quite understand why people still complain about not being able to create folders though. It's an archaic way of doing things. That's why you can create albums within photos. Serves the same function but it leverages meta data which is more efficient and makes searching for photos and videos easier within the app. Yuri Vidal if google photos would only give me the option to NOT BACKUP my screenshots... i hate it! (Samsung stores screenshots under /DCIM/Screenshots so, google photos thinks they are pictures and uploads them. There is no way to unselect this folder, since it is a subfolder of the pitures folder... PLEASE FIX THIS! Ozl This is just great! i have a lot of files being uploaded on wifi from whatsapp and some i forget to delete, and others are just there just in case, so yes, Thanks Google! Fruity101079 I thought this archive function was useless, and it is for me, but when i see your comments, i guess i was wrong. It seems to be useful to a lot of you who didn't take time to organize and arrange your photos.

The update also added the ability to assign names to different timers for better management.  ( Amazon Echo | Twitter ) The Alexa-powered Amazon Echo smart speaker is ruling the markets since it first debuted in 2016. Compared to the Google Home, the Echo is always a step ahead in its features and capabilities. However, a very basic functionality, which both devices lacked, was the ability to set reminders. Earlier in May, Google's leaked APK files revealed that the company was finally working on the reminder feature and would update its smart speaker soon. Amazon has once again beaten Google to release the reminder functionality. Alexa will now be able to set reminders for any appointments, events, and activities. Amazon Echo Users Will Now Be Able To Set Reminders The update was released on Thursday, June 1. Following this update, Echo users will now be able to able to set reminders simply with their voices. For instance, a user can say "Alexa, remind me to watch Game of Thrones at 9 p.m. on July 16," and the Echo will alert them of the same when the time comes. When the reminder is due, a blue light ring will appear on the Echo before Alexa reminds the users of the assigned alert. It is important to note that reminders are device specific, which means that the reminder set on your Amazon Echo at home will not be able to alert you of the same through the Echo device in your office. The syncing feature is not yet supported, but may be added at a later point. Users will also not be able to sync the reminder list from third-party apps, such as Todoist. In such cases, users will have to manually make each of the reminders on the smart speaker, if they so desire. Amazon Echo Update To Timers Currently, Echo owners were using the timer feature to set reminders. It was an easy way of doing so in absence of the real Reminder functionality. However, reminders through timers could only be set for the same day and not for the future. Amazon has also updated the timer functionality on its speaker. Users will now be able to name the timers set, which is a handy addition for people who have more than one timer set at a time. For instance, people cooking multiple dishes may now ask the Echo to set up each timer with the name of their corresponding dishes. For example, users can say "Alexa, set a pizza timer" and can even check on these timers by simply saying "Alexa, how much time is left on the pasta timer?" Both the features the new update adds will likely satisfy the smart speaker's users, as Amazon shared that named timers and reminders were the most requested functionalities for the Echo.

You'll be able to get one soon. Samsung Galaxy S8 launch Samsung Galaxy S8 looks amazing, but we have big questions Samsung Galaxy S8 gives Samsung a second chance Everything announced at Samsung Unpacked Samsung's first Wi-Fi system, the Connect Home, will be available for preorder at Best Buy on June 4 at $170 for a single unit or $380 for a pack of three units. (Pricing and availability for the UK and Australia are not yet available, but $170 is about £130 or AU$230.) The Connect Home is a midtier (2x2 MU-MIMO 802.11ac) system that's very similar to the Google Wifi. If you get a pack of three, one unit connects to your broadband modem and the rest of the units work as network extenders, making a seamless Wi-Fi network with a large coverage area. Each of its identical units has two network ports. In similar products with this design, the goal has been to make it easier for the average consumer to cover an entire home with a strong wireless networking signal. Also available for preorder on June 4 is the Connect Home Pro that costs $250 per unit. The Connect Home Pro shares the design and features of the Connect Home but supports the top-tier Wi-Fi spec (4x4 MU-MIMO 802.11ac) and hence has much faster Wi-Fi speeds. You can get up to five Pro units to setup a home mesh, or use it interchangeably with as other Connect Home units. An all-in-one mobile app Like other Wi-Fi systems, the Connect Home is connected to a mobile app you use to set up and manage your home network. Samsung has some big ambitions for this app, however. Apart from managing the Wi-Fi network it will also enable users to manage -- including the setup process -- Samsung-branded smart household devices, ranging from cameras to large appliances. The router also works as a hub for Samsung's SmartThings home automation system, and the app will let you program and control SmartThings-compatible devices from third-party product makers. Each Samsung Smart Connect home hardware unit is compact and has two network ports. Joshua Goldman/CNET The SmartThings twist This unified approach has been a long time coming. Since Samsung acquired SmartThings in August 2014, this is the first time Samsung has united its own connected large appliances with SmartThings-compatible products in the same hub hardware and support application. This means you won't need a separate SmartThings Hub anymore. Samsung says the new Connect Home has built-in Zigbee and Z-Wave -- popular light-weight wireless standards for home automation -- and is compatible with hundreds of third-party smart home devices, such as Philips Hue Lights, Netgear Arlo Camera and Ring Video Doorbell. If the device and the software work as expected, you will just need the Connect Home to control your entire home, and have Wi-Fi at every corner. It's a win-win.

Here are 16 of the most useful apps for Google Home. Smart Home by Taylor Martin June 2, 2017 3:15 PM PDT @caspertek Google introduced Actions for Google Home, third-party integrations that work a lot like skills for Alexa, back in January. Since then, the list of available services -- now called Assistant apps -- has grown, giving users access to additional news sources, food or book recommendations and much more. Unlike Alexa skills, third-party services for Google Home ($109.99 at Dell Home) just work. To use them, you only need to know the invocation, which can be found in the Google Home app under More settings > Assistant apps. We've included some examples below, too. Here are 30 of the best Assistant apps you should already be using. Update, June 2: Originally published on February 8, 2017, this article is regularly updated to include new Assistant apps and new information. 5 most useful Google Home commands As a voice assistant, Google Home is supposed to make your life easier. Here are five of the most useful commands to try. by Taylor Martin 2:51 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Food and recipes Whether it's ordering a meal or asking for recipe recommendations, smart speakers have naturally become kitchen companions. Google Home is no exception. You can order Dominos with Google Home simply by saying, "OK Google, let me talk to Dominos," or, "OK Google, talk to Dominos and get my Easy Order." You can also track an order you've placed by saying, "OK Google, talk to Dominos and track my order." With the Food Network app, you can ask for recipes by specific chefs, what shows are coming on tonight or even to get the recipe for what's currently on TV. Just say, "OK Google, ask Food Network to send me the recipes on TV right now," and if there is a recipe on the show playing for your time zone, it will be sent straight to your inbox. Drinks My Wine Guide will give you wine pairings for your favorite foods. Just ask to talk to My Wine Guide and the app will walk you through pairings for the meal you're preparing. Tender can suggest cocktails for you, walk you through making a drink or even tell you what's in a certain cocktail. For suggestions, say, "OK Google, ask Tender for drinks like a mojito." Another similar app is called The Bartender. Beer Guide will tell you about your favorite beers, or beers you'd like to try. Just say, "OK, Google, tell me about [beer name]," and Beer Guide will tell you the brewer, type of beer, its ABV and give a short description of the beer. Smart home Google is hellbent on adding support for a growing list of smart home brands. Several are directly integrated with Google Home, such as Lifx, Philips Hue, Nest, SmartThings and WeMo. But many more smart home brands have added support for Google Home with Assistant apps. The Geneva Home app allows you to control your GE smart appliances with Google Home. Preheat the oven, heat water for coffee, ask when the dishwasher will finish, ask if the dryer is finished and much more. Just say, "OK, Google, let me talk to Geneva Home." Likewise, the LG app allows you to check the status of the dishwasher, set the AC temperature or start your robot vacuum. Ring allows you to control your home security with Google Home. Turn on motion alerts, begin a recording or check your last notification. Say something like, "OK, Google, ask Ring about the last time my doorbell rang." Similarly, using Harmony, you can control your home entertainment system using your voice. Turn on the TV, start up Netflix and more. August recently added support for door locks. You can use Google Home to lock your doors or check on the status of a specific lock. Unfortunately, you cannot yet unlock doors with August using Google Home. Cars Blue Link by Hyundai allows you to remotely control compatible vehicles using Google Home. You will need to link your MyHyundai account and provide a PIN when interacting with the app, but you will be able to remotely start your car and set the AC temperature, send directions to the navigation unit and control the charging state of your hybrid. Mercedes me is a similar app for Mercedes owners. You can remotely set the temperature, start the car and lock the doors. Health The WebMD app is exactly what you would expect, a voice-controlled version of the website. You can ask about conditions, specific drugs or side effects. Your dog's health is important, too, and Dr. Doggy can tell you if the treat you want to give your dog is safe or not. Say, "OK Google, ask Dr. Doggy if it's safe for my dog to eat apples." 5-minute plank does exactly what you would think -- it walks you through a common 5-minute plank workout. To get started, just say, "OK, Google, let me talk to 5-minute plank." Movies and books If you're looking for something to watch, And Chill can give you recommendations based on another movie you like and why you like it, such as the twist at the end or the suspense. The itcher app recommends movies, as well, but it can also recommend books. Link your Google and itcher accounts to get even more personalized, community-based recommendations. To check the critics' rating for a movie before you watch it, use Tomato Reviews. It pulls ratings from Rotten Tomatoes. Just say, "OK, Google, talk to Tomato Reviews about 'Split.'" Games To start up a game of blackjack, just say, "OK Google, let me talk to 21 Blackjack." You will be dealt a hand and you can choose to hit or stand. The game keeps a record of your wins and losses. You can also ask for advice and for the official rules. Akinator the genie is the classic guessing game. You choose a character and Akinator asks you a series of questions until it can guess your character. It's not often you can stump the genie. The Magic Door is a choose-your-own-adventure story game that's filled with hidden items and riddles. To start, just say, "OK Google, open the magic door." Bots that can hold a conversation Clever Girl is an artificially intelligent conversational bot based on Cleverbot. Start a conversation by saying, "OK Google, talk to Clever Girl." Then you can carry on a conversation as long as you'd like. If you'd rather talk with real people, Random Conversations allows you to talk with random Google Home users. You record short messages that are then transcribed and read back to whomever the recipient is. You can carry on a conversation with the same person -- or multiple people (separately) -- sort of like digital pen pals. And other random apps To hear about the newest products for the day, ask to talk to Product Hunt. It will give you the top three products by default, and more products if you ask. AutoVoice allows you to create your own commands for Google Home. It requires the AutoVoice and Tasker Android apps, as well as a fair amount of setup. But once it's up and running, the sky is the limit. Cool Events pulls events from TicketMaster, MeetUps, SeatGeek and EventBrite. Just ask for Cool Events and specify your location. Tell it which source you'd like to hear about events from and it will list all nearby events. Date Night will provide you with suggestions for what to do on your next date. From going skinny-dipping to checking out a farmer's market and cooking a meal with what you buy or buying each other new fragrances, anything to switch up date night will be a welcome change. The eBay Assistant app can give you the value of items. Say something like, "OK, Google, ask eBay what an Apple Watch is worth." It will ask whether it's new or used and give you an approximate value for how much it's worth. If you're unhappy with the way Google Home handles shopping lists, your best bet is to use OurGroceries. It will require you to create an OurGroceries account, but you will be able to manage multiple shopping lists and view them from the mobile apps or from the web. Say, "OK, Google, ask OurGroceries to add milk to [list name]," or, "OK, Google, ask OurGroceries to remove eggs from [list name]." While you can check on flight prices with Google Home out of the box, you can't check on hotels or rental cars. That's where the Kayak app comes in. Just say, "OK, Google, ask Kayak to find new travel destinations," or, "OK, Google, find a hotel in New York City." We publish a new Google Home tip every week.

According to a report in BuzzFeed, Waymo’s self-driving truck was spotted in a photo and the development was later confirmed by the company. A spokesperson from Waymo — Google’s self-driving car arm — said that it took “eight years of experience in building self-driving hardware and software and conducting a technical exploration into how our technology can integrate into a truck.” Safety was the focus of the expansion into the sector, the spokesperson said, with the aim of reducing “thousands of trucking-related deaths each year”. Waymo confirmed that it was only testing one vehicle at the moment and it was still manually driving it on a public road in order to collect data. Its rival Uber has already delivered its first shipment in a self-driving freight vehicle last August — a short time after it bought trucking startup Otto for $680 million. Waymo and Uber became fierce rivals when the former sued and filed a lawsuit against the latter for allegedly stealing trade secrets and self-driving technology from it. The lawsuit argued that former Waymo manager Anthony Levandowski took information when he left the company and later co-founded Otto in January 2016. Earlier this week, Uber fired Levandowski for allegedly stealing some 14,000 documents from Waymo.

According to cyber security firm Check Point, dozens of malicious apps were downloaded between 4.5 million to 18.5 million times from the Play Store. Some of the malware-affected apps have been discovered residing on the online store for several years. “Judy” is one such case of how an open and free mobile operating system (OS) can be exploited by malicious app developers. Most security flaws we hear about now affect old builds of the OS or require clever social engineering to get the user to weaken device security, technology website extremetech.com reported on Friday.The versions of Android being released now are more secure than what Google was putting out years ago and as a result no one has managed to claim Google’s largest bug bounties for Android. Hoping to attract more researchers and engineers to the bug bounty programme, the company has increased the rewards to up to $2,00,000. Google started the bug bounty programme for Android about two years ago in which the security researchers, who demonstrate an exploit, get a cash prize — the amount of which varies based on the severity of the hack. Then, Google gets to fix the bug and avoid future security issues. Still, no one has submitted a working exploit for Android’s core components, even when such an exploit is worth $30,000-$50,000, the report said.

Visitors to Google’s homepage might be asking themselves, who was Josephine Baker and how she become one of the first African-American artists and Civil Rights Movement activists, who dedicated her life to bring a significant change in the society? Born as Freda Josephine McDonald, Josephine Baker was a French vedette singer and entertainer, whose career was centered primarily in Europe, and mostly in France. She grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, in the early 1900’s and began dancing and singing with the Jones Family Band and Dixie Steppers. At the age of 13, Josephine started working as a waitress at the Old Chauffeur’s Club at 3133 Pine Street. She also lived as a street child in the slums of St. Louis, sleeping in cardboard shelters, scavenging for food in garbage cans, making a living with street-corner dancing. Baker made her way to the New York City and joined the chorus of the musical Shuffle Along. However, the worldwide recognition she got was from her visit to Paris, where she finally became a jazz icon and found her new true home. As the star of the musical show La Revue Nègre, Josephine Baker became famous for appearing on stage wearing a banana skirt and little else. Happy Birthday to Josephine Baker. Civil Rights activist , Jazz pioneer and the first woman of African decent to become world famous. pic.twitter.com/C92KiJsBfC — ʎɐz (@thebigcelery) June 3, 2017 I'm obsessed with google's Josephine Baker doodle today pic.twitter.com/XofjuEXeWv — kate gabrielle (@kategabrielle) June 3, 2017 According to the book Josephine: The Hungry Heart written by her foster son Jean-Claude Baker, in later shows in Paris, she was often spotted on stage with her pet cheetah, who was jeweled with a diamond collar. After a few stunts and her exotic dance steps, she became the most successful American entertainer working in France. Ernest Hemingway once called her “the most sensational woman anyone ever saw.” Aside from her exotic costumes that once became the talk of the town, she is being celebrated today by Google for her work towards female liberation and her extensive work during World War II. [Image by Francois Mori/AP Images] When France declared war on Germany in September 1939, Josephine Baker was recruited by the Deuxième Bureau — French military intelligence — as an “honorable correspondent.” Given her position as an entertainer, she was invited to attend parties, during which she gathered information at the Italian embassy without raising any suspicions on her part. After the war, she was awarded the Croix de Guerre by the French military and was named a Chevalier of the Legion d’honneur by General Charles de Gaulle. Over the years, this jazz icon has been compared to Beyoncé for her stunning physique as well as Angelina Jolie for her many adoptions from around the world, both of whom she predates. Josephine Baker started supporting the Civil Rights Movement during 1950. According to Rose Phyllis’ Jazz Cleopatra: Josephine Baker in Her Time, when she arrived in New York along with her husband Jo, they were refused reservations at 36 hotels because of her ethnicity. [Image by AP Images] By this racial discrimination, she was so upset that she wrote articles about the segregation in the United States. She even refused to perform for segregated audiences in the United States, although she was offered $10,000 by a Miami club. Not only this, while working with the Civil Rights Movement, she began adopting children, whom she often referred to as her “rainbow tribe.” Just like this, Josephine Baker tried to bring changes to society. “It’s almost impossible, to sum up such a multi-faceted figure, which is why today’s Doodle is in a slideshow format highlighting several of Baker’s most impactful accomplishments,” Doodle designer Lydia Nichols told Refinery29. “The bold, limited palette and simple aesthetic were influenced by poster art of the 1920s and 30s when Baker broke onto the scene.” [Featured Image by AP Images] Share 3 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Contributor Viraj Mahajan Tags: Josephine Baker, Rihanna to play Josephine Baker?, google doodles, google doodle June 4, 2017 Portland Protests Update: Demonstrations Turn Violent At Pro-Trump, Alt-Right Rally June 4, 2017 Vanessa Williams, 54, Shows Curves, Detests Wearing Bikini While Filming New Comedy-Drama Comments LATEST HEADLINES ‘The White Princess’ Stuns With Devastating Finale [Episode 8 Recap and Review] [Opinion] Is Ariana Grande Getting Married Soon?

According to a report in BuzzFeed, Waymo's self-driving truck was spotted in a photo and the development was later confirmed by the company. A spokesperson from Waymo -- Google's self-driving car arm -- said that it took "eight years of experience in building self-driving hardware and software and conducting a technical exploration into how our technology can integrate into a truck." Safety was the focus of the expansion into the sector, the spokesperson said, with the aim of reducing "thousands of trucking-related deaths each year". Waymo confirmed that it was only testing one vehicle at the moment and it was still manually driving it on a public road in order to collect data. Its rival Uber has already delivered its first shipment in a self-driving freight vehicle last August -- a short time after it bought trucking startup Otto for $680 million. Waymo and Uber became fierce rivals when the former sued and filed a lawsuit against the latter for allegedly stealing trade secrets and self-driving technology from it. The lawsuit argued that former Waymo manager Anthony Levandowski took information when he left the company and later co-founded Otto in January 2016.

This morning, multiple sources have confirmed this will indeed be Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, and here’s what Nexus smartphone and tablets owners need to know. On October 5th Google released Android 6.0 Marshmallow, along with the brand new Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P smartphones. Now nearly two months later the first small maintenance update is here, set to roll out later today and all week long. Read: New Android Emoji Release Confirmed The update to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow appears to be a rather small one aimed at delivering a few small changes for tablets, likely some security improvements, performance enhancements, but most of all it’s changing emoji characters. Here’s what we know so far, and we’ll confirm more once the updates start arriving. With the release of iOS 9.1 back in October Apple delivered over 150 new emoji characters for iPhone owners. Allowing users to express themselves with the keyboard in ways never available before. Emoji keyboards are getting increasingly more popular, and Google quickly said they too, would be adding more to Android. Like the popular taco emoji, multiple different fingers and hand gestures, tons of food, additional faces and more. The release of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow appears to mostly be for that, but other changes are includes which is why we’re seeing a version bump to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. What’s New Google will be adding over 200 new emoji to Android with the update to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, as a part of Unicode 8. This is a system level software update to the font, which is why Google couldn’t just update the keyboard on the Play Store. Ars Technica confirmed the update is Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, has a list of all 200 new emoji coming soon, as well as a few other small details regarding the software update. Read: Android 6.0 vs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop: What’s New in Marshmallow With Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow all Nexus smartphones and tablets, and eventually other phones and tablets will see some small changes. Nothing huge or noteworthy has been found, but we’ll know more soon. Here’s what we know so far, and we’ll confirm more details when the update arrives. There will be over 200 new emoji characters built into stock Android, and other manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and more will need to update to Android 6.0.1 as well. The navigation bar on Android tablets has been changed. With 6.0.1 the back, home, and multi-taksing buttons which were on the bottom center of the screen, will now be split and to the edges. Meaning users can easily hit back or home at the bottom left of the screen with their thumbs, and the square multi-tasking button will be on the bottom right. Making using tablets easier than before and similar to old Android tablets from a few years ago. There are also additional changes to the Do-Not-disturb controls. Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow will also have the latest security patches for the month of December. There could be other changes, battery or performance improvements and more, but we can’t be sure until the update arrives. We could also see fixes for the recent reports of RGB colors being wrong in Marshmallow. Android 6.0.1 Release Date According to Google’s VP of Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer and a few posts to Twitter, the Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update will start rolling out to new Nexus devices later today, and continue all week long for others. Meaning most users should have it before the end of the week, or early next week at the latest. We don’t know which devices will get it first, but most likely will be the new Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. This will be a small over-the-air software update that will automatically appear. Users can also head into settings > about phone (or tablet) > check for updates, and manually install the software once it’s released for your specific device. What Devices Will Get Android 6.0.1 There hasn’t been any formal announcement yet, but most likely all new Nexus smartphones and tablets that are on Android 6.0 will get the new 6.0.1 update. Those being the Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 7 (2013), the Nexus 9 and Google’s Nexus Player. Google has yet to officially announce Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with all the changes or release the factory images, but we’re expecting them to be released later today. Once they arrive users can manually update if they’d like, wait for software updates to arrive, and get the latest software right from Google. As for other devices from popular manufacturers, the wait will continue. Most users in the United States with the Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, LG G4, Moto X and more are all still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and now that wait could be even longer. The good news is the Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update appears to be rather small, so manufacturers can add the changes and release the update as soon as possible. Most likely all devices that aren’t a Nexus should see updates later this month, in early January, and possibly into February. As soon as Samsung, LG, Motorola and others reveal release dates, we’ll be sure to update with all the details.

According to cyber security firm Check Point, dozens of malicious apps were downloaded between 4.5 million to 18.5 million times from the Play Store. Some of the malware-affected apps have been discovered residing on the online store for several years. "Judy" is one such case of how an open and free mobile operating system (OS) can be exploited by malicious app developers. Most security flaws we hear about now affect old builds of the OS or require clever social engineering to get the user to weaken device security, technology website extremetech.com reported on Friday. The versions of Android being released now are more secure than what Google was putting out years ago and as a result no one has managed to claim Google's largest bug bounties for Android. Hoping to attract more researchers and engineers to the bug bounty programme, the company has increased the rewards to up to $2,00,000. Google started the bug bounty programme for Android about two years ago in which the security researchers, who demonstrate an exploit, get a cash prize -- the amount of which varies based on the severity of the hack. Then, Google gets to fix the bug and avoid future security issues. Still, no one has submitted a working exploit for Android's core components, even when such an exploit is worth $30,000-$50,000, the report said.

Not looking good for the lads out West, the Hurricanes converting two tries in the first half, the hosts yet to score. And that’s where we’ll leave this particular fixture for tonight. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.58am EDT 08:58 THAT WAS THE DAY THAT WAS PLAY OF THE DAY The final term of the Giants and Magpies elimination final could probably fit into every category here. The Western Sydney hosts looked set for elimination from the post-season at the first time of asking after trailing by up to six goals in the concluding stanza. After missing out on a double chance by a single goal - also at home - last week, it would have been a galling way for the Giants to end their campaign. But they came from the clouds, scoring seven of the last ten goals of the game to hit the front. When Collingwood popped one in to level the game at 51 apiece with 17 seconds to go, they still needed a huge play. A turnover, meanwhile, could be fatal. Enter Susan Pettitt. From the restart, she received the pass and threw long to the goal mouth where towering shooter Kristina Brice took a strong catch, turned, and sealed the win. Check it out. Clutch. It earned a spot in next weekend’s Preliminary Final against the Melbourne Vixens, who were upset by the Sunshine Coast in the major semi-final earlier in the afternoon. TODAY’S BIG WINNER When GWS started their AFL journey it was largely with noses turned up from the traditional football centres. They were manufactured. Plastic. In a city that doesn’t care about the code. You get the picture. It wasn’t nice. Well, today, in their sixth season, they have topped the ladder for the first time. Cop that. A glut of early injuries made going slow to begin the season, threatening to stop their premiership tilt before it started. But their classy win against the Essendon today capped a wonderful month of footy where they have made a habit of winning the close one. Here, they showed they had another club in the bag too: putting away the opposition. While Essendon were gallant, bringing the margin to single digits in the last term at one stage, GWS held their nerve and ran out the game despite a six day break and returning from Perth last weekend. That’s what real contenders do: find a way to win and win well even when it’s hard. And kick the ball beautifully. They do that too. TODAY’S BIG LOSER Sneaking ahead before half time, the Gold Coast Titans were well placed to push hard for an away win in Townsville against the Cowboys. After, they didn’t get a sniff. Indeed, from leading the game at the break they didn’t score again, to be thrashed 20-8. What a mess. COMEBACK OF THE DAY It was only a two point deficit at the break that Richmond had to overcome against North, but it was a lot more than that too. North had won seven of the last right at the Tigers, the previous time by 70 points. The Kangaroos have been in very good nick over the last five weeks, too. Not to mention Richmond’s nagging habit - last Saturday aside - of finding ways to lose the unlosable. The primary issue there: letting it become close to begin with in games they otherwise dominated. Not tonight. Piling on six goals in the third term, then kicking away in the final quarter, Richmond go to bed in the top four. They deserve to sleep well and enjoy the week off. Richmond haven’t won a final since 2001, but it is performances like tonight that can give their loyal faithful belief that this is the year they break that hoodoo. At a minimum. Then? Who knows. IF TODAY WERE A SONG Speaking of Richmond. The man they call Dusty was best on ground. Again. He firms as Brownlow favourite. He’s also a person of interest to, reportedly, multiple clubs at the end of this season. To the extent that North Melbourne supporters were seen with banners urging the superstar to join them. After play when asked about his growing currency on the open market, Martin joked that it was a good result. I stress to Tiger readers: he was having a laugh. But still, Undercover Mart(i)n, based on that exchange alone, works if you ask me. Enjoy. Go with it.

Via AAP. A Dustin Martin masterclass has propelled Richmond to a 35-point win over North Melbourne at Etihad Stadium. The Tigers superstar was brilliant throughout but elevated his game even higher in a blistering six-goals-to-one third-quarter that set up the 14.17 (101) to 9.12 (66) win on Saturday night. If Martin is the target of a North Melbourne free agency poaching raid, as has been widely reported, the Kangaroos will need to up their offer on the evidence of his 38-possession, two-goal game. North couldn’t combat the bullocking midfielder’s trademark strength, but Martin also wowed the 36,100-strong crowd with breathtaking disposal by foot. As good as the Tigers were in the pivotal third term, the Roos were equally bad. Brad Scott’s side imploded with three 50m penalties and a free kick gifting Richmond scores as they turned a two-point half-time deficit into a decisive 28-point lead at three-quarter time.

The Force are third in the Australian conference and will be encouraged by the Waratah’s loss earlier today; they can join them on points by winning this evening. The Hurricanes are second in the NZ conference and bound for the post-season. Both teams won their previous encounter, but the ‘Canes have a 9-1 record against the Force in their last ten starts. Indeed, they have won 12 on the spin against non-Kiwi opposition. The Force will be determined to show something for their home fans, though.

Then joked that his Best On Ground performance wasn’t a bad outcome given clubs are after him. Brilliant subplot to season 2017, that one.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.53am EDT 07:53 NRL: And the Cowboys impressive comeback over the Titans in Townsville. Maroons utility Michael Morgan helped put the disappointment of a State of Origin opening loss behind him by guiding North Queensland to a much-needed 20-8 home NRL win on Saturday night over Gold Coast. With Cowboys captain Johnathan Thurston still sidelined, Townsville junior Morgan played arguably his best game of the season, the halfback bagging a try and impressing with his kicking game all night. Opposing Origin star Jarryd Hayne had a largely forgettable night, the Blues’ centre barely noticeable in a Titans side needing some attacking spark. Outside of a 10-minute period up to halftime, the Titans struggled and were outscored 14-0 in the final term to slip to another listless loss. North Queensland looked promising in attack and enjoyed 65 per cent of possession in the opening 20 minutes but couldn’t finish a number of half chances against resolute Gold Coast defence. After a mountain of pressure and possession, the Cowboys were finally rewarded when Morgan powered over for a signature running try. Winger Kyle Feldt missed an easy conversion attempt but, soon after, a penalty goal took North Queensland to 6-0 nearing halftime. The Titans were then quick to pounce on a Cowboys error, as Dale Copley combined with Ash Taylor to send the Titans’ halfback over for an impressive 50-metre try. While a stellar Lachlan Coote tackle stopped a certain Gold Coast try, a ruck penalty allowed Taylor to boot the Titans to an unlikely 8-6 halftime lead. North Queensland started the second period with great attacking intent and were soon rewarded when standout rookie Coen Hess stormed over for his ninth try of the year to recapture the lead for the Cowboys. Feldt added another penalty goal to extend the Cowboys’ lead to six and he added four more points shortly after with a smart finish from an inch-perfect Morgan cut-out pass. The Cowboys went out further to 20-8 lead after the Titans gifted Feldt a penalty shot from in front when they failed to get a line dropout away in time.

The Brumbies have clinched Super Rugby’s Australian conference with a 32-3 bonus-point thrashing of the hapless Melbourne Rebels in Canberra. Saturday night’s four-tries-to-one victory means the Brumbies head into the June international break assured of playing finals for the fifth year running. Heavy dew made things difficult for players on Saturday night with both sides making handling errors throughout the match. Despite the slippery conditions, the Brumbies had no problem illustrating the gulf in class between Australia’s best and worst performed franchises this season in front of a 8,970 supporters at GIO Stadium. The Brumbies controlled a scrappy first half and went to the break leading 11-3. Winger Henry Speight took a quick tap from a penalty on the half hour mark and drew a slew of defenders as he attempted to dive over under the posts. Two phases later Kyle Godwin found Jordan Smiler out wide, with the No. 8 breaking a 25-game try drought and scoring the only five-pointer of the first half. The home side made a dream start to the second period with outside centre Tevita Kurindrani bullocking his way through the Rebels’ defence to score under the posts, and Wharenui Hawera added the points to extend the lead to 15. A brilliant run from flanker Chris Alcock just before the hour mark gave halfback Joe Powell the chance to set up Hawera who crossed under the posts before converting his own try to take the Brumbies to a 25-3 lead. A dashing break from winger Marika Koroibete late in the second half produced the Rebels best chance for a try, but he was denied by Tom Banks and Kyle Godwin metres from the line. Nigel Ah Wong dived on a loose ball to score the final try of the game in the dying minutes to cap a dominant Brumbies performance. Hawera notched both his penalty goal attempts while Reece Hodge scored the Rebels’ only points of the match with a long-range penalty goal mid way through the first half.

The report from a ridiculous first-semi final in Western Sydney, the Giants getting over the line inside the final 12 seconds. Giants Netball have produced an extraordinary final assault to overcome Collingwood Magpies 52-51 in a Super Netball minor semi-final nailbiter on Saturday night. The Giants looked set for a season-ending loss when they trailed the Magpies by six goals with seven minutes remaining at the Sydney Olympic Park Sports Centre. However, the team that have battled without injured captain Kim Green since round five staged a courageous rally to score seven of the last 10 goals of the game. The decisive moment came with 17 seconds remaining and the scores locked at 51-51, when veteran Susan Pettitt threw a long pass into the circle where goal shooter Kristina Brice gained the ball and held her nerve to sink the winner.

Cameron has another chance to extend the lead, a set shot from where the 50 meets the boundary line, but can’t thread it through, missing - just - to the near side. The spearhead is now equal leader in the Coleman after his goal moments earlier. Kelly misses another shot, albeit a chancier swing from outside the 50. Still: they’re once again peppering. One more should do it. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.52am EDT 04:52 AFL: Q4 17:30 remaining. Giants 16.5 (101) v Dons 11.10 (82). Plenty of noise from the travelling Essendon fans, the Bombers chant audible around the ground. Giants have been good in close games with a string of single-digit victories, including an eight point triumph over the Eagles in Perth last week. But how much will that hurt now? (Nearly) the longest trip in footy, and all that, on a six day break. Oh, but Jeremy Cameron is having none of that! The star forward latches onto the contested ball in the pocket, composes himself and snaps truly. An old-fashioned steadier, right there.

(File photo) After facing criticism on the placement of "annoying" ads on websites, Google is now going ahead with its ad-blocking plans and will add a feature to its Chrome browser that will block advertisements which do not meet company standards, a media report said. Google has confirmed that it intends to add a new feature to its Chrome web browser that will block certain types of ads from being seen by users and in some cases could block all the ads on websites that do not meet certain standards, Fortune reported. The company said that it wants to work with publishers to help them understand what kinds of ads will no longer be acceptable. The Tech And Auto Show On CNN-News18 | SAT 7:30PM And SUN 1:30PM Chrome will now include ad-blocking features that are turned on by default. Ads that meet certain annoying criteria will not be shown and if a website crosses a certain threshold of substandard ads, users won't see any ads, the report said. Some of the ad types that will be blocked include pop-ups, videos that auto-play, and so-called "pre-stitial" ads that force readers to sit through a countdown before they can see the page's contents. Since many leading publishers rely on some or all of these strategies to boost ad revenue, Google will allow them to show users a note when their ads are blocked by third-party software. The note will give readers the option of either disabling their blocker or buying an ad-free pass or subscription of some kind for that site, the report noted.

The Hollywood Reporter Movies TV Business Style Politics Tech Culture Awards Video Subscribe Newsletters Exec Suite June 02, 2017 11:26am PT by Eriq Gardner Viacom, Google on Same Copyright Page in Appellate Fight Over Music Licensing @VH1Classic/Twitter The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hears arguments whether the Justice Department is right to bar BMI from issuing fractional licenses. The U.S. Justice Department's decision last year to require "full-works licensing" by public performance outlets ASCAP and BMI may have the music industry warning that certain groups of songwriters might no longer be able to collaborate with each other, but it's managed to unite two old copyright foes, Viacom and Google. ASCAP and BMI are currently litigating the DOJ's new position that 100 percent licensing of song compositions is required under consent decrees made in the 1940s to settle an antitrust investigation. The prospect how this might interfere with relationships in music — where multiple authors often work together on joint works before assigning co-ownership shares to different entities — has landed in court in more ways than one. Last September, U.S. District Court Judge Louis Stanton handed BMI a victory by rejecting the DOJ's position that consent decrees don't bar the issuance of fractional licenses. History will show that Stanton is the same judge that presided over the long war between Viacom and Google over what was uploaded to YouTube during the video site's early days. That case eventually settled. Now, both Viacom and Google have signed on to the same amicus brief challenging Stanton's music licensing decision at the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. They are not alone. The amicus brief also features Netflix, Spotify and, among others, the American Beverage Licensees — the place to go for both Bacardi and Mast-Jaegermeister.  The group tells the 2nd Circuit that it needn't be concerned with the possibility of song co-owners breaching contracts among themselves by licensing a work without the other co-owners' consent. What's important, they say, is "the nature of a joint work, the plain language of the decree, and the consequences of disrupting the decree’s careful balancing of pro- and anti-competitive effects." As for specific concerns, the audiovisual content providers — Netflix, Viacom, etc. — express worry about being put into a disadvantageous position when video works with incorporated music land in their hands. "If BMI engaged in fractional licensing, co-owners of split works could continue to withhold performance rights at the outset and effectively deprive the downstream exhibitor of license coverage for already-produced content unless the exhibitor took licenses at whatever fee the rights holder might charge. The exhibitor would be forced to engage with the rights holders at a time when it has no option but to use the music already in the can. The major publishers recognize the inordinate market power this timing issue gives them." Google has similar anxiety because it runs a digital music service and doesn't like the idea of multiple, overcomplicated negotiations. The brief talks about the prospect of rights holders potentially using hold-up opportunities and withdrawing from BMI and ASCAP and forming new PROs. "This problem is exacerbated for the radio and digital music industries because record labels typically release sound recordings for airplay weeks or months before the ownership of the compositions embodied in those recordings is made known (or even determined)," states the brief. "Moreover, there are often extended disputes about who controls the rights to compositions. For example, the hit 'Uptown Funk' originally had six credited songwriters before a dispute resulted in 10 getting credit." Here's the full amicus brief. There's 10 lawyers here, and while we don't know who deserves credit for the authorship, it's signed by Kenneth Steinthal at King & Spalding.

We’re not in the business of punishing people for getting on,” he said. “On the contrary, we want people to keep more of their earnings. The only way they can be sure their taxes won’t rise is to vote Conservative.” But during a campaign presser in West Yorkshire this morning, May refused to echo Fallon’s claims. “Our plans on tax have been set up in the manifesto, we are a party that believe in low taxes … when people come to vote they know they have a choice between a party that has always believed in lower taxes and a Labour party whose manifesto we know will cost ordinary working people,” she said. In response, Corbyn has said the Tories are in “chaos” over their tax plans. “One minister says they’re going to give no more tax rises, indeed possibly tax reductions, for the very wealthiest; then they can’t answer the question about tax rises for the rest of the population; then they can’t answer the questions about funding social care”. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Fallon’s comments showed the Tories were the party for “the few, not the many”, and the Lib Dem former business secretary Sir Vince Cable said they indicated that the Tories would raise national insurance instead. During the same campaign stop in Lincoln on Saturday, Jeremy Corbyn promised to protect Britain from global threats after facing criticism for refusing to say whether he would launch a retaliatory nuclear strike. The Labour leader suggested he would sign off on more ships for the Navy and extra surveillance aircraft for the RAF alongside pledges to boost funding and numbers in the police and armed services. “We will protect the people of this country from any threat that they face anywhere in the world,” he said. Meanwhile, Iain Duncan Smith was on the Today programme to defend May’s refusal to debate with Corbyn, maintaining that debates didn’t change opinion. The former Labour leader Ed Miliband refuted this, stating: “I think that debates and opportunities to speak to the public do have an effect, particularly for leaders of the opposition.” Miliband also said Corbyn’s was a “more radical” manifesto but that “it’s a manifesto I’m proud to be associated with”. While Nicola Sturgeon told voters they have a “golden opportunity” to end austerity across the UK, Ruth Davidson said the election was the last chance to avoid a second independence referendum. “Thursday’s election is the last chance we’ll have to stop Nicola Sturgeon in her tracks,” she said. We’re closing the liveblog now, but keep up to speed with our news reports as the next 24 hours promise to be significant in the campaign.

Read more Updated at 9.49am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.21am EDT 09:21 Labour and Lib Dems attack Tory tax 'chaos' Jeremy Corbyn has claimed the Conservatives’ tax plans are in “chaos” after Theresa May failed to back a senior minister who said higher earners will not face an income tax hike under a new Tory government. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said voting Conservative in the General Election on Thursday was “the only way” people could be sure income tax would not go up. His comments went further than the party’s manifesto, which said they would keep taxes “low” but did not rule out a rise in income tax. Campaigning in West Yorkshire, the prime minister declined to be drawn on his comments, saying only it was their “firm intention” to reduce taxes for ordinary families. She said: “Our position on tax hasn’t changed. We have set it out in the manifesto. It is our firm intention to reduce taxes for ordinary working families.” Her comments were seized on by Corbyn, who said the Conservative leadership was in disarray. “I think there’s complete chaos going on at the top of the Government,” he said during a campaign visit to Lincoln. “One minister says they’re going to give no more tax rises, indeed possibly tax reductions for the very wealthiest, then they can’t answer the question about tax rises for the rest of the population, then they can’t answer the questions about funding social care.” For the Liberal Democrats, former business minister Jo Swinson said: “The Conservatives are in utter mayhem over their tax policy.” The Conservative manifesto said there would be no increase in VAT but dropped David Cameron’s pledge not to raise income tax or national insurance contributions after Chancellor Philip Hammond complained that it limited his room for manoeuvre. However, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Fallon made it clear that income tax “absolutely” would not rise under a re-elected Tory government. Asked if high earners could confidently vote Conservative next week, safe in the knowledge that their income tax would not go up, Sir Michael said: “Yes. “You’ve seen our record. We’re not in the business of punishing people for getting on, on the contrary we want people to keep more of their earnings. The only way they can be sure their taxes won’t rise is to vote Conservative. We already know your tax will go up if you vote Labour on Thursday.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.17am EDT 09:17 More from Scotland now, where Ruth Davidson is seeing the election less as a “golden opportunity” (13:42) and instead as the last chance to avoid a second independence referendum. “Thursday’s election is the last chance we’ll have to stop Nicola Sturgeon in her tracks,” The Scottish Conservative leader said. “It’s our last opportunity to have our say, make Nicola Sturgeon listen for once - and stop her second referendum. “Come Friday morning, once we’ve cast our vote, we all know what she will try to do. She’ll try to use the result to push her demand for that second referendum.” She urged all voters to back the Scottish Conservatives to stop the SNP. The party leader said: “I’m not asking you to agree with me on everything. I just want us to come together on this one big thing - to stop the SNP in their tracks. “This election isn’t about deciding whether you’re Tory, or Labour, or Lib Dem. It’s about sending Nicola Sturgeon a message. And by voting for me and my team, we can do just that. “So - Thursday is the last chance we’ll have to shout out loud and clear what we think of Nicola Sturgeon’s plans. Only a vote for the Scottish Conservatives will make her listen.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.05am EDT 09:05 Corbyn challenged on nuclear deterrent, again At a campaign stop in Lincoln on Saturday, Jeremy Corbyn promised to protect Britain from global threats after facing criticism for refusing to say whether he would launch a retaliatory nuclear strike. The Labour leader suggested he would sign off on more ships for the Navy and extra surveillance aircraft for the RAF alongside pledges to boost funding and numbers in the police and armed services. It comes after Corbyn came under tough interrogation over his attitude to nuclear weapons during Friday’s BBC Question Time leaders special. He has repeatedly been asked throughout the campaign about whether he would “push the button”. Corbyn speaks to a group of pensioners at Age UK in Lincoln, during a General Election campaign event in Lincoln. Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/PA Labour officially backs the renewal of Britian’s nuclear deterrent, but Corbyn has spoken against the move in the past. After hosting a roundtable with pensioners in Lincoln, Corbyn was asked if he would keep the British people safe as prime minister. The Labour leader replied: “We will protect the people of this country from any threat that they face anywhere in the world. He went on: We will invest properly in our police service, we will invest properly in our armed services, the numbers in the armed services have gone down, the Navy are crying out for more ships, the Air Force are crying out for more surveillance aircraft. We would fund them properly to achieve all of that. We would also face up to the terrible danger of cyber attacks against our society, look what happened to the NHS only two weeks ago, and we will deal with the issue of the terrorist threat which is obviously appalling. What happened in Manchester was dreadful beyond belief, the way you deal with that is putting more police on the streets - we will put 10,000 more police on the streets, the Conservatives are taking 20,000 off the streets. We will fund the security services to monitor people and protect them, but also our strategy is to bring communities together.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.42am EDT 08:42 Sturgeon urges end to austerity Nicola Sturgeon, who spent much of the morning in a helicopter (see 10:56), has been telling voters they have a “golden opportunity” to end austerity across the UK. The Scottish first minister said the poll on June 8 will give people the chance to say “enough is enough” and urged them to back her party, saying “now more than ever it is vital that we have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland”. She said: The Tories’ austerity agenda has failed on every count - not only has it choked off the economic recovery but the years of underinvestment have put huge pressure on public services across the UK. We simply can’t go on with more of the same but that is exactly what the Tories are planning to do - and this snap election has presented a golden opportunity for voters across Scotland to say enough is enough. With polls tightening across the UK, the votes of people across Scotland could determine the size of Theresa May’s majority in the next parliament.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.28am EDT 08:28 Nigel Farage has said he felt “a degree of vindication” after hearing that prosecutors had brought charges against Craig Mackinlay, the Conservative candidate who defeated him in South Thanet in 2015. The former Ukip leader told the Press Association: I was very upset two years ago at the circumstances and what took place in that seat. I never complained, I never said anything in public about it but I did feel, with the Crown Prosecution yesterday deciding to prosecute three people, a degree of vindication. Yesterday it emerged Mackinlay will face court after the election over allegations relating to election spending in his battle with Farage, but insists he is confident he will be cleared and will continue to campaign for re-election as the Kent constituency’s MP. After the charges against him and two Tory officials were announced, he received the backing of Theresa May, who said: “The Conservative Party continues to believe that these allegations are unfounded. Craig Mackinlay is innocent until proven guilty and he remains our candidate.” But Farage claimed the charges reflected “badly” on the PM and said if he was running the party he would have told Mackinlay that he could not stand but would bring him back if he was found innocent.

After hosting a roundtable with pensioners in Lincoln, the Labour leader told reporters: I think there’s complete chaos going on at the top of the government. One minister says they’re going to give no more tax rises, indeed possibly tax reductions, for the very wealthiest; then they can’t answer the question about tax rises for the rest of the population; then they can’t answer the questions about funding social care. Let’s be clear – what Labour are offering is no tax rises or national insurance rises or VAT rises for 95% of the population.

We’re not in the business of punishing people for getting on,” he said. “On the contrary, we want people to keep more of their earnings. The only way they can be sure their taxes won’t rise is to vote Conservative.” But during a campaign presser in West Yorkshire this morning, May refused to echo Fallon’s claims. “Our plans on tax have been set up in the manifesto, we are a party that believe in low taxes … when people come to vote they know they have a choice between a party that has always believed in lower taxes and a Labour party whose manifesto we know will cost ordinary working people,” she said. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Fallon’s comments showed the Tories were the party for “the few, not the many”, and the Lib Dem former business secretary Sir Vince Cable said they indicated that the Tories would raise national insurance instead. Meanwhile, Iain Duncan Smith was on the Today programme to defend May’s refusal to debate with Corbyn, maintaining that debates didn’t change opinion. The former Labour leader Ed Miliband refuted this, stating: “I think that debates and opportunities to speak to the public do have an effect, particularly for leaders of the opposition.” Miliband also said Corbyn’s was a “more radical” manifesto but that “it’s a manifesto I’m proud to be associated with”.

While Google has long offered a way to block pop-ups in Chrome, it’s never been a feature that's been very easy to find. To turn it on you’ll need to dig deep into the settings, and most people who use the browser probably don’t even know it’s there. But now Google is finally getting serious about annoying ads. And that includes their own. In a blog post, Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior vice president of ads and commerce, outlined the company’s new strategy for dealing with ads as part of an effort to build “a better web for everyone.” He explains that Google has joined the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group that also includes Facebook, News Corp, and Unilever, to “provide clear, public, data-driven guidance for how the industry can improve ads for consumers.” And that starts with the way Chrome displays ads. As Ramaswamy explains, “In dialogue with the Coalition and other industry groups, we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018.” It’s unclear whether the new ad blocker would be an option that user could disable or a feature built into the Blink rendering engine that powers the browser. A separate report in The Wall Street Journal states that Google will give publishers “at least six months” to prepare for the change. In addition to filtering out rogue ads that degrade the experience, the publication says the setting will “prevent all ads from appearing on websites that are deemed to provide a bad advertising experience for users.” According to the Journal, Google is pitching the feature as more of a filter than a blocker, much like the pop-up window blocker that already exists in the browser. However, while users need to explicitly opt into that feature, the new ad blocker would be turned on by default for all users. The story behind the story: It’s no secret that Google is one of the richest companies in the world, and the majority of its revenue comes from ads. But while it might seem anti-competitive and a little shady for the biggest ad supplier in the world to be adding an ad blocker to its own browser, this could have good implications all around. Chrome users know that there are several ad-blocking extensions available in the Chrome web store, but most of them take an all-or-nothing approach, which obviously affects Google’s bottom line. By weeding out troublesome and burdensome ads, including those from the Google-run Ad Exchange, it could create a better experience for all, regardless of whether you already run an ad blocker. And it’s not just Chrome that could benefit from this push. As a member of the Coalition for Better Ads, Google is committing to improving the delivery and presentation of ads, something we can all agree is sorely needed.          LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Controls 22 Villages, Farms near Maskan in Eastern Aleppo Homs: Army Forces Claim More Territory in Syria's Desert Iraqi Volunteer Forces Capture Ba'aj West of Mosul from ISIL Iraqis Leave Zanjili Neighborhood as Security Forces Continue Fighting ISIL in Western Mosul Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Pounding ISIL with Rockets in Syrian Border Region Syria: Army Soldiers Recapture Maskana's Water Pumping Station in Eastern Aleppo 7 Dead, 48 Injured in London Attacks Damascus: Inside Syrian Army's Tank Factory US-Backed Militants Take Control of Syria's 3rd largest Dam as Kurds Allow ISIL to Withdraw from Raqqa Syrian Soldiers Expel ISIL from Aleppo; Maskana Freed Envoy: Iran to Continue Supporting Syria in Anti-Terror Fight Iran Condemns Terrorist Attack in UK Iran Warns Against Terrorist Plots to Undermine Security in Region Iran: Paris Deal Withdrawal Shows US Irresponsibility Towards Int'l Community Dara'a: Syrian Army Kills Tens of Al-Nusra Terrorists, 3 Commanders Syrian Army Controls 22 Villages, Farms near Maskan in Eastern Aleppo TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian army managed to capture 22 villages and farms near Maskana and eventually forced the ISIL terrorists to retreat from its last stronghold in Aleppo province, the town of Maskana, towards Raqqa province.

However, Home was only available in the US at first. It came to the UK later, but America's neighbor to the north was left hanging. Not anymore—Google Home launches in Canada on June 26th. Home will understand both English (the kind with extra "ehs" and "sorrys," I guess) and Canadian French when it launches later this month. The feature set appears to be the same, so many smart home devices and services will work with Google Home out of the box. Pre-orders are live at the Google Store and Best Buy Canada. It looks like the price will be $179.99. It will be for sale at plenty of other retailers on launch day, including Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Staples, The Source, Telus, Visions, and Walmart.

Google Photos will now suggest photos to archive Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 3:44pm PDTJun 2, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 50 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares134 Applications News Google Photos has become a very convenient way to back up all your photos... all of them. Even all the receipts, addresses, and other junk. Google recently added archiving to get that stuff out of the main timeline, but now it's going a step further by suggesting photos to archive. It sounds like the feature we spotted in a recent APK Teardown. The suggestions will appear as a card in the Assistant tab inside Photos. Google will use its machine learning magic to figure out what's in the photo, marking potentially unimportant ones for archiving. You then have the chance to evaluate the selections before proceeding, so you won't accidentally sweep up any important pics. New! See suggestions for photos to archive, so you can move photos you don’t want to see in your main library. See ya later, receipts 👋 pic.twitter.com/RpjBquGN5G — Google Photos (@googlephotos) June 2, 2017 Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. All the images you archive will remain in albums and search results. They're just more out of the way. This feature is still rolling out, so give it time. Manual archiving is already available, though. Tags apps Google google+ photos photos subscribe ...

Mine is automatically turned on when I just checked it right now. needa Nothing for me. DP2 XL needa I have thousands duplicate type photos. I seriously hope it advises me to archive all of them. I have been waiting for Google to do something like this for a while now. Maybe if I can get rid of all the clutter, I can stick stuff in albums and clean it all up. Mustafa Selçuk Öztürk I got the update and it shows under Assistant Cards, but no suggestion yet. Waiting patiently... myssi it must be processing your photos brkshr This archiving feature is a godsend!!! My wedding and my honeymoon tour of 7 national parks takes up at least a third of the photo's I have saved from the past 15 years or so. I already archived about half of my wedding photo's. Now I just need to get through the metric ton of honeymoon photo's I have of nature and driving and it will be much easier to find the important photo's. Dennis Ulijn It's also important to solve this problem from the other end: start realizing which photos matter to you. Nature pictures? Architectural pictures? Portraits, group pictures? Nature and architecture are abundant, I just try to shoot the people I'm with, mostly spontaneously or without the knowing because I want to capture the moment. I don't have to archive many photos, and I do take a lot of pictures of my kids. abc Some people like nature more than people. :) Besides, the easiest solution is not take any pics at all because someone else in the group will do it and share them with you. Dennis Ulijn I doubt my toddlers will take a good picture ;-) well, to each their own. Sometimes avoiding the problem is simpler than solving it. Lourdesdcruz Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Facts Cool feature Erstam I wish they would adopt a folder and sub folder like structure. I would still much rather organize my photos that way. It suggested i archive all my screen shots. Meh. Rudder2 JunkMail I agree with you. I hate Google Photos' organization and use Google Drive instead because I like organizing my photos with folders and subfolders. Another beef with Google Photos is it doesn't recognize my Google Drive Photo folders as albums. Google has a lot to learn how people like to organize photos. The Google Drive help line tried to get me to switch to Google Photos and I gave him an ear load. I spend hours organizing my photos on my computer and Google just doesn't care and wants us to do it again in their app. Anon They need to let us archive entire folders automatically, like the whatsapp image folder Vlad > Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. No it's not. This is EXACTLY how it works in Gmail and how I count on it to work. Everything is still categorised, it's just not there when opening gmail.com Cakefish This is completely unrelated to the article but I'm getting very impatient waiting for Motorola and Nokia to reveal their 2017 phones. Do you have any news on release dates for us AP? DynamikD I'm glad about this feature. Great way to hide photos that you may not want to people to view. I don't quite understand why people still complain about not being able to create folders though. It's an archaic way of doing things. That's why you can create albums within photos. Serves the same function but it leverages meta data which is more efficient and makes searching for photos and videos easier within the app. Yuri Vidal if google photos would only give me the option to NOT BACKUP my screenshots... i hate it! (Samsung stores screenshots under /DCIM/Screenshots so, google photos thinks they are pictures and uploads them. There is no way to unselect this folder, since it is a subfolder of the pitures folder... PLEASE FIX THIS! Ozl This is just great! i have a lot of files being uploaded on wifi from whatsapp and some i forget to delete, and others are just there just in case, so yes, Thanks Google! Fruity101079 I thought this archive function was useless, and it is for me, but when i see your comments, i guess i was wrong. It seems to be useful to a lot of you who didn't take time to organize and arrange your photos.

These blockers threaten websites that rely on digital ads for revenue. Google's version will allow ads as long as websites follow industry-created guidelines and minimize certain types of ads that consumers really hate. That includes pop-up ads, huge ads that don't go away when visitors scroll down a page and video ads that start playing automatically with the sound on. Google says the feature will be turned on by default, and users can turn it off. It'll work on both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome.Google says that even ads it sells will be blocked on websites that don't get rid of annoying types of ads. But there might not be vast changes online triggered by the popular browser's efforts. It's a "small number of websites that are disproportionately responsible for annoying user experiences," Google spokeswoman Suzanne Blackburn said. "I'm sure there are some publishers who will get hurt," said Brian Wieser, an ad analyst with Pivotal Research Group. But in the long term, he says, cracking down on irritating ads should make the internet experience better, encouraging people to visit sites and click on links. That, in turn, benefits Google. The company is also starting a program that could help publishers deal with users who have downloaded popular ad blockers. Some individual websites have come up with their own countermeasures. Forbes.com, for example, won't let you read stories without disabling your ad blocker or logging in with Facebook or Google accounts, so the site can track you. Google would work with websites to set up messages telling users to disable their blockers for the site or pay for a version of it with no ads. It'll take a 10 percent cut of those payments. To protect its ad business, Google has tried to improve user experiences in other ways. It launched a way for websites to load faster on phones. And it used its sway as the dominant search engine to push companies to make their sites mobile-friendly. Such sites show up higher in mobile searches. Google also has tried to address advertisers' concerns about their ads running next to offensive content by banning its ads from some objectionable videos on YouTube, like those that promote discrimination or advocate illegal drug use. Google also won't place its ads on web pages with objectionable content - porn, for example, and or sites that promote suicide or violence. Facebook, too, is trying to make links from inside its universe less spammy for users. It says it's trying to cut down on posts and ads in the news feed that lead to junky pages with "little substantive content" and "disruptive, shocking or malicious ads."

A lot of Google’s revenue comes from its online advertisements, but that business is being threatened by the rise in usage of ad blockers. Blockers come in the form of extensions so you don’t even have to install new software, just add the mod to your browser. Major ad publishers have realised that a major reason for the popularity of these ad blockers is because of how annoying some of the, can be. From the autoplaying videos, to the gigantic banners that block have the webpage, there’s nothing more annoying than an ad trying to aggressively force you to view its content before you get to what you want.  Google understands this and, in 2016, it joined with the likes of Facebook, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, The Washington Post and major advertising groups to form a union called the Coalition for Better Ads. The idea was to find a balance between ads that make money and don’t annoy the viewer. Now, Google has revealed just what it plans to do to help enforce this standard of advertising. "We plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads standards starting in early 2018,” Google’s senior VP of ads and commerce Sridhar Ramaswamy said in a blog post. It’s a bold step for Google to take, considering it has one of the biggest ad distribution platforms online. However, the move does show that even Google is worried about how far online ads may go, given the current trend. Ads liable to be blocked include those that autoplay videos with sound, pop-ups, ones that cover the web content until a timer counts down, and large ads that cover the page even when you scroll. On mobile devices, the list also includes ads that cover more than 30 percent of the screen as well as ones that flash.

Here's how Google disables Burger King's ad after it hijacked Google Assistant Is Google's eagerness to answer questions promoting more falsehood online? After facing criticism on the placement of "annoying" ads on websites, Google is now going ahead with its ad-blocking plans and will add a feature to its Chrome browser that will block advertisements which do not meet company standards, a media report said. Google has confirmed that it intends to add a new feature to its Chrome web browser that will block certain types of ads from being seen by users and in some cases could block all the ads on websites that do not meet certain standards, Fortune reported. The company said that it wants to work with publishers to help them understand what kinds of ads will no longer be acceptable. Chrome will now include ad-blocking features that are turned on by default. Ads that meet certain annoying criteria will not be shown and if a website crosses a certain threshold of substandard ads, users won't see any ads, the report said. Some of the ad types that will be blocked include pop-ups, videos that auto-play, and so-called "pre-stitial" ads that force readers to sit through a countdown before they can see the page's contents. Since, many leading publishers rely on some or all of these strategies to boost ad revenue, Google will allow them to show users a note when their ads are blocked by third-party software. The note will give readers the option of either disabling their blocker or buying an ad-free pass or subscription of some kind for that site, the report noted.

The feature is said to be designed to help publishers who fear for their slumping ad revenue. A new extension called “Funding Choices” provides the publisher with the tool to embed into their website. When a user with an ad blocker visits the site, he is prompted to either to make a payment to remove the ads on the site, or to disable the ad blocker and proceed. Choosing neither of the options means one cannot view the website. The company is said to receive 10 percent of the fee, which will be set by a publisher individually.

The annoying ads like pop-up windows or auto-playing videos “can lead some people to block all ads—taking a big toll on the content creators, journalists, web developers and videographers who depend on ads to fund their content creation,” Google’s senior vice president for ads and commerce, Sridhar Ramaswamy, says. He added that ad blockers have a negative impact on potential revenue across all of Google properties, particularly in Europe. What is Google's anti-adblocking fighting?

The internet search giant is also expected to introduce its own blocker next year, which will be switched on by default in the new version of Google Chrome. Despite the tool is said to block all “unacceptable” ads, it is described as a “filter” by default, i.e. selective in blocking the ads. Identified by the Coalition for Better Ads, “unacceptable” ads are the ones making the users avoid online adverts in the first place.

Other reactions revealed some people would rather switch Chrome for another browser or boycott the anti-ad blocking sites altogether rather than watch the unwanted ads or pay for not having to watch them.

The project is the latest example of Silicon Valley attempting to reshape how goods and people are moved. But some say it also underscores a penchant for tech moguls to colour their projects with seemingly virtuous ambition. Tell a friend A lot of work goes into building an airship. Inset: Sergey Brin.Picture: AP Some people on social media seized on the vessel's apparent dual purpose. On the one hand, it's a benevolent carrier transporting food to remote, hard-pressed communities, and on the other it's a luxurious "air yacht," as the Guardian report described it, shuttling a billionaire and his inner circle to exotic locations. Google declined to comment. The vessel is reportedly being built at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. When completed, the airship will become the world's largest aircraft at about 650 feet long, although its payload is not known, according to the Guardian. Plans for the vessel, which is being funded by Brin, were first reported by Bloomberg earlier this year. Read also: Tracking down Silicon Valley's tech touchstones Experts say that the use of airships could bypass the congestion and costs tied to transporting cargo via roads, railways and airports. But lighter-than-air travel presents its own challenges, like the need to steady the aircraft by offsetting the weight of cargo once it's offloaded. According to the Guardian, Brin's vessel will use a series of internal bladders to stabilize its flight. Brin began his plans to build the vessel about three years ago, according to Bloomberg. His fascination with airships was sparked by visits to the Ames Research Center, next to the headquarters of Google's parent company, Alphabet. Ames once housed the navy airship USS Macon, which spanned about 784 feet and was among the largest aircraft of its time in the 1930s. Silicon Valley's novel charitable efforts have been criticized in the past, perhaps most prominently in the case of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's internet.org initiative, which aims to bring Internet access to the billions of people who don't have it. With altruistic motives but lucrative business prospects, some see Zuckerberg's initiative less as a magnanimous Internet project than as a version of high-tech imperialism. It's unclear whether Brin's airship will be put to commercial use. But Larry Page, CEO of Alphabet and the other co-founder of Google, has also taken a keen interest in innovative aircraft. Page has personally backed two flying-car start-ups, Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero. Kitty Hawk's flyer, a personal electric aircraft that hovers over water, will be available for purchase later this year.

Of course, the search giant isn’t actually calling the upcoming feature an ad-blocker, since it functions more like an ad filter. That’s because Chrome’s new powers will only eliminate bad ads which are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards. This includes intrusive autoplaying videos that play music and invasive pop-ups. Google apparently isn’t sparing itself from this new regime, stating in a blog post that it intends to block its own ads if they don’t play nice with the aforementioned standards. The move can be seen as a strike against ad-blocking software, pre-empting third-party apps by providing its own solution. Also See: Google rolls out fix for annoying page jumps in Chrome Ad-blockers usually remove all ads on a page, so Google’s way allows publishers to generate revenue from ‘good’ advertisements without turning off readers who don’t want to be attacked with frustrating ads. The brand’s additionally launched a new Ad Experience Report to help site owners determine whether the ads on their page lives up to its standards. Google’s also introduced a new Funding Choices beta program for publishers to develop alternative streams of income. They’ll be able to display a customized message to visitors who are using an ad-blocker, asking them to either allow ads or pay to get rid of them via Google Contributor. Google Contributor has been around for roughly 2 years now. It hasn’t exactly set the internet on fire, so it remains to be seen whether it’ll catch on now.

(Make your mind up will you?) Going from Apple-powered devices to Google's platform is either ridiculously easy or rather taxing, depending on your current setup. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Do you Google? Good news if you're already heavily invested in the Google ecosystem on your iPhone. You can switch to Android in an hour or two and keep your evening free for seeing friends or browsing Netflix. Otherwise, better cancel those evening plans. Those of you who spend all your time in Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Maps for iOS can simply install those apps on your brand new Android device, sign in using your Google account credentials, and pick up where you left off. The same applies for Google Photos and Google Drive. Google Drive can handle contacts and calendars for you. Image: Google Unlike Apple, Google doesn't have a dedicated app to help you defect to its mobile OS, but it does have a website with a lot of the information you're going to need: essentially you're instructed to use Google Drive to copy over contacts, photos, videos and calendar entries, which we'll cover in more detail below. If you're thinking about switching from iOS to Android in the future, or like to swap mobile OSes on a regular basis, then Google's cloud-centric services make the task much easier — so your best off keeping all your data there. By contrast, the only official Apple app you can get on Android at the moment is Apple Music. Messages and emails Extricating yourself from iMessage is perhaps the biggest challenge facing those jumping ship to Android. iMessage doesn't work on Google's platform, and there's no way to export all your message history into a comparable Android app. You're going to have to say goodbye to iMessage, but you can at least ensure a clean break. As soon as you know you're making the move go into your iOS and navigate to Messages in Settings and turn iMessage off, then go to FaceTime in Settings and turn that off too. Apple's full instructions are here. If you have some precious iMessages or plain old SMSes you can't leave behind, you'll need to rely on third-party software and some rather convoluted processes to back it all up. iSMS2droid promises to import messages from an unencrypted backup you made in iTunes on your computer into Android. If you don't need the backup on your phone, then PhoneView (macOS) and CopyTrans (Windows) are two of many tools that will let you browse your old missives to your heart's content. It's goodbye to iMessage. Image: Screenshot As for emails, Apple's system supports IMAP, so you can carry on checking your iCloud emails through Gmail on Android if you're not having a fresh start and giving up your old email address completely. Tap the drop-down arrow on the Gmail app menu, choose Add account, and follow the configuration instructions provided by Apple. It's the same process if you're using any other kind of email app on your new Android device, like Outlook from Microsoft. The only requirement is that it supports the popular IMAP protocol. You have a couple of other options if putting your iCloud account directly into Gmail doesn't appeal. You can have all your Apple iCloud emails automatically forwarded to your new Gmail address, by going into iCloud Mail on the web and setting up forwarding — you can even delete the originals after they're passed on. Alternatively, you can export all your old emails using Mail on a Mac just in case you ever need them again, then close down your Apple account. Contacts and calendars As long as you just want to make a one-way, one-time switch from iOS to Android, then Google Drive for iOS makes the process of moving contacts and calendars over simple enough. Once you've got the app installed on your iOS device, open the menu then tap Settings and Backup. Choose the data you want to transfer across to the equivalent Google accounts, tap Start Backup and you're on your way — everything from iOS and iCloud gets picked up. Make sure you're on wi-fi, and the iPhone is plugged in during the switchover. Also note, that any previous backups you've done will be overwritten. macOS can help make switching calendars easier. Image: Screenshot If you want a two-way sync, which you might if you're using your Android phone with an Apple laptop, then it's a lot more complicated. The best option, really, is to switch to using Google contacts and calendars as much as you can, and then adding your Google account to the relevant apps in macOS (Add Account from the main app menu in both cases). Even then you need to make sure you're always adding events to the Google calendars (or contacts) and not the iCloud ones for them to show up on your phone. If you absolutely must keep both Google and iCloud services running concurrently, and syncing with each other, then you'll need to put your trust in a third-party app for macOS or Android. Photos and videos Since Google Photos came into the world it's actually pretty easy to get all your personal photos and videos moved over to Android, via Google's servers, as long as they're all still on your iPhone: Install Google Photos for iOS, opt to back everything up, and away you go. You can either pay Google for storage and keep everything at full resolution, or accept some resizing (images max out at 16 MP, videos at 1080p), and store as many photos and videos as you like on the web, free of charge. The process is even more straightforward if you use the Google Drive app as we described in the section above, and Google Photos even supports Live Photos these days, using those extra few frames of animation to create a GIF for you. The only negative is that the albums you've created in iOS don't get copied over (everything appears as one long list of pictures), so you need to create them again. Google Photos can transfer images and videos. (Image: Google) All that is easy enough but if you've got photos in iCloud you've moved off your iPhone then you might have a problem or two on your hands. As we explained in our full guide to the topic of switching between Apple Photos and Google Photos, just about the only option open to you is downloading them all from iCloud to a macOS or Windows machine then uploading them again using a Google Photos client. It's a little convoluted but it's manageable, and it's a lot easier than using the export options in iCloud on the web, which are practically non-existent. If you don't have a computer to act as the middleman between iCloud Photo Library and Google Photos then you're stuck — you'll have to borrow a laptop from someone. Music and movies As we now have Apple Music on Android, getting your iTunes music on your Android device is no longer the exercise in frustration it once was. As far as tunes you've actually purchased directly from iTunes, it's probably the best option out there, though you do need to have signed up for an Apple Music subscription to be able to use the app and get at your purchases. Otherwise, it depends on where your music is and how it's stored. Any plain old MP3s you were syncing to your iPhone from iTunes can be uploaded to Google Play Music instead (50,000 of them can be stored for free), or you can use something like DoubleTwist, which is just about the leading choice if you want to keep on using iTunes alongside Android for your music. If you're signed up for Spotify you just need the Android app. Apple Music, now on Android. Image: Screenshot Likewise, if you've been accessing all your movies and TV shows through Netflix, Plex or Google Play Movies & TV then you just need to find and install the relevant app for Android and you're ready to go. All these services let you stream to multiple devices from a single account, so you can carry on using your iOS device if you need to. However, any videos you've purchased from iTunes won't run on Android at all — there's just no app to do it unless Apple ever gets around to making one. Several tools out there will do the job of removing iTunes DRM for you, but since we're getting into murky legal territory with that, we'll leave you to discover them for yourself. If you've invested hundreds of dollars in an iTunes digital library then you can still watch it on macOS, Windows, and the Apple TV, but not Android. Apps and games Generally speaking, all the apps you use on your iPhone are going to be available on Android as well, though there are a few exceptions — like Overcast and Day One. In terms of paid-for apps, you're going to have to pay for them all again, unfortunately, though something like a Spotify subscription buys you access on both Android and iOS. Whether all your data (from documents to saved games) moves over with you is another matter and worth checking up on before you make the switch. If you're in any doubt, get in touch with the developer directly to see what the situation is (you might be out of luck with anything that relies heavily on the iCloud storage system). Some paid-for iOS games, like Alto's Adventure, are free to play on Android. (Image: Noodlecake Studios Inc) We can't give you a guide to everything out there, but think about your productivity, fitness, and banking apps. Assess how much data is stored locally and what's going to happen to it. If you can, keep your old iPhone and new Android phone running alongside each other for a while until you're certain everything's been moved over successfully without too many bumps in the road. You might not believe it if you've read everything that's above, but moving from iOS to Android is actually much easier than it used to be, thanks mainly to an increased focus on cloud services (even, belatedly, from Apple itself). As long as you take your time, and don't live your life inside iMessage, you don't have to feel daunted by the task. WATCH MORE: Tech News & Life Hacks Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

Ongoing secrecy around the NBN, a project that’s likely to cost more than A$50 billion, makes it impossible for the public in most cases to know when and what quality service they will receive. Further, new research shows the NBN rollout was politically motivated and socioeconomically biased from the beginning. It is perhaps time to remind ourselves of the ups and downs of the project that was once announced as a dream national infrastructure project for the 21st century. This requires a ten-year journey back in time, before we can figure out what needs to be done next.

Image: Anindito Mukherjee/ Reuters Reliance Infrastructure Mumbai Metro on Friday announced a tie-up with Google to provide details and information about the service, an official spokesperson said here. The Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL) has collaborated with Google Maps to give the people its authentic timetable and associated geographic details on all the Metro stations on the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar route. Through the Google Maps app, the trip timings are provided on each service operated at a frequency of four minutes during peak and eight minutes in non-peak hours. The trip timings, which correspond to services provided on weekdays and on Sundays, can help commuters plan their journeys to reach their destinations faster. “We diligently explore all the possible ways of making the journey of the commuters seamless and convenient, and the tie-up with Google Maps adds another step to digitise Mumbai Metro One,” the spokesperson explained. On Google Maps app, the user can tap the Metro Services Option which opens a departure board displaying the schedules of the next few Metro services from that station in both directions. The app will also showcase facilities like stairs, escalators, elevators, ticket counters, in all the three levels of the station including road, concourse and platforms to help all commuters, regulars and new on the entire network. Maharashtra’s first Metro, the MMOPL is 11.4 km long providing a crucial east-west suburban connectivity, with 12 stations, reducing the commute between Versova-Ghatkopar from 90 minutes to barely 21 minutes now.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Google’s Instant Tethering is coming to Chromebooks 06/02/2017 at 3:30 PM by Brad Linder 1 Comment Google rolled out Instant Tethering for Android devices earlier this year, making it easy to share your phone’s internet connection with other devices without needing to enter a password. Just enable the feature on any devices that are tied to your Google account and which support Instant Tethering, and if your tablet has no internet connection it can automatically connect to your phone… or vice versa. At launch, the feature only worked on Android devices. But it looks like it’s coming to Chromebooks. Chrome Story found an experimental option in the latest Chrome OS Canary build to enable Instant Tethering on a Chromebook. You have to go enter chrome://flags/ in the location bar, then search for the Instant Tethering flag. Turn it on, reboot the laptop, and when your Android phone is nearby it can automatically share an internet connection with your Chromebook without prompting you to connect to the network or enter a password. This option is only available in the Canary channel now, and Chrome Story notes that it doesn’t actually seem to work yet. So the feature may need further testing before it rolls out more widely. It’s also worth noting that Google’s support page says the only devices that officially support Instant Tethering so far are recent Nexus and Pixel devices. But that could change in the future, and I have to imagine the plan was always to offer support for Chromebooks at some point, since Instant Tethering that shares a connection between a smartphone and a laptop makes a lot more sense than the Android-to-Android tethering we’ve had up until now.

Really wish Google would offer both options on the Google WiFi. So you can continue to do things the old fashion way with machines and IP addresses. But add able to do things based on Google accounts. So instead of grounding a kid from Internet use by his machine instead by his account. So if he just grabs his brothers CB it will NOT work. Same with this phone, etc. All my kids have Google accounts so should be able to do this. Google wrote the Beyond Corp paper years ago and now, come on, just implement!!

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Why Bing Video Search is better than YouTube Search By Martin Brinkmann on June 3, 2017 in Internet - Last Update:June 3, 2017 27 You have a lot of options when it comes to watching videos on your devices. Most users seem to use YouTube more or less exclusively for all their family friendly video needs, but sites like Vimeo or Dailymotion are popular as well. Search on YouTube, with YouTube being a Google property, should be one of the strong features of the video streaming site, but it is not really. While it works, and even lets you filter by upload date and some additional features, it is nowhere near where it could be. It has no preview feature for instance, and while you can add it using extensions, something like it should be built-in in my opinion. I run all my video searches on Bing Video Search instead, and have two core reasons for that which I would like to explain in detail in the coming paragraphs. Note: I understand that the comparison between a single-site search engine (YouTube), and a multi-site search engine is not entirely fair. Google's own Video Search seems to focus heavily on YouTube as well however. Bing Video Search Bing Video Search is a feature of Microsoft's search engine Bing. While I don't use Bing at all for Web searches, as I find the search engine lacking in that regard -- especially for non-English queries -- I find some of Bing's other features quite useful and often superior to Google's offerings. You can use the following URL as your entry point to run video searches on Bing: https://www.bing.com/videos/ Simply enter the term you are interested in, and wait for Bing to return results to you. Results are listed with thumbnails, the source site they are hosted on, and information on views, play time, uploader, upload date and title. While most videos may be hosted on YouTube, you may get results from other sites such as Vimeo, Youku, VM, and lots of other video hosting sites as well. This depends largely on your query. This is the first advantage that Bing Video Search offers over YouTube's or Google Video's own search function. Sites like Vimeo host exclusive content for instance sometimes. A search on YouTube won't find those videos, while a search on Bing will. The second feature that makes Bing Video Search superior in my opinion is its preview feature. You can hover over any video on Bing Video Search to get a preview of the video. This preview includes sound, and is a great way to quickly determine a video's quality, and whether it matches what you are looking for. These two features are not the only ones that Bing offers. Here is a short list of other features that you may find interesting: Better filters: You can sort by date, length or resolution, or filter by a specific source. If you turn off SafeSearch, you will get NSFW results. Save videos to your Microsoft Account, and get personalized feeds based on your savings and activity. Closing Words Bing Video Search is a handy multi-site search engine for videos that returns both family friendly and NSFW results based on SafeSearch settings. Its preview feature is the feature that I like the most, as it does away with the "opening video > realizing it is not what I was looking for > going back"  workflow on YouTube. Now You: Which video search engine do you use, and why?

Reply chesscanoe June 3, 2017 at 1:37 pm # I don't do much searching for videos, but on Windows 10 CU using latest Chrome beta on your URL causes no slowdown for me, and the preview function is really useful - a big thanks to Martin. Reply Rick A. June 3, 2017 at 4:01 pm # Yeah, the slowdown is because of my browser or maybe an extension. With the URL if you use the one in the article https://www.bing.com/videos/ it immediately changes to https://www.bing.com/videos/explore?FORM=RECMVI but if you use https://www.bing.com/videos/explore it stays that way and is what i call a clean URL. That's what i would bookmark. i never bookmark sites with "ref" and similar, i always clean the URL's first. Yeah that preview feature is nice. i know that there's an extension for Scroogle Chrome https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-preview/hmggjocpafbpjdhoknaneokaklekakeh that shows images when you hover over the thumbnails on YouTube but i found a better one for Firefox that actually plays the video and sound when you hover over the thumbnail, and it's a web extension - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yt-video-thumbs/ - Now i use another web extension Magic Actions For YouTube - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/magic-actions-for-youtube/ - and in that extension if i have the day/night feature enabled and the light switch flipped which makes YouTube dark, the thumbnail preview only plays sound and no video. Hopefully a future update for one of the extensions fixes this. Also i checked in about:performance and both extensions don't cause any performance issue at all. i recommend them. Richard Allen June 3, 2017 at 2:56 pm # Just tried the same video search on Chrome x64, Pale Moon x86, FF ESR x64, Nightly x64 and the latest Vivaldi x64 snapshot and they all worked fine, for me. I've been using Nightly this morning and was very surprised when it put a major beat down on Chrome when scrolling the page. Scrolling the video search results was very smooth in Nightly but choppy in Chrome and I will be the first to admit that Chrome is generally a performance beast. I've noticed in the past that Chrome doesn't load the GPU as hard as FF and Nightly on my system, that could explain some of the difference in scrolling performance. Also, with Pale Moon, FF and Nightly I have changed two about:config entries: mousewheel.acceleration.start=3 mousewheel.min_line_scroll_amount=3 Makes a Big difference on my computers. Vivaldi had the 2nd best scrolling performance, for me, it's not bashful about loading up the GPU on graphics heavy pages. I'm using Win7 Pro. Reply Jacks June 3, 2017 at 8:08 pm # What are you using a Intel Celeron processor from 2001 and 64MB GPU? That page is smooth on all my devices. Reply Fena June 3, 2017 at 8:14 am # Never used before so gave it a try. First search over 150 showed up and only one was NOT youtube ? Reply Martin Brinkmann June 3, 2017 at 8:17 am # Results depend largely on the search term. YouTube results are dominant in most areas because YouTube is home to the majority of videos on this planet. Reply Jeff June 3, 2017 at 9:50 am # With all due respect, I disagree. YouTube's filters are its killer feature. Duration/length filter, upload date and sorting make finding the right video very easy. Reply jupe June 3, 2017 at 10:35 am # you can filter the Bing results too, in the top right there is a filter link. Reply Jeff June 3, 2017 at 12:24 pm # Screenshot? I don't think it's there for videos, only for web results. zero June 3, 2017 at 1:13 pm # You can see the filter button on the screenshot in the article. Reply Jeff June 3, 2017 at 6:53 pm # Ah I was using Opera where Bing DOES NOT show any filters! Got them in Chrome. Dorn June 4, 2017 at 2:15 pm # A preview-with-sound on hover feature is hugely lacking though. However, I'm not giving out my search trends to Microsoft. They already have one of my big emails from the era before ProtonMail, I don't want them to cross data. YouTube has way too much data as well but there's not much of a choice here, so... Though to be honest, videos on Youtube can be found on Dailymotion too, it's just that people insist on picking and spreading the Youtube link all the time. Makes it hard to switch to Dailymotion. Reply Tom Hawack June 4, 2017 at 3:01 pm # I agree concerning users fascination for YouTube when other video sites are available, DailyMotion of course, Vimeo as well though perhaps the latter more sophisticated (in the good sens of the word). Concerning DailyMotion, it's nice but you definitely won't find as much as you do on YouTube. The site also seems obsessed with ads to the point that pre-video advertisement is inevitable unless blocked in either of the following ways, and that is a policy I don't understand when that of a site which is loosing users day by day because mainly of YouTube : being extra-zealous with ads when theses are easily avoidable on YouTube is rather stupid IMO, not to mention that DailyMotion could work on a more attractive interface. Two ways I know to skip the in-video DailyMotion ads : 1- If using 'uBlock Origin' add to the 'My filters' section a dedicated uBO filter : @@dailymotion.com##script:inject(1136.js) 2- Use a script called 'Dailymotion Raw Html5 Player' available at GreasyFork I use the script because it ads many features to the simple fact of avoiding in-video ads, but I remember that before that uBlockO' filter made it nicely. I hope it still works because DailyMotion has spent a lot of time trying to defeat those in-video ad-blockers and may have changed their code, again, since. You don't bother people with unavoidable in-video users when your site is falling : a truly immature attitude. They already have the site ads, why ad ads to ads? Gosh! I do visit DailyMotion, and Vimeo, especially when no particular search in mind. Should DailyMotion reconsider its in-video advertisement that they could possibly increase their audience. Pity, it's otherwise a nice place, even if they could redesign it. ram sam June 3, 2017 at 11:19 am # Normally I dont prefer bing, but this seems interesting. I will give it a try and share my opinions later Reply Tom Hawack June 3, 2017 at 11:53 am # "Microsoft to pay users if they search with Bing" (In Britain) http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/microsoft-to-pay-users-if-they-search-with-bing/articleshow/58941261.cms Well, if Bing Video is that good I wouldn't charge a penny should I connect from U.K. :) Reply RichH June 3, 2017 at 6:13 pm # Bing has been allowing US users to earn Amazon cash rewards for ages. Besides the fact that I don't like Google's search appearance for most things, I have been getting $5 every six weeks from Bing toward Amazon for years. More importantly, the article is correct for any kind of video searching as well as most picture searching. Bing is far superior to anything Google has to offer in these areas. Reply Yuliya June 3, 2017 at 12:01 pm # Minus the audio preview, which it lacks, I think Yandex is better. UI is a lot better and lighter, also the video on the right keeps playing just fine while you can perform different searches. [https://i.imgur.com/dyNkU0K.jpg] It is amasing how YouTube does not have any form of preview in this day and age though. Reply Richard Allen June 3, 2017 at 1:43 pm # Thanks Martin! I had no idea that MS had really stepped up their game with Bing. Has some nice search filters and... video preview also? I hope Google is paying attention. It's refreshing to see MS putting out a product/service that I want to use! Now if I could only get them to quit trying to stab me in the back with Win7 updates 'my' world would be easier. :) Screenshot of Bing video search filter.

Reply RG June 3, 2017 at 8:06 pm # Everybody who leaves a positive comment about Bing gets one too. Tom Hawack June 3, 2017 at 8:49 pm # "Imagination is funny, makes a cloudy day sunny, makes a bee think of honey just as I think of you..." would sing Dean Martin. Imagination. If you take a large group which you know dislikes for the most part a person, a company, an institution and you'd like them to start bashing because from your point of view they've sort of forgot doing so, the best way is to evoke that person, company, institution in flattering terms : you can be quite sure that will trigger your audience's minds, wake them up and have them put that extra layer of bashing which was missing, without yourself being considered as the "pusher". Therefor, this article, with imagination, could as well have been sponsored by, say, Google, just to remind users how much they dislike a company and for those who like it how many others just don't, to put il extra-mildly! Finally, the simple hypothesis of an article written freely, based on an experience which would appear as a good opportunity to remind us all that nothing, no one is totally bad (nor good) remains plausible :) Reply flyli5411 June 3, 2017 at 9:47 pm # IDIOT COMMENT TO MAKE It smells like it is a sponsored article from MS. TROLL Reply jasray June 3, 2017 at 5:38 pm # Of course--click, search, "Oh, I might like that." Click-- "Harry Styles - Sign of the Times" "This video contains content from VEVO. It is restricted from playback on certain sites or applications. Watch on YouTube" Why would I want to use Bing's Video Search? When I search for something and it is listed, I make the assumption that the search is valid and the link to the content is valid. I don't expect a link from the search to offer me a UK link that Bing already knows won't play in the US. A real drip of golden honey. Reply Tim June 3, 2017 at 7:15 pm # "...If you turn off SafeSearch, you will get NSFW results." That's one area where Bing really excels. :) Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Google Photos will now suggest photos to archive Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 3:44pm PDTJun 2, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 50 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares134 Applications News Google Photos has become a very convenient way to back up all your photos... all of them. Even all the receipts, addresses, and other junk. Google recently added archiving to get that stuff out of the main timeline, but now it's going a step further by suggesting photos to archive. It sounds like the feature we spotted in a recent APK Teardown. The suggestions will appear as a card in the Assistant tab inside Photos. Google will use its machine learning magic to figure out what's in the photo, marking potentially unimportant ones for archiving. You then have the chance to evaluate the selections before proceeding, so you won't accidentally sweep up any important pics. New! See suggestions for photos to archive, so you can move photos you don’t want to see in your main library. See ya later, receipts 👋 pic.twitter.com/RpjBquGN5G — Google Photos (@googlephotos) June 2, 2017 Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. All the images you archive will remain in albums and search results. They're just more out of the way. This feature is still rolling out, so give it time. Manual archiving is already available, though. Tags apps Google google+ photos photos subscribe ...

Mine is automatically turned on when I just checked it right now. needa Nothing for me. DP2 XL needa I have thousands duplicate type photos. I seriously hope it advises me to archive all of them. I have been waiting for Google to do something like this for a while now. Maybe if I can get rid of all the clutter, I can stick stuff in albums and clean it all up. Mustafa Selçuk Öztürk I got the update and it shows under Assistant Cards, but no suggestion yet. Waiting patiently... myssi it must be processing your photos brkshr This archiving feature is a godsend!!! My wedding and my honeymoon tour of 7 national parks takes up at least a third of the photo's I have saved from the past 15 years or so. I already archived about half of my wedding photo's. Now I just need to get through the metric ton of honeymoon photo's I have of nature and driving and it will be much easier to find the important photo's. Dennis Ulijn It's also important to solve this problem from the other end: start realizing which photos matter to you. Nature pictures? Architectural pictures? Portraits, group pictures? Nature and architecture are abundant, I just try to shoot the people I'm with, mostly spontaneously or without the knowing because I want to capture the moment. I don't have to archive many photos, and I do take a lot of pictures of my kids. abc Some people like nature more than people. :) Besides, the easiest solution is not take any pics at all because someone else in the group will do it and share them with you. Dennis Ulijn I doubt my toddlers will take a good picture ;-) well, to each their own. Sometimes avoiding the problem is simpler than solving it. Lourdesdcruz Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Facts Cool feature Erstam I wish they would adopt a folder and sub folder like structure. I would still much rather organize my photos that way. It suggested i archive all my screen shots. Meh. Rudder2 JunkMail I agree with you. I hate Google Photos' organization and use Google Drive instead because I like organizing my photos with folders and subfolders. Another beef with Google Photos is it doesn't recognize my Google Drive Photo folders as albums. Google has a lot to learn how people like to organize photos. The Google Drive help line tried to get me to switch to Google Photos and I gave him an ear load. I spend hours organizing my photos on my computer and Google just doesn't care and wants us to do it again in their app. Anon They need to let us archive entire folders automatically, like the whatsapp image folder Vlad > Archiving in Google Photos is a bit different than archiving in other Google products. No it's not. This is EXACTLY how it works in Gmail and how I count on it to work. Everything is still categorised, it's just not there when opening gmail.com Cakefish This is completely unrelated to the article but I'm getting very impatient waiting for Motorola and Nokia to reveal their 2017 phones. Do you have any news on release dates for us AP? DynamikD I'm glad about this feature. Great way to hide photos that you may not want to people to view. I don't quite understand why people still complain about not being able to create folders though. It's an archaic way of doing things. That's why you can create albums within photos. Serves the same function but it leverages meta data which is more efficient and makes searching for photos and videos easier within the app. Yuri Vidal if google photos would only give me the option to NOT BACKUP my screenshots... i hate it! (Samsung stores screenshots under /DCIM/Screenshots so, google photos thinks they are pictures and uploads them. There is no way to unselect this folder, since it is a subfolder of the pitures folder... PLEASE FIX THIS! Ozl This is just great! i have a lot of files being uploaded on wifi from whatsapp and some i forget to delete, and others are just there just in case, so yes, Thanks Google! Fruity101079 I thought this archive function was useless, and it is for me, but when i see your comments, i guess i was wrong. It seems to be useful to a lot of you who didn't take time to organize and arrange your photos.

PHOTO: AFP EU antitrust regulators aim to slap a hefty fine on Alphabet unit Google over its shopping service before the summer break in August, two people familiar with the matter said, setting the stage for two other cases involving the US company. The European Commission’s decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world’s most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both US and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The US company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon and eBay Inc. EU fines Facebook 110 million euros over misleading WhatsApp data Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google’s case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission’s tough line is in sharp contrast with the US Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop “scraping” reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. EU threatens Microsoft with antitrust fine over web browser Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia’s successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its “AdSense for Search” platform. The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases.

But smartwatches are part of a crowded and competitive market, and some brands have fallen away, such as the Microsoft Band or the discontinued Moto 360. Many high-end smartwatches have sought to emulate the success of fitness trackers, offering abilities such as heart rate monitoring, GPS and water resistance. Others have gone down a luxury route, trying to match the style of traditional timepieces. The Telegraph has broken down some of the best smartwatches for different uses to help pick a timepiece that is right for you. Should I buy a smartwatch? There has never been a better time to buy a smartwatch. Many of the teething problems in the technology have been dealt with and smartwatches have now moved beyond early adopters to become a genuine tech and style statement. The best smartwatches rival cheaper sports watches for fitness tracking performance, although you can still find good deals on the popular Fitbit and Garmin devices.  And smartwatches offer significantly to levels of connectivity with your smartphone, from answering calls to voice control, while more advanced models can offer 4G connection and contactless payments. Which smartwatch operating system is best? There are three main smartwatch operating systems, most of which offer similar capabilities but with some distinctions. Given that your smartwatch will spend lots of its time connected via Bluetooth to your smartphone, you will want to make sure you have a degree of cross compatibility, although most operating systems now work with all smartphones, whether they run on Android or iOS. WatchOS: The latest WatchOS 3 for Apple smartwatches is lightning fast with upgraded fitness apps and useful features such as theatre mode (which stops your watch waking up accidentally). It is a great system, but is best used alongside and iPhone. Android Wear: The 2.0 edition of Android Wear was a step up  with new functions including Google voice control, Android Pay and the ability to make 4G calls. It is used on most new smartwatches. TizenOS: Used for Samsung smartwatches, it has an intuitive interface and design, but is best suited to Samsung devices. It does have 4G, but currently only in the US. Do I want to use my smartwatch for sport? When buying a smartwatch you will want to consider whether you want it as a fitness aid or a fashion statement. There are some differences between smartwatches and fitness trackers. Fitness trackers often have less functionality when it comes to reading and responding to texts or emails. But plenty of smartwatches are tailored for outdoorsy types and fitness fanatics, with step and calorie counters linked to your smartphone. If you want a smartwatch for sport you should also consider one with a more durable watch face, silicon straps and waterproofing. If you prefer a smartwatch as a style accessory plenty come with leather and other materials as straps, and there are a number of watch brands that now make smartwatches, although you will pay premium for the best materials. How much should I pay for a smartwatch? Realistically, a good budget smartwatch should cost around £100 to £150. Fitbit's Blaze is probably the best cheap smartwatch, although it is simple in design and doesn't have all the features of the Android Wear operating system. Mid-range smartwatches will run between £200 and £300. At this level you should be getting Android Wear 2 software or an Apple Watch. More expensive smartwatches of £300 and up will have voice control and luxury features such as deep waterproofing. Many will also be a fashion statement to compete with the best traditional brands. Bear in mind that this technology is still developing and, like your smartphone, you may end up having to replace your smartwatch every few years, unlike the lifetime of service you could get out of a traditional watch. Other things to look out for in a smartwatch: Screen size: A screen that is too small may be fiddly to use, a screen that is too large may be heavy and chunky. Some smartwatches come in more than one size to fit different wrists. Battery life:  This is the main sticking point for many smartwatch users. Battery life can vary hugely and is unimpressive compared to any normal watch. Ideally you want at least two days of charge with limited use, with regular use you may see a lot less. Processor and storage: Most smartwatches will have similar processors that do not make huge levels to difference to performance and many come with 4GB of storage as standard. Below are some of the best smartwatches you can buy now. The latest LG Watch Style has been left out as it has not yet been released in the UK, while the Moto 360 and Microsoft Band are also out as the manufacturers have put a hold on their smartwatch ranges. The history of wearable technology 01:26 Under £250 Sony Smartwatch 3 Credit: Sony Display: 1.6 inch Operating system: Android Wear Battery life: up to two days This impressive budget smartwatch filled in a lot of the gaps left by earlier cheap devices, fitting the bill on key smartwatch capabilities without compromising on price. This Sony watch has GPS, a compass, waterproofing, calls and 4GB of internal memory for storing music on the go and works with Android Wear for all the apps you need from Facebook notifications to emails. It has Google's voice control, although not the Google Assistant of more expensive brands and later updates to Android's operating system mean this watch could become less useful. It's also not the most stylish device compared to other brands. Pros: Cheap, GPS, compass, big screen Cons: Chunky design Price: £89.99 in green, £139.89 in black Buy now Fitbit Blaze Credit: Bloomberg Display: 1.25-inch Operating system: Fitbit software Battery life: up to 5 days Fitbit's Blaze is a useful little smartwatch idea at a great price. However, unlike other models it does lack the functionality of the Apple Watch or Samsung Gear, with few native apps, and with the Apple Watch proving such a good fitness tracking device the Fitbit has a lot of competition. But for almost £200 less than Apple's premium model, the Fitbit does punch above its weight. If all you need is simple tasks, such as answering or dismissing calls, all packed with Fitbit's activity tracking expertise this smartwatch is a good bet. Pros: Made for sport and running, sleep tracking, Fitbit app, battery life Cons: No voice control, limited smartwatch functionality Price: £139.95 with John Lewis, £159.99 with Fitbit Buy now Fossil Q Credit: Fossil Display: 1.4-inch Operating system: Android Wear 2.0 Battery life: 24 hours Updated with Android Wear 2.0, the new Fossil Q smartwatch can cover the ground you need with texts, alarm, calendar alerts and a fitness tracker, as well as an LED flashlight and Google voice control to perform some simple tasks. While it does have a nice traditional look, it is actually a very bulky watch on the wrist at around 14mm, while the average 24 hour battery life is not brilliant. The leather strap does make this watch quite attractive, but means it needs some protection from water and the elements. Pros: Traditional design, plenty of custom builds,  Google Assistant voice control Cons: Fairly limited battery life, chunky Price: £188. 72 with Amazon, £229 with House of Fraser Buy now Huawei Watch Credit: Huawei Display: 1.4 Operating system: Android Wear Battery life: one and a half days If you want a smartwatch that looks more like a traditional timepiece then the original Huawei Watch is still a great bet, and now comes in as a relatively budget option in the world of smartwatches. Compared to recent new releases such as the Samsung Gear S3 it is good value and was the best Android watch around on its initial release. You can choose between leather straps or stainless steel, however the leather option will be more vulnerable to water damage. It has a sharp, circular screen with high 400 x 400 resolution. It can also be upgraded to Android Wear 2.0, which will offer more Google voice control. Pros: Premium look and good screen quality Cons: Now two years old, not waterproofed Price: £219.99 Buy now Asus Zenwatch 3 Credit: Asus Display: 1.39-inch Operating system: Android Wear 1.5 Battery life: up to two days The Asus Zenwatch is a good looking device. With the option of leather straps and a bold, bright 1.39 inch face with 400 x 400 resolution it is easy to look at. It has reasonable fitness monitoring ability and can act as a mouthpiece for taking calls on your phone. However, the current lack of an Android Wear 2 update means there are many limits such as no Google Assistant voice commands (although it does support the simpler Google Now) and limited waterproofing.   Pros: Good looks and bright screen Cons: Lacking in latest operating system Price: £229 Buy now Under £300 Apple Watch Series 1 Credit: Bloomberg Display: 1.65-inch Operating system: watchOS Battery life: 18 hours regular use, up to two days While it does lack some of the more advanced features of the Series 2 such as extra waterproofing and GPS, the Apple Watch Series 1 is still a premium smartwatch. It has the easily navigable watchOS and the functionality of Siri, as well as Apple Pay. The Apple Watch is now also considered one of the top fitness watches you can buy, with intuitive fitness tracking apps and a heart rate monitor.  While Apple says its battery life should be 18 hours with regular use, most people will easily get two days out of the watch if you limit use to time checking and the odd workout. Pros: Almost as good as the Series 2, significantly cheaper Cons: Not as waterproofed and no GPS Price: £269 Buy now Samsung Gear S3 Credit: Samsung Display: 1.3-inch Operating system: Tizen Battery life: up to 4 days Samsung's latest Gear S3 watch has a classic look and plenty of features to make this a brilliant smartwatch. On this smartwatch you can rotate the bezel to perform tasks such as responding to calls or reading messages, although its touchscreen is slightly on the smaller side for a fairly large watch. It can also use S Voice for voice control to make a call or send a text, and it features Samsung Pay. It has GPS and a solid battery life, meaning you will only have to take it off for charging every few days. It comes in two designs with a rugged "frontier" version and a smart "classic" look. However, the Gear S3 does only have water resistance to a distance of 1.5 metres, limited compared to the Apple Watch Series 2. Pros: Great battery life, innovative bezel for quick functions, S Voice control Cons: Smaller screen and limited water resistance Price: £295.00 Buy now Huawei Smartwatch 2 Credit: Huawei Display: 1.2 inch Operating system: Android Wear 2.0 Battery life: up to two days Huawei's 2017 watch outing mirrors some of the design elements of the original Huawei Watch, although the availability of its "classic" design is currently limited in the UK. As well as standard apps, Google Assistant voice control and the ability to make Android Pay contactless payments, the Huawei Watch 2 is one step ahead with integrated 4G connectivity, allowing you to make calls directly from your watch away from your phone. Downsides include battery life which, for a watch that costs this much, is a little low. It is only splash resistant and lacks GPS functions that are part of its main rival in the Apple Watch Series 2. Pros: 4G option, classic look, voice control Cons: Limited water resistance, no GPS, expensive for 4G Price: £269 from Amazon (no 4G) £299 from Amazon (with 4G), £379 from Currys (with 4G) Buy now Luxury smartwatches Apple Watch Series 2 Credit: Bloomberg Display: 1.65-inch Operating system: watchOS Battery life: 18 hours regular use, up to two days The Apple Watch Series 2 is still one of the best smartwatches you can buy with tonnes of great features and running on the smooth watchOS. It has a brighter OLED (organic LED) display than its predecessor and is water resistant up to 50 metres. Other great features include a heart rate sensor, accelerometer and built-in GPS. It is, however, hit by a hefty price tag, and although the design appeals to some it is not the most stylish timepiece around. For something a little different you can pay more for a stainless steel case and metallic strap, but this pushes the price up to nearly £700. Pros: Water resistant, sharp screen, watchOS, GPS Cons: Expensive, battery life, no sleep tracking Price: £396 for aluminium case, £699 with stainless steel case and Milanese loop Buy now Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 Credit: TAG Heuer Display: 1.39 inch Operating system: Android Wear 2.0 Battery life: 25 hours with regular use Luxury Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer was never going to be the cheapest option. If you are willing to shell out more than £1,000 on a smartwatch then you can with the Connected Modular 45. It has a striking look, while its modular flexibility makes for great customisation, although this in a sense loses the more iconic look of some Swiss watches. It has GPS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, although no 4G (which is likely to become standard on the more expensive smartwatches). It also has no heart rate monitor, making it a little less useful for fitness fans. If style is your main concern, the Tag Heuer ticks the boxes, but with smartwatches likely to keep evolving it may be too much of an investment just yet. Pros: Premium build and design Cons:  Price: £1,200 from Tag Heuer, £5,700 (with diamond studded bezel) Buy now Best technology you can buy grid   Share this article Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest Related Topics TAG Heuer Android Apple Watch Smartwatches Apple Show more Technology latest 05 Jun 2017, 12:01am Comment: As AI moves on, it's time for Apple's Siri to grow up James Titcomb Premium 04 Jun 2017, 11:13am When is WWDC 2017 and what will Tim Cook and Apple announce? 04 Jun 2017, 11:12am WWDC 2017: iOS 11 best features and release date, plus everything we know about Apple's new software 03 Jun 2017, 7:30pm Price comparison site Kelkoo takes Google to High Court over abuse of search dominance 03 Jun 2017, 6:00am The British scientists on the brink of changing the human race forever Premium 03 Jun 2017, 3:09am A wizard idea?

He provides unique big picture analysis of the complex world of Microsoft. Jason takes the small clues and gives you an insightful big picture perspective through storytelling that you won't find anywhere else. Seriously, this dude thinks outside the box. Follow him on Twitter at @JLTechWord. He's doing the "write" thing! Microsoft is one of the world's most recognized brands. Sadly that recognition has not translated into widespread consumer success. The company is part of the "background" of many of our lives. That's both a blessing and curse. The blessing is Microsoft's products and services help many of us get things done. The curse is that Microsoft's presence is often like the white noise used to lull people to sleep. Conversely, Apple and Google are like hit songs that are intentionally turned on, cranked up, and for which the lyrics are memorized and sung in sync with the artist. These companies are synced with consumers in a way Microsoft is not but needs to be. For instance, Microsoft's premiere product, Office, is the industry's status quo for productivity. It's how we get work done. But for many, it's an uninspiring and boring necessity. Apple's premiere product, the iPhone, and various phones running Google's Android, however, are fun. They make users feel good and are part of their personal expression. Apple and Google have what many call "cool factor." Microsoft? Well, it's getting there. Microsoft has money to burn, resources galore and is a globally recognized brand. Microsoft also ranked ninth in the 2016 Top 100 Millennial Brands: Moose Tracker Report. This was above number eleven ranked Google but below number one ranked Apple which is also the most valuable company. So why can't Microsoft seem to emerge from a position of background noise and leap to the forefront of what consumers want? The personal computing disconnect Personal computing is Microsoft's forte, and 88.75 percent of homes and businesses that use PCs use Windows PCs. That fact is a legacy of Microsoft's heyday when the company's PC dominance in the enterprise trickled into the consumer space. Smartphones are now the go-to "computer" for many personal computing tasks. Smartphones function as an access point to a horde of personal information making them the most personal object most of us carry. They're also the portal to the broader ecosystems of the providers of mobile platforms. This portal has helped Apple and Google, the two companies that dominate the mobile space, cement themselves in the collective minds of the masses. Daily, billions of users interact with Google's and Apple's ecosystems in ways that feel good and personal, not required and functional, which is often Microsoft's plight. Microsoft isn't oblivious to its poor consumer rapport. It's made multiple, but failed, attempts to bring its enterprise success to the consumer space. Microsoft flops: Kin, Kinect, Windows Phone and Zune Here are several areas where Microsoft failed in the consumer space. Microsoft Kin After two years of development and a strategic acquisition of Danger Incorporated, Microsoft in 2010 launched the social network-focused Kin smartphone. It was targeted at the trend-setting 18- to 30-year-old demographic. The phone was only on the market for 48 days when it was unceremoniously discontinued. It briefly returned as a cheaper but also unsuccessful feature phone. In-fighting within Microsoft resulted in the project falling under different leadership, a change in the original vision and a delay to market, and all of that is blamed for Kin's demise. Microsoft Zune Launched in 2006 Microsoft's Zune was the company's answer to Apple's iPod which launched five years earlier. Apple's significant lead continued with its 2007 launch of iPod Touch two years before the 2009 Zune HD. In addition to consumer mindshare, Apple garnered developer and other support which supplied Apple's ecosystem with millions of apps and accessories that supported the iPod's market position. Unable to compete, the Zune was discontinued in 2011, five years after its launch. Kinect Microsoft's Kinect, which used a natural user interface of motion-detecting and voice interaction was introduced in 2010 as part of Xbox 360. In 2011, the Kinect SDK was announced as well as the Kinect for Windows program. There was a lot of anticipation as hundreds of companies around the world had shown interest in building apps for Kinect. Though the Kinect 2.0 received deeper Universal Windows Platform (UWP) integration and Windows Hello capabilities late last year, the initial fervor for the myriad uses of the technology in various industries has significantly diminished. And the consumer-facing gaming aspects for Kinect have all but fizzled out. Windows Phone After an enduring presence in the enterprise-focused smartphone space since the early 2000s, Microsoft finally entered the consumer smartphone market three years after the iPhone and two years after Android in 2010. Windows Phones' fluid and unique OS never caught on with consumers. Limited marketing and distribution, "breaks" in the platform on its way to OneCore, poor developer support, a lack of inspiring flagships, and the buggy Windows 10 Mobile have been the platform's plight. A reputation for having no apps, the vocal discontent of disenchanted fans and consistently negative press have poisoned the waters for Windows phones among consumers. Windows phone isn't dead These flops and a history of early innovation with little to no consumer-facing follow through have hampered Microsoft's consumer success. Microsoft could have beat the iPad and Siri to market, for instance, based on early investments in tablets and AI. It's not all bad Microsoft introduced Xbox in 2001, and despite competition from Sony's PlayStation, unrelenting investments made it a consumer success. Similarly, unyielding commitment and drive turned the failing Surface into a category-defining (2-in-1 PCs) billion dollar business and one of the industry's most respected brands. TV marketing ads, network TV product placements (for example, Black-ish) and corporate partnerships such as the contract with the NFL position Surface beside Xbox in the consumer consciousness. Despite NFL commentators' references to Surface as an iPad, Microsoft is gaining "cool points." The Surface is still in a battle for "prime time," however. ABC News reporters "use" the Surface, kind of. Throughout the news segments, Surfaces remain untouched on the news desk, behind the iPads that the reporters actively use. Hopefully, Microsoft can get ABC to move from displaying Surfaces to using them on national television. Still, the brand has expanded to include the college student-focused Surface Laptop, and the Apple's creatives-stealing Surface Studio. The former has yet to be tested in the market, and the latter has piqued the interest of its intended target. Furthermore, Microsoft has added and will be bringing new features to Windows 10 such as Paint 3D, Mixed Reality, system-wide inking and more, which the company hopes will appeal to consumers. Microsoft's Mixed Reality wearable computer, HoloLens, is arguably the coolest product it has created. If it were ready for the consumer market, the company would doubtlessly be considered cool. Alas, the next iteration of HoloLens has been pushed out to 2019. Part of pop culture Despite Microsoft's Xbox and Surface success and potential with Mixed Reality, to the average consumer, the company doesn't occupy the same space as Apple or Google. As the leading search engine, "Google" has become a verb in our dialogue when it's time to, well, Google something. Apple's former CEO Steve Jobs through vision, standards for quality and marketing genius, imbued the company and its products with an intangible value that the media and consumers "feel" to this day. Additionally, movies about this iconic leader are an expression of the influence he and Apple had on the world. Microsoft needs to do more with its 'do-more' vision Microsoft doesn't have the pop culture appeal of Google and Apple. As a "do-more" company, it has focused on providing businesses and individuals with the tools to do more. Its enterprise-focused legacy has taught the company to exist "in the shadows" as the platform or infrastructure that helps others get things done. This mentality and associated marketing methods don't work in the sensory, in-your-face consumer space. Successful consumer-facing companies aggressively tell consumers why they need a product, how it'll improve their lives, and convince them it solves a problem they didn't know they had. Beyond Xbox and Surface, Microsoft lacks the aggression and stamina its rivals have in this regard. Microsoft leads in innovation but is slow to turn ideas into products, allowing competitors to beat it to market. The One Microsoft initiative was supposed to enable greater nimbleness by restructuring teams. That hasn't fully materialized. Microsoft's struggling to reach consumers at a point in history when personal computing has never been more consumer influenced. Will Microsoft have the aggression and stamina to market its student-focused Surface Laptop against the MacBook? What about Surface phone or a consumer-focused HoloLens? Sadly, until Microsoft is ready to "do more," it may always covet that elusive cool factor.

Students can bunde and over-priced Macbook into their student loans and over pay over time for their shiny fashion accessory. Xbox gets a pass because it isn't regarded as Windows to the console crowd, Windows means mom and dad doing their taxes or grandma on Facebook. Most of all Windows is associated with business and work, ugh, no one young and cool likes that. 0 2 hours ago Reply LaVike I'm not sure "cool factor" will do it.  Maybe "a clue" would!  MSFT doesn't get the consumer at all and does not cater to them.  Taking an Azure ad out in Business Weekly is what MSFT understands.  They don't understand how an "influencer" might be able to bring people into their fold much less have a strategic marketing campaign.  They have tried and some of their efforts have been very interesting but they don't stick with it.  Maybe a "set of cajones" might be needed more than "cool factor". 0 5 hours ago Reply cool8man The Microsoft Band 2.0 is a really cool little device. Apple Watch looks like a giant nerd watch by comparison, seriously I'm embarrassed whenever I see people wearing an Apple Watch. It just gives me flashbacks to calculator watches. The Microsoft Band is way better than a cheap looking Fitbit or Garmin fitness band too. Surface Studio is also cool, I just wish I could afford it. HoloLens isn't cool looking yet, but they are way ahead of the AR competition in design. If they switch HoloLens over to Snapdragon and can shrink it down to something more stylish they could have a major success on their hands. Much of the acceptance and cool factor of devices comes down to marketing. Surface Pro was sort of borderline in terms of design, but Microsoft's enormous $500M 5-year marketing budget and partnership with the NFL pushed Surface Pro into mainstream acceptance. If they get HoloLens into a more stylish design and convince the NFL to start using HoloLens on the sidelines you have a serious opportunity for Microsoft to mainstream another mobile computing product. 0 7 hours ago Reply bluekalo Nice article. Microsoft is not consumer centered 0 10 hours ago Reply TechFreak1 I would disagree about Windows phone not catching on with consumers, sure the gains in market share was slow but that's what happens when you cut off users and oems. Wp7->Wp8 kernel switch from CE. Wp8->WM10 loss of features that made Windows phone a joy to use. Plus US carriers didn't help the situation. Every where else Windows phone was gaining alot of momentum until Microsoft swung that massive axe to Nokia's D & S acquisition. Lastly, XES that was the gateway in making Microsoft "cool". But again lack of foresight and unwillingness to take risks by the management speaks volumes imo. Ballmer didn't bat and eye when he spent money maintaining consumers who had faulty xbox consoles (RRoD). Unrelenting investments is what made Bing, Xbox and Surface into what it is. They could have done the same with Windows Phones and XES.

I agree: if Microsoft took some cues from Apple and Google, they could have been more successful. The article overall? Mind...blown! 0 21 hours ago Reply mikedoeslife As has been noted here by a lot of people, the Microsoft and Windows brands are so heavily stigmatised by decades of allowing people to have the impression that the company's only goals were to turn us all into worker drones, and to make us use comparatively ugly interfaces with now iconic crash issues.  What Microsoft is doing these days is great stuff, but it needs to do some dramatic marketing and PR to really get people over the line. I'm really not sure MS can ever match Apple for cool factor, to be honest. After all, Jobs was considered a genius, and even though he was a **** person, he gave off this aura of utter coolness and driven focus. He had an exceptional aesthetic, and so much of Apple's history is steeped in the importance of consumer appeal. Microsoft has only started understanding that in the past 10 years at best.  Compare Jobs with the likes of Gates and Ballmer... yeah, Gates has proven to be one of the most incredibly respectable and thoroughly thoughtful people of his generation, but that doesn't change the fact that for decades he was seen as a bit of a knob.  Ballmer was a maniac, enough said there.  So, yeah. I don't know what Microsoft can do to win more fans, but... as much as "Apple is amazing omfg!" is ingrained in a generation of consumers, so is "eeeww Microsoft is for geeks". Not an easy thing to overcome.    0 1 day ago Reply Gregory Newman Folks Microaoft's bread and butter money comes from and still comes from it's  Buisiness/Enterprise services software. Ballmer failed to deliver mobile smartphones that sold well but Left Microsoft's Businees / Enterprise money making machine intact and it is growing in some area's such as it's cloud services. Microsoft itself seems to be going back to the Days of Windows phone 7 and 8 where it just made the softwre for Windows smart phones but it's OEM partners made the physical smartphones it appears for now Microsoft wil not make a classic shaped smart phone. it's OEM partner will do that. I think Microsoft's Mobile's Surface Mobile devices= The Surface laptop. Surface Book laptop/Tablet Hybrid and Surface Pro Tablet/Laptop Hybrids are where Microsoft will continuie to be successful. the Surface brand devices are a Billion dollar plus successful business for them. I think Microsoft will indeed produce a  2 screen Surface Mini Tablet / Smartphone hybrid. Indications are Microsoft has a special division of Windows 10 mobile to make it's interface design and Apps. I think this will be Microsoft's last new Hybrid device. I predict Microsoft will market them on a multi nation level like it did with the new Surface Laptop and new 2017 Surface Pro and sell enough of them on a World wide basis to make a profit. This device will not be for everyone but will sell well enough to survive because a lot of people world wide want a smart good Windows Tablet. I hope how they market this new 2 screen Mini tablet smart phone hybrid as a small fun filled consumer Music/Video media player, Mini Busisness production Tablet & Smartphone 3 in one device. It will be a Challenge for Microsoft to make Apps for this 2 screen Mini Tablet How ever it will Run full Windows 10 Desktop OS or Windows 10 on ARMS CPU  OS and ether way be able to run UWP Apps and  run Millions of titles of Full Win 32 X86 Desktop PC Programs. This Means if a person buys one they wont have a USELESS device.

For example with Windows Phone, instead of going for the premium phone market like the US, they instead made a bunch of cheap low end phones and tried to push those in developing nations while in the US, they stopped producing flagship phones for awhile which was perceived as a lack of commitment from Microsoft. And when they did finally produce a flagship phone like the Lumia 950, they carrier locked it to AT&T. The same problem also happened to Intel Atom smartphones. Instead of including a 4G modem and selling Intel powered phones in the US and other 1st world markets, they once again try to focus on developing markets. We all know what happened to Intel Atom smartphones after that. Never caught on and failed to the point where Intel completely dropped it's mobile efforts. Apple didn't succeed by first targeting iPhones towards developing markets. Android didn't succeed with cheap phone's either. It was the big flagships like Samsung's Galaxy line that put it on the radar. Microsoft, and Intel too, should've focused on the high-end premium flagship phone market in the US first. 0 1 day ago Reply @wp8fan Agree! Have said for years keep Joe B AWAY from the public.

Microsoft biggest problem even with the enterprise is communication.  You cannot get a team at Microsoft to come out with a clear explanation for anything. as a consumer when i buy a product i want to know what i can do with it right now, not what i could probably do with it. This is Microsoft fault this also seeps into their marketing. People, in general, are not educated on what Microsoft products can do, Microsoft then gives the communication portion to its fans and its partners.    Why did the xbox one not be a roaring success like the playstation, the exact same reason horrible communication and then horrible follow-ups to questions asked.    One additional thing that Microsoft needs to address is to show users why they want their product. needing a product and having to use a product are two very different things, one is out of love and the other is out of desperation. Microsoft is in the desperation camp. no one really needs a Microsoft product and Microsoft is doing its best to not want people to love them. even after the so called phone reboot, they will have lost the war and the followers and there will be no reason to want their product.  0 2 days ago Reply sdreamer Um.. put someone hip to present these things...

The Band.  SERIOUSLY ... nothing on the market even today could match what it had to offer.  Where is it ?  Simply dumped.  Why ?  Yeah, they had some manufacturing quality control issues, but those could have been resolved.  A few refinements would have helped, but they were also doable.  The problem ?  Microsoft had them in the stores and a few other places, but basically, unless you went searching for them, they were a secret.  I've had most of the alternatives, and NOTHING comes close to what the Band could do.   Perhaps the biggest problem is the marketing department doesn't get it.  Surface does not need to be compared to Apple products.  Trying to one up Apple is a waste of time.  Sell it on it's uniqueness, and what it does.  The Surface Pro is unlike any other device when you look at ALL it can do ... so why compare it ?  Focus on what it does best !   The biggest problem I see with Microsoft right now is they are letting down their existing client base, especially in the corporate world.  Everything is focused on change, and creativity, but companies large and small want to make transitions slowly and without everything falling apart.  I constantly get calls from clients with problems caused by periodic OS updates .. when something that worked perfectly ( ie. networking ) suddenly has major problems ... and no one at MSFT is providing any quality answers on how to resolve them.  Consumers are also employees ( and employers ), and they will look first at what they use at work for their personal needs ... and if it is creating headaches on the job, they look elsewhere.   What does Microsoft need to do ?  They need to get into the real world of semi-technical consumers, and see what people really want on a daily basis, and focus on that rather than all the creative stuff that some of us love, but is beyond the majority of those who have money to purchase these devices. 0 2 days ago Reply signal-2-noise It's just not the "cool factor" in their tech that's lacking, look at the human models in that cover photo.

Really wish they would port ONE game over - Kinect Party, Truly fun game for groups of kids. 0 2 days ago Reply Machine Overlord I'd like to add to Jason's welldone article and bring some more historical perspective, which I think is important. Apple While Apple is wildly successful today with it's iPhone-based platform, this wasn't always the case. Today's success for Apple started with the iPod, which took them 25 years to "discover". For Apple's first 25 years of existence, it was just a niche computer maker that struggled to be relevant. Even to this day, Apple's original core product, the Mac, has struggled to make much headway, holding the same single digit market share that it has held for decades. The iPod morphed into the iPod Touch, which morphed into the iPhone, then the iPad. Today, Apple's primary product is the iPhone. The iPad is slowly fading away, just as the iPod has. Without the iPhone, Apple would again be a niche computer maker struggling to be relevant because I would argue most of its Mac sales today are due to the success of the iPhone. Take the iPhone away and Apple again becomes irrelevant. Google Google is an advertising company. Roughly 90% of its revenue comes from selling advertising. Every product that Google creates is geared towards collecting user data to be sold. In 2007, Google purchased Android, which it subsequently allowed developers to use for free. This is the only reason Android became successful. It didn't become successful because it was originally good. Originally it was crap. The iPhone was originally crap as well. And I would argue up until the last few years it was crap. But it was free, which allowed every low rent device maker to turn out cheap, crap devices that most people could afford and that carriers could make massive profits on. And that was great for Google, because it gave them a massive platform from which to collect even more user data to sell. But to this day, the only device maker that makes any meaningful profit at all on Android is Samsung. There is profit for the carriers and app/service sales, but not in the devices themselves. Microsoft As Jason pointed out, Microsoft's history has been in the enterprise, and it will remain so. Neither Apple nor Google have any meaningful presence in the enterprise, other than iPhones and Android phones, and likely never will. The enterprise is a much more complex market than the consumer market. Enterprises demand much more robust systems, security, backwards compatibility, integration, etc., all things that neither Apple nor Google can provide at enterprise scale. Apple's success is the iPhone. Google's is advertising. Microsoft's is Windows, Office, Visual Studio, MS SQL Server, Intune, Xbox, Azure, and a host of other products, none of which Apple or Google have competitors for, and again likely never will. Microsoft has struggled in the consumer space because up until recently it has never been a consumer company. From day one both Apple and Android were consumer companies. They have decades of experience in the consumer, consumption market. They have little to no experience in the enterprise and productivity markets. Microsoft is just the reverse. So how does Microsoft become cool? I'm not sure it should. The idea that the iPhone and Android will remain the successes they are today is I think foolhardy. Looking back at the history of consumer electronics there are very few succcess of the day that even exist today. Things will change, and I think Microsoft is driving that change, but it is a longer term game. You might say, well Windows has been successful all these years, so perhaps Windows will become irrelevant at some point. Perhaps, but I don't think so, because unlike OSX, for example, Microsoft has spent the last few years completely re-writing Windows, completely changing its usability, its scalability. Windows can now run on desktops, laptops, tablets, Xbox, mobile, IoT, HoloLens, Surface Hub. OSX can run on Macs. It takes a completely separate operating system to run on the iPhone, and yet another to run on the iPad. Same goes for Google. Convergence is the future. The lines of what we call a "computer" continue to become blurred. Microsoft is leading the way with this convergence. Will it ever become cool? I don't know. But what I do know is that cool tends to be a fad. Fads don't last. 1 2 days ago Reply Migi2015 So Microsoft is 42 years in and can't get their first iPod.

Now, why would I get that questions? It s simply because of the commercial where the kids danced around and click the keyboard ontop the Surface. That was considered "cool."

Microsoft has tried for a long time to get users from all platforms.  They did the "it works on all devices but is best on Windows!" but didn't stick it out.  I think that's their problem.  Constantly here, and on other sites, we see people who are disinfranchised with them.  Especially "Windows fans" who really want to stay with them, but no longer have a choice.  Slowly, I'm running out of choices to stay with Microsoft.  And it's all their fault. 0 2 days ago Reply Gabriel Hernandez5 Thats why I think Microsoft should continue building smartphones but with an Android cloned OS, smartphones aren't going to dissapear anyrime soon.

I think it's the hardware. The Surface brand proved that impressive hardware is what you need to be successful. I'm pretty sure people buy phones for impressive hardware too like the iPhone was back in the day or the now leading Galaxy line from Samsung. Should Microsoft make a Windows phone with impressive hardware like they did with Surface, it'd probably get a lot more attention. 0 1 day ago Reply jmreuter Oh Lord, spare us from the "cool" nonsense.  Cool is fine if you want to be in the fashion business.  Follow that if you want to see how fickle it is.  Every time Microsoft tries to be "cool" they do it by copying, including copying the *worst* aspects of the others.  And when they change their existing products to be more "cool" they inevitably make them worse and, somehow, more buggy than what they started with. At work, I want to be productive and efficient, not cool.  Windows 7 was excellent at that.  The original Windows 8 screwed that up entirely.  Windows 10 if finally getting back to where they were with Windows 7. At home, I'm probably playing games, so it has to work and be fast.   Or I might doing something like photo and video downloads and edits, where again I want to be productive.  If I'm paying bills or other home chores, I'm likely just using a browser.  It just has to work, on whatever device.  Initially, about half of the time Edge didn't work.  Now it is worse: for some sites Edge fails, for others IE fails, so I have to use both, and try to remember which one to use for any given site. Windows Phone 7 was brilliant with it's hub idea--since abandoned.  But they also copied the worst aspect of iPhone in that you had to tether it to the Zune app, just like iPhone / iTunes, which everyone hates.  Stupid.  Zune HD was outstanding, as was the Zune player on Windows Phone 7, just too late.  And with Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 the replacement media playing environment was truly horrible; it would have been an embarrasment even as an intro college project.  How on earth did they go from something quite good to that?  With Groove they are finally getting back to what they had 5 years ago. When I'm mobile I'm trying to get something done; other than phone calls, it might be email, messaging, photos and photo sharing, social media, etc.  I just needs to work, without fights and reboots.  5 years ago it just worked.  Today it doesn't.  No fashion statement makes up for something simply not working.   0 2 days ago Reply AdamInTx This!!! Stop trying to be "cool" and just make a great device.  Also, people can tell genuine "cool" from contrived "cool."

Now, I think Microsoft has an opportunity for success. The true barrier they need to break is mobile. And I think gaming could be the way to break that barrier. Today they focus on the "business users" with their failed attempts at the"consumer" base. I think that if they also added a focus on the "gaming" crowd, by building the first ever gaming phone, they could finally on board the right people to achieve that "Cool Factor" that you so cleverly explain on this article. You could start slow, low key, with a killer piece of hardware (their ultimate mobile device), with the ability to play your current library of games - real games: Forza, Halo 5, etc. - on the go. Take your phone, your xbox controller (via bluetooh) and game on with your friends.

They also need to be able to take a product through multiple lifecycles and not just abandon them after first or second version.  Microsoft needs to take their ideas and nurture them, support them and give them a fighting chance.  Here's a great TV commercial from GE that shows how they love new ideas even if they seem unfriendly to everyone else.  It made me think GE is cool. https://www.ispot.tv/ad/7CyJ/general-electric-ideas-are-scary?autoplay=1 0 2 days ago Reply xFalk As I see it, Microsoft's biggest issues are being slow to market and lack of commitment (which includes marketing).

Kin, Zune, Windows Phone 7/8. Microsoft was innovating with some fantastic and beautiful user interface designs. I hope that they don't cower from innovation in the future. Windows 10 is increasingly using very tiny text instead of the visually stunning use of typefaces in Zune / Windows Phone. I've read rumours that the next mobile reboot might use boring icons like iOS and Android. Why is the general public so set in 25 year old UI design? It's time to evolve! I always used to say that Windows 8 / Windows Phone was like Marty McFly playing 80's heavy metal guitar in 1955. Unfortunately, people weren't ready for it yet. :( Don't conform to the generic status quo, Microsoft.

I think Microsoft is successful in designing ideas for software.  Back when they came out with the Metro design language, both Apple and Google adopted these concepts into their own iOS and Android UIs.  Personally, I loved the simplicity of Metro and felt most people just didn't give it a chance.  Now, it's everywhere. 1 2 days ago Reply JotaKa Because Windows 95 was a huge consumer success, and pretty much defined what a personal computer UI should look like.

I've long been in a tiny minority.  Microsoft has not only been slow to respond to trends (worse, with exception of the Surface Pro devices, have never been a trend-SETTER), they chase so many rabbit trails and then reboot their efforts there's no confidence in long-term sustainability.  I think we're about to witness it again with mobile.  Microsoft is the Incredible Hulk/Spiderman of the tech industry...so many retries at something, with a lot of money wasted and squandered consumer support. 4 2 days ago Reply xFalk I agree that there is nothing "fun" about an iPhone or Android phone, or really any phone for that matter.  It's the marketing that builds the perception of fun and that is what sells the devices. 1 2 days ago Reply Pappale not only marketing, applications are very important for the huge amount of average users, next group are geeks who want to see the newest HW so for both groups the only options are iPhones and Androids.

That said I'd agree that consistency is not there for all of their products. Apple has been very slow to response last couple of years for their entire portfolio. I'd argue it's worse now but it still pays off due to their (past) image. I'm not sure people see Google HW devices as that cool.

Same with Kinect.  My main TVs (three in total) that has an Xbox attached all have Kinect.  And Kinect works flawlessly for me.  It's no flop to me.  Again, just because Microsoft gets lazy and refuses to market their products wisely doesn't mean the products are flops.  It's the selling and promoting of the products is where the issue lies.  Windows Phone which should have been named something else IMO, was hampered by the name itself.  WP was at 10% in some countries and seem to be gaining ground until Microsoft decided to abandon all that was good with WP OS.  They got rid of the ME tile.  Rooms.  Panoramic Photo Hub.  Zune Music.  Kids Corner.  Reduction in integration of social sites in the People Hub.  Leader of the Camera in a cell phone.  And finally instead of leading they incorporated those useless Hamburger menus removing the ease of the ... ellipsis.  These things worked well!  They weren't flops!  They just won't marketed correctly IMHO. 0 2 days ago Reply vincentwansink It's true.  You can't rightfully call something a flop if it isn't marketed at all.  I guess you could say the promotion of the product was a flop, even if the product itself was brilliant. 1 2 days ago Reply Dillan K They may have been technically sound, but they were all market failures. That's the point:  for Microsoft to be successful in the consumer market, they need to be more than just technically proficient.  Just because you build a product that works, doesn't mean that it will find a successful market. All these products found limited success in the marketplace, but none of them met Microsoft's own expectations of success.  Thus, they were failures. 0 2 days ago Reply Manus Imperceptus Smack on about Windows Phone!

As for Mobile devices, the KIN failed because of a lot of Microsoft's politics but, one of the other big issues was Verizon wireless. They were exclusive on the KIN/KIN2  but, they insisted that it was a smartphone and put a mandatory $29.99 a month data plan, it got out of the range of most yonger people.  It was dead on arival because of this. If Windows was NOT a needed thing for PCs (If you read the story of how Bill Gates started Microsoft, you would know he was smart but, he was in the right place at the right time...), and another company created "Windows" Microsoft would be a low volume, or even failed company in a competive market. No matter the billions they spend on Marketing, they really have no clue on how to hit the "hip" consumers, they have always have lost this anagle.

Of course you don't have to read it if that's your desire. There are many other writers or topics here you might prefer. Just let the title of the piece and author by line be your guide if that’s what you wish. :-) Now I noticed your discontent with this and other pieces revolves around the erroneous notion that I am shilling for Apple and Google. Please review the dozens of articles I've written since I began writing for the site in 2015 www.windowscentral.com/author/jason-ward where you will clearly see that is not the case. One of the things that makes writing analysis for any company helpful is viewing that company within the larger context in which it exists. No company, not even Microsoft, exists in a box. Decisions made by other companies, consumer behavior, market forces, trends, technological advances, laws, government actions (remember the DOJ ruling against Microsoft?) and more affect the success and failure of a company's endeavors, even Microsoft's. For example Microsoft was in the mobile phone business long before Apple or Google. It had even achieved over 40% market share at one point. Clearly that level of market dominance is no longer the case. Why? Did Microsoft suddenly stop offering its mobile OS in 2007 or was there a force outside of Microsoft that began to affect its position in the mobile space? Of course we know that the latter is true. Apple introduced the consumer-facing iPhone which turned Microsoft's enterprise-focused efforts on its head. Microsoft had to scramble in response to what Apple and subsequently Google, via Android, brought to the market. Hhammack you can't tell one story without including (at least in part) the other. The same applies in various areas where Microsoft competes with other companies. Whether its offering a Music service - Groove vs Apple Music vs Google vs Spotify, Browsers: Edge vs Chrome vs Safari, OSes: Windows vs MacOS vs Chrome vs Android, productivity suites, cloud services, digital assistants, the list goes on. Talking about what the competition is doing provides context as to WHY Microsoft is doing WHAT it is doing and what is may do next and why. Rest assured, Microsoft is certainly taking about what rivals are doing behind the hallowed walls of Redmond. :-) So no I'm not shilling. :-) I'm telling the story as it should be told, by intelligently including information that provides context to the focus of the content. For any analysis and its communication to be most effective you have to look at the broader context not only the content, or subject that is the focus. I hope that helps you understand why I include information about what other companies are doing and why Windows Central hired me to write for the site. :-) 1 1 day ago Reply Long Xuyen MS continually makes one huge mistake in my not so humble opinion.

The shrinking of the PC to a small portable package a.k.a. Mobile has changed the consumer and business world forever.  These devices are becoming crucial to society and the lack of developer support for Windows will cripple MS for generations.   MS will win in business PC, compete in cloud and gaming, but losing in consumer mobile also means losing in Auto, Business, Payments and Financial, Home Automation, etc.  As an example, his week I had a business trip and a family members high school graduation.  I used my iPhone to check in on my flight, board my plane, open the door on my hotel, and navigate to my meetings with CarPlay.  Later I withdrew funds from an ATM with my phone, ordered pizzas for kids, and bought a coffee to keep me going.  The next day I purchased movie tickets and scanned in at the theater.   With my old Lumia 950 with Win 10 mobile I would've only been able to do 40% of this and it would have been a crappy experience.   MS should buy LG, Spotify and rebrand Sync with Cortana and a UWP experience.   0 15 hours ago Reply Stephen Townsley For me it's simple. Love. Google and Apple love mobile. They understand its the primary user platform in the consumer space now on which their vibrant consumer ecosystem links to it. With Microsoft it's a mere device category. The enthusiasm launching the Lumia 950 could not have been less. Having launched it they managed to make sure almost no one at Microsoft ever used it again. If they really loved the offer instead of seeing it merely as a necessary offer they might get somewhere. Do remember things like Zune and Kin were US only. Another problem for Microsoft is they need to morph into a global company. Apple and Google have done that. Microsoft not so much. With double figure Lumia sales in Europe during 2015 they abandoned their best selling markets first.  0 11 hours ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

It'll work on both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Google says that even ads it sells will be blocked on websites that don't get rid of annoying types of ads. By: AP | New York | Published:June 3, 2017 9:37 am Google says the feature will be turned on by default, and users can turn it off. It’ll work on both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Related News Google will pay upto $200,000 for finding a bug in Android OS Donald Trump pulls US out of Paris climate deal: Elon Musk to Tim Cook, top reactions from tech CEOs Google faces hefty EU fine in shopping service case Websites that run annoying ads such as pop-ups may find all ads blocked by Google’s Chrome browser starting next year. The digital-ad giant’s announcement comes as hundreds of millions of internet users have already installed ad blockers on their desktop computers and phones to combat ads that track them and make browsing sites difficult. These blockers threaten websites that rely on digital ads for revenue. Google’s version will allow ads as long as websites follow industry-created guidelines and minimize certain types of ads that consumers really hate. That includes pop-up ads, huge ads that don’t go away when visitors scroll down a page and video ads that start playing automatically with the sound on. Google says the feature will be turned on by default, and users can turn it off. It’ll work on both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Google says that even ads it sells will be blocked on websites that don’t get rid of annoying types of ads. But there might not be vast changes online triggered by the popular browser’s efforts. It’s a “small number of websites that are disproportionately responsible for annoying user experiences,” Google spokeswoman Suzanne Blackburn said. Google says that even ads it sells will be blocked on websites that don’t get rid of annoying types of ads. “I’m sure there are some publishers who will get hurt,” said Brian Wieser, an ad analyst with Pivotal Research Group. But in the long term, he says, cracking down on irritating ads should make the internet experience better, encouraging people to visit sites and click on links. That, in turn, benefits Google. The company is also starting a program that could help publishers deal with users who have downloaded popular ad blockers. Some individual websites have come up with their own countermeasures. Forbes.com, for example, won’t let you read stories without disabling your ad blocker or logging in with Facebook or Google accounts, so the site can track you. Google would work with websites to set up messages telling users to disable their blockers for the site or pay for a version of it with no ads. It’ll take a 10 percent cut of those payments. To protect its ad business, Google has tried to improve user experiences in other ways. It launched a way for websites to load faster on phones. And it used its sway as the dominant search engine to push companies to make their sites mobile-friendly. Such sites show up higher in mobile searches. Google also has tried to address advertisers’ concerns about their ads running next to offensive content by banning its ads from some objectionable videos on YouTube, like those that promote discrimination or advocate illegal drug use. Google also won’t place its ads on web pages with objectionable content — porn, for example, and or sites that promote suicide or violence. Facebook, too, is trying to make links from inside its universe less spammy for users. It says it’s trying to cut down on posts and ads in the news feed that lead to junky pages with “little substantive content” and “disruptive, shocking or malicious ads.” More Related News Nest security camera knows who’s home with Google face tech Apple WWDC 2017: Siri speaker is coming, to take on Google Home, Amazon Echo For all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App Tags: Google google chrome No Comments.

But how about a groundscraper? Google has unveiled plans for its new London HQ in King's Cross and, coming in longer than The Shard is tall, you can see where it gets its nickname from. As weird on the outside as it is on the inside. The eagle eyed will have realised that this isn't the first time Google has unveiled plans for a building in this very spot. The previous plans were ripped up after boss Larry Page deemed them 'too boring'. Second time lucky, perhaps? Plenty of room for retail therapy. We certainly think so. Designed to consolidate its London operation in one place, this giant development is the jewel in the crown of the King's Cross Central project. Google already has a small base here — their London YouTube Space sits next door. But this is an entirely different beast. In true Google style, this £1 billion office block adventure playground is filled with so much cool stuff, we'd be surprised if any of the 7,000 Googlers it's designed to house will ever want to leave. And why would you, with a verdant rooftop garden, complete with 200m running track and views like these? We can see our house from here. There are even plans for a half Olympic-sized swimming pool, for employees to cool off after a busy meeting in one of the various breakout spaces. Those preferring to work up a sweat can challenge co-workers to a game of basketball in the indoor sports hall, or opt for a solo workout session in the fully decked out gym. Show your boss who's boss on the basketball court. The 11-storey development will be lined with retail at ground level, making the King's Boulevard even more bustling than it's been of late. They've even found some room in this 870,000 sq ft beast for office space, so employees can actually get some work done. Don't mind the empty desks. The marketing team have gone for a dip in the pool. Previously due to open in 2016, work is now expected to start on site in 2018 if these latest plans are approved by Camden Council. It might be a while before anyone can move in... but we bet the lucky blighters are already counting the days. As for the rest of us? We can just gawk at how shiny and fun it all looks from the platforms at King's Cross, as we catch the 18:12 back home. These people are not jealous. Not at all.

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 83 Plus 1 on G+ 441 Share on Facebook 121 Share on Twitter Total Shares645 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Can get rid of those annoying app install ads when browsing on the phone! Corbin Davenport Yeah, I think those are included, since they stick to the top while scrolling. Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. My1 not really android related but when these things like get 10000 euro in a month easily show up in SKYPE, an application by MICROSOFT that hurts, and they even have HTTPS ads with certificate errors Eli Stevens I get the job done from convenience of my place, with very simple projects that only needs only from you a Desktop computer system as well as web connection and I am happier than before...

Cat Astrophy Deceptive is extremely hard to deal with and far more subjective. "Bad" can be virus ridden, or employing technical methods that can be detected automatically (like pop ups). Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. Cakefish ABP allows through Taboola, Outbrain and Revcontent. The polar opposite of acceptable ads. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... abc You can pay for it and I'll coast for free. Ha ha, I'm a dick! Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API Total Insecurity For some reason female users like this API... BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring My1 what the hell, how about they just pop a notif and let the phone do the rest? Imparus Okay so it was a bad example with facebook, since it is the notification API they are using not the vibration one, which means it follows the same rules as other applications. I should just have said a game might use it, but at the moment it is mainly used for BS ads. My1 okay, but I see no point in point in using the vibration on a website anyway. Imparus PWA, I mentioned game, since PWA is one of the new thing that is very likely to become huge in the next few years. Here you can try some few application made in it https://pwa.rocks/ so it is more that you should be ready for a paradigm change in what a website is, since the line between webapp and normal app will almost disappear. Example I use the QR scanner, so I don't have to have a dedicated app for it. My1 well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow. and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application. with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff Imparus I unfortunately don't have the time at the moment to explain all of these to you, so this will be quick rundown, and the rest you will have to research yourself if you are interested in it. "well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? " For most stuff it isn't a problem at all, as for game if they are simple enough optimization isn't as relevant. Most game would be written for an engine like unity or unreal, and one of the new thing in relation to PWA are modules, that will allow the use of engine like that, it also allow webapps to work completely offline. There will of course be some apps that are very heavy in computation on device that will make sense to run with native code that can run better, but there are being worked on optimizing things such as JS to make it run faster. "also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow." You can have the browser serve different code depending on the device, that actually isn't anything new. "and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. " PWA actually allow apps to work everywhere, instead of just the OS you coded it to. Having one single code base would be great for pretty much every company. "especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application." You can easily code for it to work offline, take the QR scanner on the side I linked you, I don't need internet to use it at all. Think of PWA like normal apps, if you use twitter then try using the PWA they have created. "with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff" Not really, this is one of the thing I will say you need to research yourself, since it will be quite a long explanation, I would start by looking into why chromeOS is more secure than Windows. I said there will be a huge grow with PWA over the next few years, since it is still very early in its development, only Firefox and Chrome support it at the moment and Edge will bring support in fall. AintaDamnThingFunny Right, but websites always ask me for permission if I want their notifications. Facebook using the vibrator API with your permission is one thing. Having an obtrusive add use it without your permission is another. Imparus That is because a website don't need to ask for permission, so it is more that Google should make it a permission check before allowing to use the vibration. Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! Rob Yeah, but some people love the vibrator API. hooch Holy shit I didn't even know this was a thing. Been using Firefox + uBlock Origin for a couple of years. blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. My1 cookie warning are annoying but it shows the scary relatity of all the sites that collect data with cookies. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Sonny Bono If they throw in free movies with the service I'd be down. I can already get anything I want on demand for no cost. I just appreciate watching random videos and I never know what I'm in the mood for. I'll just keep riding the links down the chain, bar tricks, gun porn, rocket engines, science experiments, old computers, animals and hunting videos... whatever it might be. ublock origin fixes the problem with ads - they don't exist any more - but not with popup windows on some questionable websites. abc Good for you. I use an adblocker and don't see any ads on Youtube. And I don't feel bad taking cents away from a multi-billion dollar corporation. I will never pay for streaming services because I like to own things. I could pay Netflix hundreds of dollars over the course of years, and the moment I disconnect, I am left with zero movies. I'd much rather grab some discs from the bargain bin. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Adam Margeson Forced Google surveys? Where are you seeing those served up? And, are you sure they're legitimately from Google? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but... Terra: how would you solve this on Chromecast, etc.?" tigerberry Playing a commercial WHILE PLAYING THE DAMN VIDEO I'M ACTUALLY WATCHING? Whoever came up with that should be forced to never use an adblocker ever again. Cakefish Wonderful. Please also add extension support to Android Chrome (it's the number 1 feature that it's missing, desktop Chrome wouldn't have been as popular without it) but this is a good start. Ghirahim Install Opera and have a wonderful life. Jun rip pornhub ads Rod I wonder when they will fix the Notification Download Service bug in v58. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719641# Rob Thank goodness. Somehow, we went from doing away with auto-play videos and ads years ago, only to have them pop up a lot in recent months. I'm sick of them. BC Google is finally making a move that I truly approve of. Ads, especially the invasive ones have really taken over. I don't care about banner ads that I see just once or ads on the side. The ones that infuriate me the most are those that obscure content, automatically play loud sounds/videos. Those that try to trick the user into installing something they don't obviously need, need to die in a fire. It's why I've installed Ghostery and use Mercury Reader to banish that bullshit to the depths of the internet hell. I'm also pleased that Google is being smart about this and blocking all invasive content...Even if it comes directly from their company because they need to be impartial and control these insanely bad adverts. Forcing a standard will hopefully make the internet a cleaner place, one that can support the advert model without being deliberately invasive or deceptive. Dragos Lucian The only thing that makes me use an adblocker on a lot of websites, is because, more often than not, you don't even need to click on the ads to be presented with a buttload of new tabs or individual pages. You just need to click on a blank area and boom ! You can barely make your way back to the page you initially were. If those type of ads go away, then I'll make sure to uninstall my adblocker. Till then, fuck everyone who posts those type of ads on their websites in order to gain revenue. Make your money off selling socks. Abhishek Mittal Does this mean my phone wont start buzzing and downloading unwanted apps without my permission? This is huge, a great step by google in improving quality of the internet Spinkick Does it bother anyone that google is the one that decides which ads are bad? abc Google means that they are going to block their competitors ads and only allow their own.

That’s why we joined the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group dedicated to improving online ads,” said Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google’s senior vice president for advertising in a blog post on Thursday. “In dialogue with the Coalition and other industry groups, we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018.” Google’s move, in the works for some time, could end up reducing some ads served and impact its own revenue, but it aims to improve the overall web experience and discourage third-party ad-blockers that could have a more dramatic impact. Ramaswamy noted that “annoying” ads prompt some people to use ad-blockers that stop all advertising content, hurting revenue for content creators. “The vast majority of online content creators fund their work with advertising,” Ramaswamy said. “That means they want the ads that run on their sites to be compelling, useful and engaging — ones that people actually want to see and interact with.” But he noted that “it’s far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web — like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page.” Google is a founding member of the Coalition, which was formed last year and aims to maintain the online advertising ecosystem while eliminating ads that many find irritating. The group released guidelines earlier this year for ads on both mobile and desktop. But some analysts say it will be difficult for Google and others to set standards that please all parties. “It’s smart for Google to be part of the push for limited ad blockers even if that may seem counterintuitive, because if it can focus that activity on egregious ads rather than all ads indiscriminately, it has a much better shot at protecting its own massive ad revenue than if others take more of a blanket approach,” said Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “We can be certain that none of Google’s own sites or ad formats will be affected by this filter, but we can also guess that there will be something of an outcry from publishers feeling that Google is favouring itself while disadvantaging others. It’s going to be fascinating to watch this play out over the next few months.” According to the research firm eMarketer some 27.5 per cent of US internet users will use ad blockers this year. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week After London attack, Facebook says aims to be ‘hostile environment’ for terrorists Smart cities to take centre stage at CES 2018 Snapchat’s ‘Spectacles’ go on sale in Europe A new era for Nokia Apple set to expand Siri, taking different route from Amazon’s Alexa (VIDEO) A new era for Nokia Will Samsung's new notebooks write a new chapter?

Digital Trends Home > Home > Google Home is coming to Canada and is finally… Google Home is coming to Canada and is finally available for pre-order By Lulu Chang — Updated June 2, 2017 12:37 pm Subscribe Share Google Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Google is finally giving our northern neighbors a present in the form of Google Home, which will speak both French and English. Google Home has been helping Americans manage their households for over a year now, and finally, other countries will be able to get in on the fun, too. Our neighbors to the north can now pre-order the smart home hub, either from Google’s online store or from one of the company’s retail partners, including Best Buy. The California Silicon Valley company initially made the announcement regarding Google Home’s Canadian availability at I/O earlier in 2017 but now, Canada’s waiting game is over. You will be able to buy one of these hubs for $179 CDN (about $132.50), which is about what the hubs are selling for stateside. It will take about two to three weeks for you to get your Google Home at home if you order from Google’s online store and the company noted in its official blog  that the Home will be available at retail on June 26. Of course, it could pay off to buy a little early, as Best Buy will give you a free Chromecast if you place an order now. Because Google knows who its Canadian audience is, the associated virtual assistant (Google Assistant) will speak both English and French. Users will be able to access Google’s entire suite of resources, including Search, Maps, and Translate, and will also be able to stay up to date on weather, traffic, finance, news, sports, and local businesses. Google Home can also play music, manage users everyday tasks, serve as a speaker, and of course, control your smart home. “Spending quality time with our family and friends at home is important,” Google writes on its blog. “What if technology could make the most of those special moments by helping us get things done?” Canada, now is your chance to answer that question.
Digital Trends Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 review Xiaomi’s affordable Mi Pad 3 is a tablet everyone can enjoy Share Xiaomi's Mi Pad 3 excels at the essentials, but is overshadowed by Apple’s cheap new iPad. Xiaomi's Mi Pad 3 excels at the essentials, but is overshadowed by Apple’s cheap new iPad. Xiaomi's Mi Pad 3 excels at the essentials, but is overshadowed by Apple’s cheap new iPad. Highs Hits the tablet size sweet spot at 7.9-inches High-resolution screen Attractive design Lows Frustrating software and operation quirks Mediocre camera DT Editors' Rating 6.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Tablet Reviews > Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 review By Andy Boxall Posted on 06.02.17 Research Center: Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 Do tablets still have a place in the world? They’re not the trend they once were, and even Apple — the one company making tablets that sell in any quantity — has dropped the price on its 2017 entry-level iPad model to encourage people to buy or upgrade. At $330, the iPad is an all-around affordable option, but you’ll have to search for an Android tablet if you want something cheaper. Xiaomi has released a new version of its Mi Pad, called the Mi Pad 3. It’s an iPad Mini-sized device with Xiaomi’s MIUI user interface over the top of Google’s operating system. It’s cheaper than the iPad Mini 4 and the new iPad, at around $270; but you’ll have to import one if you want it in the U.S. Is it worth the import? No. While there’s nothing horribly wrong with the Mi Pad 3, its small quirks and issues do not justify the $270 price tag, especially when the new iPad is just $60 more. Let’s take a closer look. This looks familiar What does the Mi Pad 3 look like? Well, picture an iPad Mini 4 without the Apple branding, and you’re pretty much there. The two are shockingly similar. The 6.9mm thick aluminum body has a flat back with a camera lens in the top right, the corners are smooth and rounded, and the overall dimensions are almost identical. The screen is the same size at 7.9-inches, as is the 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution. Andy Boxall Andy Boxall Andy Boxall Andy Boxall There are some differences. The dual speakers are mounted on the back of the tablet, facing away from you when looking at the screen, and the sleep/wake button is on the side of the body, not the top. It doesn’t have a fingerprint sensor, or any physical home button — instead the Mi Pad 3 uses capacitive navigational icons below the screen. We miss the tactility of a physical home button, largely because  the Android keys aren’t especially responsive, and do require very precise taps to operate. It’s a comfortable device to hold, and those with average or larger hands will have no problem holding it in one hand, thanks to its low weight. The texture on the back is pleasant to touch, but although the Mi Pad 3 is beautifully made, there is a slight flex in the center of the aluminium back panel. It’s not enough to cause concern, but enough to notice when it’s pressed. There’s little to fault the way the Mi Pad 3 looks, mainly because it’s very close to the established and attractive style of the iPad Mini. It’s not something that overly concerns us — styling it after something hideous would do that — and we find the smaller 7.9-inch tablet size to be convenient, while still being suitably larger than our phone to make using it worthwhile. Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 Compared To Apple iPad 9.7 Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 Chuwi Hi12 Windows 10 2-in-1 Dell Venue 8 7000 Nvidia Shield Tablet Apple iPad Air 2 LG G Pad 7.0 Dell Venue 8 Pro Apple iPad Mini 2 Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 (8-inch) Smart Devices SmartQ U7 Barnes & Noble Nook HD+ Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus Amazon Kindle Fire Acer Iconia Tab A100 Crisp screen that needs better color calibration Xiaomi’s Mi Pad 3 has a 7.9-inch, 2048 x 1536 pixel, IPS LCD screen on the front, which is good enough for a 326 pixel-per-inch density, and a wide 178-degree viewing angle. It’s very bright, and we rarely needed to increase the brightness over 50 percent, which is good for battery life. There’s a reading mode for nighttime use, which lowers the amount of sleep-damaging blue light emitted by the screen. It’s easily activated from the Android notification shade, and adds a yellowish look to the display, but there’s a slider to adjust the degree of intrusion. Dig through the menu and you’ll find an unusual black and white mode, which not only extends the battery life, but does a decent job of reducing eye strain when reading. The Mi Pad 3’s size really does make it a great video-consuming machine. The screen’s color and contrast can be tweaked under a separate menu, and we found it was worth taking the time to calibrate. Out of the box, in standard configuration, the whites didn’t appear crisp enough; but things improved when the display was switched to “cool.” Everyone will see it differently, which is why we welcome the chance to tailor the display’s look to our own taste. Playing HD video from Netflix and Crunchyroll produced great images filled with color, and while we enjoyed the viewing experience, the 4:3 aspect ratio adds black bars to the top and bottom of most videos.  Still, the Mi Pad 3’s size really does make it a great video-consuming machine. It’s not too big that it’s annoying to hold, but is still much more watchable than a 5.5-inch screen on a phone. Text looks excellent — crisp and well-defined — especially when browsing the web and reading ebooks. The screen looks great, but we have one annoyance. The tablet doesn’t compensate for your palm resting on one side while scrolling with another finger. At first, it’s like the touchscreen isn’t working at all, then you realize it’s because the hand you’re holding the tablet with is also touching the edge of the screen. Remove it, and everything’s fine. Other times, it can activate certain features. It depends on how you’re holding the Mi Pad 3 — so doesn’t happen all the time — but when it does it’s highly irritating. Fluid software, few tablet-friendly apps Our Mi Pad 3 came with Android 7.0 Nougat installed, complete with an Android security patch from February, and Xiaomi’s global MIUI version 8.2, so everything is in English. Google Play and associated apps came pre-installed on our imported Mi Pad 3, along with a variety of standard apps including a calendar, a weather app, a calculator, an FM radio, and a browser. Surprisingly, the tablet offers a slightly different user experience to a Xiaomi phone. Because it’s very smooth, and MIUI is supremely uncluttered, the tablet has a very Apple-like feel to it. The menus aren’t messy and it’s not filled with superfluous apps, making fast, daily use a pleasure. The most obvious additional feature Xiaomi has added is a widget page, viewable by swiping right on the main home screen. The widgets can be altered to your preference, making it a handy and attractively presented shortcut page. Using Netflix, YouTube, popular games, Google apps, and several big-name social network apps downloaded from the Google Play store provide a tablet-friendly experience, but stray too far from the best known apps, and things aren’t so good. You don’t even have to look that hard either, the Instagram app doesn’t feel like it has been adapted for use on a tablet very well, for example. The more obscure, or dated, your favourite app is, the less likely it’ll look that fantastic on the Mi Pad 3. This isn’t a problem with the device, but a problem with Android on tablets as a whole. There are other quirks unique to the Mi Pad 3. Even though it runs Android 7.0 Nougat, there’s no split window multi-tasking available with MIUI 8. Adequate performance Xiaomi previously used an Intel processor for its Mi Pad tablet, but this time it has chosen a MediaTek chip — the MT8176 — to power its slate, along with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage space. It’s not a common processor, having been used in few mainstream tablets sold in the U.S. and Europe. Put through some benchmarking workouts, the scores are uninspiring. In our general use, the MediaTek chip performed adequately, happily powering games such as Danmaku Unlimited in HD mode, and casual titles like Crossy Road. Graphically-intensive and faster-paced games like Reckless Racing put some strain on the tablet, and slow downs did occur. Put it through some benchmarking workouts, and the scores are uninspiring. AnTuTu returned a score of 74,646, and 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme gave it just 749. The Intel Atom-powered Lenovo Yoga Book managed 1,192, for comparison. Unfortunately, there’s no MicroSD memory expansion, and 32GB of internal memory isn’t very much. Be prepared to slim down movie and music collections stored on the device itself, or stick with streaming services. There is a 3.5mm headphone socket though, and the 6,600mAh battery is charged through a USB Type-C port. We’ve been using the Mi Pad 3 for almost two weeks, and it has needed charging twice, not including the initial charge. Leaving it on standby overnight saw around 7 or 8-percent of the battery disappear. Mediocre camera The rear camera on the Mi Pad 3 is packed with 13 megapixels, autofocus, and an f/2.2 aperture. It’s highly unlikely the Mi Pad 3 will ever be someone’s primary camera, and it’s probably a good thing. The pictures it takes are only acceptable, and nothing more. Colors do pop, and plenty of detail is revealed zooming in on close-up images; but it doesn’t have an HDR mode, and overcast skies were washed out. Around the front, there’s a 5-megapixel camera with the same aperture, and it’s good for video calls and selfies. Warranty, availability, and price The Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 isn’t sold in the U.S. or Europe, and must be imported through a specialist. Our review Mi Pad 3 was supplied by Geekbuying, a well-known importer of Chinese electronics. At the time of writing it costs $270 with free shipping. The tablet was sent to us with a courier, did attract a small customs charge in the U.K., and arrived securely packaged. Geekbuying offers a one-year warranty on the products it sells, including tablets, but doesn’t cover them if there has been water damage, mistreatment, or abuse. It’ll repair returned hardware for free within the warranty period, and has a warehouse in California that can be used instead of sending the device back to China. To take advantage of this, a $3 charge has to be paid at checkout during the original purchase. There’s also an English-speaking customer service helpline available. Our Take Unlike the company’s smartphones and their lack of wide U.S. network support, the Mi Pad 3 is a premium Xiaomi product everyone can enjoy, and its screen is great for video and reading. Is there a better alternative? The Mi Pad 3’s natural competitor is the Apple iPad Mini 4, which is at least $130 more; however, potential tablet buyers should really be looking at the new 2017 9.7-inch iPad, which starts at $330. That’s close enough to the Mi Pad 3’s price to make it attainable, and the iPad has a far more varied catalog of fully tablet-compatible apps that makes it a wiser choice if you’re planning to use the device a lot. We’d strongly recommend the iPad. If you’d prefer not to buy an Apple product, our favourite Android tablet at the moment is the Galaxy Tab S3, but this is more than twice the price of the Mi Pad 3. Outside of this, the world’s awash with mediocre to average Android tablets, including the $300 Samsung Galaxy Tab A and the Asus ZenPad Z10, or even the $135 Amazon Fire 8. We wouldn’t recommend any of them in particular, and feel the Mi Pad 3 is a more premium device that’s at least on a par with the Galaxy Tab A, provided you’re happy to import one. How long will it last? The Mi Pad 3 isn’t water resistant, but the body is well-built and the metal back won’t shatter if it gets accidentally knocked. That said, if you’re planning on handing the Mi pad 3 over to your kids, you may want to find a sturdy child-proof case. Xiaomi isn’t the fastest with supplying Android version updates, as they usually require its UI to be reworked first, which takes time. This does change if you’re happy to use Xiaomi beta releases though, but we doubt everyone will be happy to do so. Tablets aren’t the same as phones, and rarely need replacing. A three-year old tablet is far more capable than a three-year old smartphone. Many tablet owners just want to play video, browse the web, and check social media accounts. For this, the Mi Pad 3 will last for some time. Should you buy it? No. There’s nothing horribly wrong with the pretty, fast, and capable Mi Pad 3, but with Apple offering the new iPad for only $330, there’s not much of a reason to go for the Mi Pad 3. If Apple is a dirty word in your household, then it’s a different story, and the Mi Pad 3 stacks up nicely against the many similar options out there.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Weekly Rewind: Apple’s Siri speaker, solar… Weekly Rewind: Apple’s Siri speaker, solar startups, Charlize Theron’s ‘Atomic Blonde’ By Lulu Chang — Updated June 2, 2017 12:11 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: A lot can happen in a week when it comes to tech. The constant onslaught of news makes it nigh impossible for mere mortals with real lives to keep track of everything. That’s why we’ve compiled a quick and dirty list of this week’s top 10 tech stories, from what to expect from WWDC to a Tesla-inspired pet carrier — it’s all here. Apple’s ‘Siri speaker’ may debut as early as next week It seems as if we’re just a few days away from Apple unveiling a Siri-enabled speaker similar to Amazon’s range of Echo devices and Google’s Home offering. The Cupertino company has started manufacturing the device, “people familiar with the matter” told Bloomberg this week, and it could be shown off during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference which kicks off in San Jose, California, on June 5. However, anyone keen to get their hands on the Siri-controlled smart speaker may have to exercise some patience, as the sources said it won’t be ready to ship until “later in the year.” Read the full story here. First clip from Charlize Theron’s ‘Atomic Blonde’ is as brutal as it is beautiful The first trailer for Charlize Theron’s upcoming film Atomic Blonde did not skimp on the action, so it’s no surprise that the first full clip from the July movie is one long, frantic, and impressively brutal fight sequence. But if that’s the sort of scene you can appreciate, the clip really is a fantastic thing to behold. Directed by John Wick co-director David Leitch (who’s also helming the upcoming Deadpool sequel), Atomic Blonde casts Academy Award winner Theron as a secret agent who will use anything at her disposal to complete a mission. The film’s script was penned by Kurt Johnstad (300, Act of Valor), and is based on the graphic novel The Coldest City, created by writer Antony Johnston and illustrator Sam Hart. Read the full story here. This Tesla-inspired pet carrier lets your cat seethe in style Pet carriers are usually more functional than fashionable, but Waul Studio wants to change that. Inspired by a Devon Rex cat named Marvin who looks like a “little alien,” the team decided to make an ergonomic pet carrier that suited him. Waul Studio debuted a carrier that resembles a spaceship on Kickstarter in May, and the campaign quickly exceeded its initial goal. The futuristic product doesn’t just look unique — it is designed to be more comfortable for both the pet that rides in it and the person who carries it. One of the upgrades animals will appreciate is an interior space that is designed to keep them entertained. Not only can they see outside the clear door, but there is also a built-in toy at the front of the carrier. A swirl-patterned ball in a track, the toy is meant to attract the animal’s attention and maintain it. Read the full story here. Amazon’s new retail bookstores have all of the books, but none of the charm Large book chains like Barnes & Noble have been shutting down bookstores for a decade now, which makes it a peculiar day when a new bookstore opens up in the heart of New York City. Even odder, it’s a physical store from Amazon, the online retailer whose Kindle ebook reader is a prime culprit in bookstore declines in the first place. But Amazon is always up to the task of transforming traditional experiences into opportunities that require you to use technology. Opening a physical bookstore may seem strange in 2017, but it’s no different than the release of Dash buttons or the opening of Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh food outlets. Amazon isn’t just on the web these days, it’s everywhere. Sadly, it has yet to learn what makes a bookstore great. Walking into NYC’s first Amazon Books location — the seventh bookstore it has opened nationwide — the 4,000 square foot space is packed with books, but barely feels like a bookstore. Sure, there are rows of books separated by genre, from Young Adult novels to cookbooks; and the space looks big, carrying thousands of titles, but it feels as packed as a train car during rush hour. The maze of bookshelves and extremely tiny seating area leaves no room to hide and zone out with a stack of comics or relax and absorb yourself in the prologue of a new novel.

Squeeze more out of your workouts with the best compression gear While many of the popular shooting sleeves we’ve seen slowly dominate NBA fashion as of late may be purely for aesthetic purposes, there are numerous pieces of compressive clothing on the market that come with actual kinesiological functionality. Compression gear increases blood flow to the muscles and may even minimize lactic acid build up, allowing you to recover faster while minimizing soreness during and after a workout. Although MIT researchers are already working on the next generation of microbial-enhanced “living clothing” to boost performance, there are plenty of compression garments currently available. From products designed to keep you cool during a workout, to responsive fiber networks designed to aid mobility and joint support, here are seven of our favorite pieces of compression gear.

Audi snags the first automated vehicle testing license in New York Fresh off its announcement at CES 2017 of a self-driving car by 2020, Audi said Wednesday that New York state had approved its application to test autonomous vehicles. The license is for Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) Level 3 vehicles, which is reserved for cars capable of automated driving at highway speeds if certain conditions are met. To satisfy New York state regulations, two trained engineers will be in the car at all times, one in the driver’s seat and another in the back. These engineers will monitor the system and ensure the car is operating safely. So far, the company says the company has logged “thousands of miles” in its concept cars without an incident. Audi is the first automobile manufacturer to win a license to operate autonomous cars in the state, less than a month after Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the state would begin accepting applications. The test period runs through April 1, 2018, but comes with some fairly onerous stipulations to participate. Read the full story here. Switzerland’s new ‘air-scrubbing’ plant sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere A company in Switzerland recently unveiled the world’s first commercial so-called “air-scrubbing” plant designed to capture atmospheric carbon dioxide. At the 2015 Paris climate conference, 195 countries adopted the legally binding global climate deal aimed at limiting the rise in temperature to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit and air-scrubbing technologies are pivotal to this overall objective. The first of its kind direct air capture (DAC) unit utilizes 18 Climeworks carbon dioxide collectors on top of a waste utilization plant, KEZO, to filter CO2 from the atmosphere. This concentrated CO2 is then supplied to a greenhouse — located just a quarter mile down the road — where it is used as fertilizer to grow tomatoes and cucumbers. The DAC itself is powered by low-grade waste heat generated by the KEZO complex.

Google uses ‘Wonder Woman’ to inspire next generation of female programmers A recent study co-published by Google and Gallup states that just 48 percent of girls between seventh and 12th grade are “very confident” they could learn computer science, compared to 65 percent of boys. Clearly there’s an imbalance that has pervaded the field. And although tech companies have made strides in terms of representation, there’s still much work ahead. Even Google, it must be said, has come under fire in recent years for failing to do enough to fix the lack of diversity within its walls — especially where equal pay is concerned. And that brings us to this week. On Friday, Wonder Woman hits theaters, and Google is using the opportunity to take action. Read the full story here. Dragonflies are being genetically engineered into cybernetic drones Cybernetic insects may sound like something out of dystopian fiction, but they’re being developed in labs around the world. And their uses may be more beneficial than you’d expect. Some researchers have proposed remote-controlled insects for surveillance, while others think they can help sniff out explosives and aid in search and rescue missions. Up until now, these insects have mainly been controlled by firing electrical impulses through electrodes plugged into the little invertebrate — a technique that’s been effective but clunky and energy hungry.  Now engineers at Draper and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) at Janelia Farm have begun work on DragonflEye, a project to develop a more sophisticated technique that may usher in an evolution for cybernetic insects.

Startup’s solar roof is cheaper, more efficient, and easier to install than Tesla’s solar tiles The solar roofing competition is heating up, and one company in particular is looking to challenge Tesla head-on. Californian upstart Forward Labs has its own solar roof design, and not only is it cheaper than Tesla’s, but it allegedly installs in half the time as well. Technologically speaking, Forward Labs’s solar roof is slightly different than Tesla’s. The startup’s innovative design uses monocrystalline solar cells, which have a higher energy density than most other solar products. As such, these solar cells can achieve 19 watts per square foot compared to 11W per square foot for other solar cells. Aesthetically, the overall design of the Forward Labs roof is notably different from Tesla’s as well. The Tesla roof is designed to mimic the classic rooftop shingle model, with each solar shingle made from three basic layers: a solar cell, a masking film, and a top layer of tempered glass. Conversely, Forward Labs’s design uses a single, fully-integrated standing-seam metal design with a similar tempered glass top layer. Read the full story here.
Digital Trends Home > Computing > Everything you need to know about Google’s… Everything you need to know about Google’s Chromecast and Chromecast Ultra By Ryan Waniata — Updated June 2, 2017 5:01 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Update: Added new updates to the Google Home app, new available live TV streaming apps, and other timely information.  Google’s first foray into the world of streaming devices, the Chromecast, was a complete knockout when it debuted in 2013. Since then, Google has continued to update its streaming device for the future, including a faster new version of its original dongle and an audio-only version, as well as the Chromecast Ultra for 4K Ultra HD support. Whichever version you use, the small device remains just as convenient as ever, providing you with a simple way to cast your favorite TV shows, music, and movies from a mobile device or computer to the big screen (or speaker) of your choice. While Chromecast’s popularity has spread far and wide already, those who have yet to be initiated into its world may still have a lot of questions about how Chromecast works and what it can do. We cover all of that below, along with some very handy apps you’ll want in your arsenal, so follow along to get your Chromecast on. What is Chromecast and how does it work? Chromecast devices run a simplified version of Google’s Chrome OS, and have limited memory and hardware specs. However, they don’t need to have a ton of power because they aren’t much more than glorified gateways to streaming content. To use a Chromecast, you simply plug it into your TV’s HDMI port and connect to your home’s internet network following the simple instructions provided. The device then acts as a portal for your favorite streaming apps on your mobile device to be “cast” onto your TV. Google Chromecast Here’s how casting works: Using apps on your mobile device or computer, you essentially hand off — or cast — content to the Chromecast by tapping the Chromecast symbol (a square with wavy lines in the corner) from within the app. Using the information it receives about what you want to watch, the Chromecast finds the TV show or movie on the web and streams it directly from the service to the TV. This way, your mobile device’s resources aren’t hogged up by streaming tasks, and battery life doesn’t take a huge hit. Think of your mobile device as a remote control for the Chromecast. One exception to this rule is when the Chromecast mirrors your Chrome browser on your computer. In this case, the Chromecast is depending entirely on your computer as the source for what it displays. The other exception is an app called AllCast, which we dig into a little bit further down. Introducing the Chromecast family If you haven’t yet entered the world of 4K Ultra HD TVs, the $35 version of the Chromecast is still your best bet. The device comes in three distinct colors — black, coral, and lemonade — and features three built-in antennas, a malleable HDMI cord, and support for 802.11ac and 5 GHz bands. Chromecast Ultra For those looking to step into the future of high-resolution content, the $69 Chromecast Ultra may be a better fit. The Chromecast Ultra brings more than just a higher pixel count to your streaming toolkit — along with 4K Ultra HD support, the device supports the two most popular versions of HDR (including HDR10 and Dolby Vision), to work with virtually any 4K HDR-ready TV. HDR content allows for deeper contrast, brighter highlights, and richer color shading. It is widely regarded as a key element to making 4K shows and movies look more realistic and engaging. The Chromecast Ultra also adds Ethernet support for a stronger, more stable connection. Google claims the device is “1.8” times faster than its streaming sibling, which checked out in our review. The company has begun adding 4K Ultra HD movies to Google Play, a nice addition that will join Netflix and YouTube as top sources supporting 4K Ultra HD resolution, though Netflix will charge you a bit more to get access to its 4K library. Google Chromecast Audio Jeffrey Van Camp/Digital Trends Finally, Google’s Chromecast Audio offers a simple way to turn virtually any powered speaker into an audio streaming device. Similar to its video-streaming family members, the Chromecast Audio “casts” audio from streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, and many others. However, instead of an HDMI connection, the Chromecast Audio connects via 3.5mm audio jack, or via a digital Optical input (though you’ll need an additional mini-Toslink adapter or cable to do so). For this guide, we’ll be talking about the video-ready Chromecast devices, but you can find out more about Chromecast Audio here. Which devices work with Chromecast? Google’s Chromecast devices are supported by Android tablets and smartphones, iPads and iPhones, and Chrome for Windows and Mac OS X.

Continuing their long record of support for equality, major employers Citibanamex, Accenture, Google, Kellogg and Mastercard have already committed to participate in the Mexico-focused survey and report. The survey was announced at an event on May 23 hosted by Citibanamex and comes during a time of significant progress in LGBTQ workplace inclusion around the globe. In the coming months, Mexico-based HRC Equidad MX will collect responses to the survey, which will run parallel to HRC's annual Corporate Equality Index (CEI) survey (http://www.hrc.org/campaigns/corporate-equality-index), and release the results during the Fall of 2017. The forthcoming report will evaluate major Mexican business and multinational companies on three core pillars of LGBT inclusion: o Adoption of nondiscrimination policies; o Creation of employee resource groups or diversity and inclusion councils; o Engagement in public activities to support LGBT inclusion. Highly rated employers will receive a designation similar to the 'Best Places to Work' certification offered through the CEI. 'Businesses around the world continue to lead for LGBT equality,' said Mary Beth Maxwell, HRC's Vice President for Programs, Research and Training. 'From the companies taking the Equidad MX survey on inclusion to the HRC Global Business Coalition raising the bar, private sector partners around the world are sending a clear message that equality and inclusion are good for business.' 'Having these five important companies support this effort by the Human Rights Campaign represents a significant step in raising awareness of workplace equality among Mexican companies,' said Deena Fidas, Director of HRC's Workplace Equality Program. 'Mexico is a great commercial and social partner for the United States, and replicating the work we have done with companies over the past 15 years in the U.S. through our Corporate Equality Index will be a watershed moment for Mexican and multinational companies operating here.' 'Citibanamex is an institution committed to giving the best of Mexico and the best in the world to our clients and employees. This commitment goes hand in hand with respect and job inclusion of the LGBT population,' said Liliana Iñigo, Citibanamex's LGBT Ambassador for Latin America and Citibanamex's Executive Director of Marketing. 'We establish a culture that promotes integrity and confidence so that our collaborators can enhance their talent, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Participating in the HRC Equidad MX certification shows the conviction we have to build the best working environment for the LGBT population in Mexico and in our Financial Group.' 'Accenture is an inclusive company that promotes an environment of trust and motivates each one of its members to be authentic. We are proud to be a multinational firm that works every day to provide a fair work environment, regardless of the sexual orientation or gender identity of the people. With this, we formally declare our commitment to continue working towards the LGBT inclusion supported by the HRC Equity MX certification,' said Jorge Torres, Accenture's Chief Technology Officer. 'Google's mission is to organize information and make it accessible and useful for everyone. In this sense, our search for diversity is a natural extension of this mission as we seek to increase access to opportunities, breaking down barriers and empowering people through technology,' said Delfina Grossi, Google Marketing Solutions Manager and Diversity Ambassador for Google Mexico. 'Kellogg seeks to foster a culture of inclusion for all its employees and generate a work environment in which people are appreciated and can be authentic,' said Guillermo González Guerra, Director of Human Resources at Kellogg Latin America. 'Through its K-Pride & Allies program, the company works to become the employer of choice for the LGBT community by promoting equity, solidarity and respect. Getting the HRC Equidad MX badge will be a very important step in this regard.' 'Mastercard is proud to participate in HRC's Global Business Coalition and to promote inclusive and diverse corporate culture with different actions that reinforce our commitment with our most important capital, the human and in the community in which we work,' said Brenda Hernandez, Director of Human Resources for Mastercard Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Accenture, Google and Mastercard are members of HRC's Global Business Coalition (http://www.hrc.org/resources/global-business-coalition), a cohort of global employers publicly committed to inclusion everywhere they do business. Through its Corporate Equality Index (http://www.hrc.org/campaigns/corporate-equality-index), the HRC Foundation has established a roadmap for the adoption of LGBTQ-inclusive policies, benefits and practices across major corporations. Last year, for the second year in a row, HRC launched its international CEI in Mexico City along with the U.S. Embassy in Mexico, The Dow Chemical Company, J.P. Morgan Chase, and the Mexican state-owned petroleum company, PEMEX. In conjunction with the launch of the 2017 CEI, HRC Equidad MX released a Spanish-language toolkit for workplaces in Mexico and around Latin America. The guide provides predominantly Spanish-language workplaces with a resource to help train and equip employees to build LGBT-inclusive environments. HRC Equidad MX: Global Workplace Equality Program, which launched last year, works to increase awareness about the importance of LGBTQ diversity and inclusion in Mexico's workplaces by developing consulting and education models for Mexican companies and organizations. It also utilizes HRC's tools and relationships to engage interested companies in aligning their corporate policies on LGBTQ inclusion to international standards.

The Human Rights Campaign Foundation is the educational arm of America's largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people. HRC envisions a world where LGBTQ people are embraced as full members of society at home, at work, and in every community. Courtesy of the Human Rights Campaign HRC Equidad México: Programa Global de Igualdad en los Centros de Trabajo lanza una encuesta innovadora sobre inclusión LGBT en centros laborales para empleadores en México La iniciativa cuenta con un fuerte apoyo corporativo, resaltando el éxito del Índice Corporativo de Igualdad de HRC CIUDAD DE MÉXICO - La Fundación Human Rights Campaign, el brazo educativo de la organización de derechos civiles de personas lesbianas, gais, bisexuales, transgénero y queer (LGBTQ) más grande de Estados Unidos, anunció que HRC Equidad MX: Programa Global de Igualdad en los Centros de Trabajo, está llevando a cabo una encuesta innovadora sobre las políticas y prácticas inclusivas de personas LGBT en las empresas mexicanas. Siguiendo con su larga trayectoria de apoyo a la igualdad, los principales empleadores Citibanamex, Accenture, Google, Kellogg y Mastercard ya se han comprometido a participar en la encuesta y el informe centrados en México. La encuesta fue anunciada en un evento organizado 23 de mayo por Citibanamex y llega durante un tiempo de progreso significativo de la inclusión LGBTQ en el lugar de trabajo en todo el mundo. En los próximos meses, HRC Equidad MX, con sede en México, recogerá las respuestas de la encuesta que será efectuada paralelamente a la encuesta anual del Índice Corporativo de Igualdad (CEI, por sus siglas en inglés) de HRC y dará a conocer los resultados durante el otoño de 2017. En el próximo reporte se evaluará a las empresas y multinacionales sobre tres pilares fundamentales de la inclusión LGBT: o Adopción de políticas de no discriminación; o Creación de grupos de recursos para empleados o consejos de diversidad e inclusión; o Participación en actividades públicas para apoyar la inclusión LGBT. Los empleadores altamente calificados recibirán una designación similar a la certificación 'Best Places to Work' ofrecida a través de la CEI. 'Las empresas de todo el mundo continúan liderando la igualdad LGBT. De las compañías que toman la encuesta de Equidad MX sobre la inclusión en la Coalición de Negocios Globales de la BLC, los socios del sector privado en todo el mundo están enviando un claro mensaje de que la igualdad y la inclusión son buenas para los negocios',dijo Mary Beth Maxwell, vicepresidenta de Programas, Investigación y Capacitación de HRC. 'El contar con el apoyo de estas cinco empresas tan importantes significa para Human Rights Campaign un gran paso en concientizar a las empresas mexicanas. México es un gran aliado comercial y social para los Estados Unidos, por lo que replicar el trabajo que hemos realizado durante 15 años en EE. UU, con las empresas que han participado en el Índice Corporativo de Igualdad, significará un parteaguas en las empresas mexicanas y multinacionales que operan en este país', dijo Deena Fidas, directora del Programa de Equidad Corporativa de la Fundación Human Rights Campaign. Por su parte, Liliana Iñigo, embajadora LGBT de Citi para América Latina y directora ejecutiva de Mercadotecnia de Citibanamex, comentó: 'Citibanamex es una institución comprometida en dar lo mejor de México y lo mejor del mundo a nuestros clientes y empleados.

Participar en la certificación HRC Equidad MX demuestra la convicción que tenemos para construir el mejor ambiente laboral para la población LGBT en México y en nuestro Grupo Financiero'. Asimismo, Guillermo González Guerra, director de Recursos Humanos de Kellogg Latinoamérica, recalcó que Kellogg busca fomentar una cultura de inclusión para todos sus colaboradores y generar un ambiente de trabajo en el que las personas sean apreciadas y puedan ser auténticas. 'A través de su programa K-Pride & Allies, la compañía trabaja para convertirse en el empleador de elección de la comunidad LGBT al promover la equidad, la solidaridad y el respeto. Obtener el distintivo HRC Equidad MX, será un paso muy importante en este sentido'dijo González Guerra. Accenture, Google y Mastercard son miembros de la Coalición de Negocios Globales de HRC, una cohorte de empleadores globales públicamente comprometidos con la inclusión en todas partes donde hacen negocios. Al respecto, Jorge Torres, director de Tecnología de Accenture, comentó que su empresa es una entidad incluyente que promueve un ambiente de confianza y motiva a cada uno de sus integrantes a ser auténticos. 'Nos sentimos orgullosos de ser una firma multinacional que trabaja cada día en brindar un ambiente de trabajo equitativo, independientemente de la orientación sexual o identidad de género de las personas. Con esto, declaramos formalmente nuestro compromiso de continuar trabajando hacia la inclusión LGBT apoyados de la certificación HRC Equidad MX', comentó Torres. Delfina Grossi, gerente de Google Marketing Solutions y embajadora de Diversidad para Google México mencionó que: 'La misión de Google es organizar la información y hacerla accesible y útil para todos. En este sentido, nuestra búsqueda por la diversidad es una extensión natural de esta misión ya que buscamos aumentar el acceso a las oportunidades, derribando las barreras y empoderando a las personas a través de la tecnología'. 'Mastercard se enorgullece de participar en la Coalición de Negocios Globales de HRC y en la promoción de la cultura corporativa inclusiva y diversa con diferentes acciones que refrendan nuestro compromiso principal con nuestro capital más importante, el humano y en la comunidad en la que trabajamos', dijo Brenda Hernández, directora de Recursos Humanos de Mastercard México, Centroamérica y el Caribe, señaló: A través de su Índice Corporativo de Igualdad, la Fundación HRC ha establecido una hoja de ruta para la adopción de políticas, beneficios y prácticas inclusivas de LGBTQ entre las principales corporaciones. El año pasado, por segundo año consecutivo, HRC lanzó su CEI internacional en la Ciudad de México junto con la Embajada de los Estados Unidos en México, The Dow Chemical Company, J.P.

Google announced today that Google Photos can now suggest images that you may want to archive. The Assistant in Google Photos will pop up and show you the various images that it thinks you could archive, and you can review all of the suggestions before actually archiving them. As a reminder, you can always view the images that you’ve archived by opening the left-hand menu and tapping Archive. When you archive an image, it’s simply removed from your main library. Archive suggestions is a nice feature for Google to add to Google Photos. If you’ve got a sizable image library, you may not want to regularly scroll through it to find images that need archiving. Now you don’t have to, and instead you can let the Assistant select the images that it thinks should be stashed away.  Source:  @GooglePhotos Android iOS Apps Google Previous ArticleSamsung debuts Pirates of the Caribbean Galaxy S8 Next ArticleAT&T offering $10 DirecTV Now to Unlimited Choice customers Don't forget to VOTE!

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 239 Plus 1 on G+ 1179 Share on Facebook 437 Share on Twitter Total Shares1418 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SafetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms that: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play Store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ C64 This is an English website, so you have to talk English. I'm Dutch, so i talk (or try to talk) English too. It hasn't to be perfect, but it would be bs if I talked Dutch over here. 'Want 90 procent van de mensen hier spreken geen Nederlands' Or do you like to use translate with everything freaking post Φώτης Chill. It was literally just two words. Not that big of a deal, don't you think? AnubArack Is it that hard to write 2 words in another language then? Kevin Strident Yo no se. You try it. Φώτης Of course not. Actually this is exactly what happened :p AnubArack You and @kevinstrident:disqus are sooooo funny. Less contextually aware than a virtual assistant. d0x360 Yes exactly lol Patrick Ahles *spreekt ;) DavidEssex Yes. I have for years. Twatberry XwaitXwhatX This is an English website Which caters to android users all across the globe pcriz Show me what rule he is breaking. Please quote it for me. Otherwise have as much right to ignore him as he does to speak whatever language he wants. Geezz what a buncha cry babies xyz He is breaking the most important rule of the internet which is faasusu polo asini. pcriz I could try and translate that and feed a troll. Or I can go on living my life. I may choose the latter. C'est la vie, damn how easy (adult) was that ? d0x360 You can talk in whatever language you want. You won't get many people paying any attention to anything you say but who cares? Also...use Google to translate it. It's that button at the very bottom. Yes, exactly xyz Du-te dracului Rebel without a Clue Want 90 procent van de mensen hier spreekt ;) C64 Sorry i was stoned 🤣 Rebel without a Clue Hahaha ok dan mag het Keletor Thank you much! You are awesome, and I totally respect you for that statement and the use of the Commodore insignia. AntiCoyote Not really fair, every single Dutch person I know speaks English as well as an American :o) C64 I'm sorry that we Dutch learn English at school :p davidus The real reason behind this is that there arent many ppl to talk to in first place, if u only speak dutch. Trust me, i m from a neighbour country ;) Me Or some Bixby xyz I don't think Google can translate dipshit. Seems to be a rarely spoken language. pcriz Um okay, whatever that means. DavidEssex How about not being ignorant. xyz Ignorant? No one speaks every language in the world, dipshit. Өөрийгөө Зөндөө Go ArclightX flüggåәnkб€čhiœßølįên There! Now put that in your pipe and smoke it! C64 Don't quit your day job Narg While I prefer English, I have to say that web browsers today make it dirt simple to translate anything, why get all worked up about this? Not using the tools at hand just show ignorance and lethargy. nasznjoka umetisha mzazi asianrage Is it being Unlocked that is not allowed, or Unlocked and Rooted as well? Corbin Davenport Both. Artem can't install it on his unlocked Google Pixel XL. h4rr4r Huh? He can install it, just not from the play store. Apk mirror, soon back answer. Corbin Davenport Yes, that's what I meant.

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). Yan Minari You better tell us more about how you set up this. stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO David Gabel And you are a loud mouth keyboard warrior that loves to talk a big game, but in reality have little to no control over anything and use web forums to spout obscenities and violent threats to make yourself feel better. nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Ravonus Damitri this guy is a nut ha... I agree with you 100% bro. Ravonus um yes you can fake it... Sure you can't block the traffic... but you sure can make it seem like the traffic is coming from your phone and not being used to tether.. Which is what these apps do.. SMH lol Latheryin If that is what you wish to believe. OK. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. My1 even if you dont have any right to access netflix, the whole point of netflix and others is making it easier to use those than to do piracy but when netflix goes around branding the rooted users as pirates and blocking them, they sure arent helping their purpose. especially if netflix is (I dont have it so I didnt try) runs on VGA and DVI Screens (no HDCP) where you can just capture the stuff. I mean it's say same withz Bluray Playback on PC, in addition to needing a Bluray Drive, you need an HDCP Compliant Graphics card, bus encryption, and HDCP compliant Monitor, and not to forget You Piece of PowerDVD which you have to upgrade (aka buy again) every few years because the older versions dont get Key Updates. and then we have stuff like unskippable trailers and all the other bluntly said Bullshit when dealing with that. of course Piracy is easier, just download the file and play it on any device you want, no internet and nothing required and no problems. My1 and even if one piece of software wont run in an Admin account, with LUA even on Admin they arent having and privileges unless you kick in the UAC, and to top it, even if the app wont be running if I force it as admin, and only runs with active LUA concept, I can still run anything else as admin and screw the other software running as normal user over (cheatengine is the perfect example for this) Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. My1 well but from another side, root can also be used to just patch any holes that were there. actually happened a few times before. My1 banking apps dont have a reason for a root check if they are done properly, i.e. TANs are generated with an air-gapped extra device. TANs on the phone are in general not safe and if the TAN is able to be generated offline, someone could use an exploit to root, steal the secret for TAN generation and boom, it's over. and dont even start thinking about sms-TAN, it's even worse. also when I just want to look into what my account is doing, I am not happy when I cant do so. My Bank (Hypovereinsbank) more or less recently blocked root and well I just RootCloaked that thing into oblivion and can do my stuff. but I'll probably change anyway since they sadly have no good way of TANs (just paper-based list-TANs, SMS and app) TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? My1 well at least a rooted phone is objectively better than a non rooted one, but relatively and subjectively speaking, if a non-rooted phone is good enough for someone then let it be so. EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Thomas Gladdines That's nonsense, the recovery works fine with or without a locked bootloader. Only fastboot won't work but that's only needed when you don't have a custom recovery to flash images. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player My1 actually it depends on how the build the DRM, if it's made to be only active when you are for example streaming netflix and does nothing for local content, which for sure can be legal (e.g. ripping DVDs in finland is no problem because CSS is not considered an "effective" protection method ever since 2007) although if the DRM would be everywhere it wouldnt be funny. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. My1 debugging is a joke right? If it's not WHAT ARE THEY DOING? I mean debugging is a core part of developing and any developer probably has it active m477 I've only seen it working like that once, so it might be an isolated case. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. Actually l like bezels Why? What do you get with root? BobButtons Primarily for system level ad-blocking. None of the non-root options can even compare. I refuse to allow ads when they have the ability to fill the entire screen and vibrate the phone. Even with being able to block ads, I still purchase the ad-free option of apps I support. Matthew Wilson Updates. Security updates. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. My1 well yeah if you actually bypass the thing you are a pirate (not a thief because stealing != illegal copy) but branding people pirates and making the software refuse if something that MIGHT be used for piracy is on the device isnt not better. 天地人 Theft is when I take your bike and it's gone and you do not have a bike anymore. When I pirate, are you losing your software or your right to sell your software? Plus, if you actually developed software, I'd probably pay for it since you aren't some big corporation. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. 天地人 Of course it depends on what you're watching. The same ideology cannot be applied to everything. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. My1 well I would and I do give my money for legal media consumption when possible but when some things have region locks, meaning I cant import them or other stupid Ideas like Netflix not doing rooted devices, I certainly wouldnt like giving money for something I cant use. My1 not really. I have streamed and/or downloaded stuff in the past (coz not available here) just to buy their blurays years after when it finally came to germany Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. My1 but doesnt the actual unlock wipe everything? EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. Captain_Invisible But you don't even need to root to get blocked. Just using a custom ROM or having an unlocked bootloader triggers it.. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. My1 well knox flag is annoying but I honestly like my Galaxy Note 4 which is the last good Samsung in my opinion becase anything later either doesnt have microSD, doesnt have a swappable batter or doesnt have both (Galaxy S6 for example) but these are 2 very important things and I really like some parts of the samsung rom, although a lot of other parts (e.g. the launcher) are junk and get replaced instantly, also root makes the thing work as I want. and well many non samsung devices use the on-screen navigation bar, one thing I despise after having a horrible experience on my tablet. and (at least outside of samsung) the fiun goes on with removing the headphone jack which is something on my absolute instant KO list for phones. I dont see the point of a digital sound connection on a phone because sound itself is analog by definition and I think the DAC in a multi-hundred euro device is better than in some cheap headphones. and not to forget the features. samsung had many features WAY earlier than AOSP did, which certainly doesnt make it so much better at least from this viewpoint, although aosp is certainly getting better with every version. but even though I like my note 4 I must say that it is by no means perfect. everything is better and worse than others if you put the right requirements in. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. Richard Markert A 7" device is too small. My tablets start at 10" minimum , and go to 12" maximum. Content consumption is unpleasant on anything smaller, and I barely watch anything on a display smaller than one of my 24" computer displays. Yes, you're right almost all of them are software features, but they are locked out when you put a junkrom on there. And Samsung Pay? Well, call me when Android Pay is compatible with magstripe readers. My bank still doesn't support Android Pay that I know of, either. GearVR. How shall I put this? Computer VR is currently overpriced - unless you want to go ahead and buy me a $600 headset, a pair of controllers @ $130 each, AND you still need to buy me a $1400 PC to run VR titles at an acceptable framerate, because while my laptop can still run AAA titles at high framerates and 1080p, it can't do VR that good. My GearVR cost me $50, it's a convenience thing, every VR title is locked 60fps, the graphics are "good enough" and I can even take calls from VR with my Bluetooth headphones. I don't care about Google Voice. Or any sort of data-based calling. US data networks are still too unstable and limited. I am pretty much guaranteed to be able to make a call anywhere I can see at least the tiniest bit of 1x signal, but if the data network is gone, or you used all your gigabytes, you can't make calls anymore on your preferred number. A lot of these things you say you simply "don't need" them, and that's how I feel about root. And about pretty much everything you care about. I don't do ebooks, I don't do movies or tv, I barely play basic games. I do listen to a LOT of music though, and yes a lot of it was stolen from when I was younger and stupider and didn't understand that without compensation there will be no content. Oh, and BTW, Knox is a good thing. It's how I have system-wide ad blocking without rooting, and how I can have my Secure Folder. You seriously think Vertu phones are luxury? Classy even! Vertu are tacky, garish and gaudy. "Look at how much money I have." Nothing classy about that ugly diamond-crusted turd. Look, I really don't care what your choices are. I'm glad you have the choice to find a device that makes you happy. But you seriously need to stop acting like your choice is the only choice. It's not. And I hope to god it never will be, because at that point, Android will no longer be a platform that fits my needs and I might as well go to Apple. Because you see, what fits my needs, is a device that provides me with everything I have, out of the box, without having to modify it. Samsung does that. They give me everything I want, and nothing I don't. And when the Note 8 comes out, the S-Pen is going to blast it so far ahead that there simply won't be any other phone in the running, not even the S9. I would still have my Note 7 if they would let me. Railwayman Good that you have your Samsung. Also great that you have your 10-12 inch tablets. I assume you bring them everywhere? Very is easy more elegant than a Samsung. It doesn't mean they are the best but way better looking than a Galaxy 8, which I have been tried and I just don't see any reason to get it because of the way Samsung design things. You like to be locked down to a carrier. Google Voice work perfectly well here without any network problems. If the network coverage is so bad that modern services doesn't work I rather jump to a satellite provider if I really need the ability to call from the middle of nowhere. I wouldn't get VZW and eliminate my device choice site to them being very restrictive about what I am allowed to use. Having a carrier dependent phone number is very... 1996. I just don't accept such a limitation - especially not the thing called roaming. I just switch my SIM card to a local one and continue to receive calls as usual. The beauty of GV. If you think iOS is the way to go if Grace UX would disappear I think you should get the iPhone then. It seems like out of the box is the most important aspect. I just don't know any device that has an out of the box experience even close to my requirements. Samsung is certainly furthest way from them. I just dislike their devices because of their design, software, carrier affiliation and serious restrictions. They just feel like a budget device full of carrier advertisement and bloatware. Richard Markert I disagree with you in every possible way. Yes, I do take at least my Surface 3 almost everywhere. My Z10 LTE goes when I'll want to play games or watch Netflix on a tiny screen with crappy headphones. Vertu: You say elegant, I say gaudy, tacky, trashy and fucking ugly, like most things marketed to people with more money than God and less sense than a cricket. I don't know where you live, work, play or travel, but many times a year I'm driving in places, especially the highways, that will have no data coverage. It's that simple. All your google voice hijinks mean nothing when you have -100 dBm of 1x and the mobile data network is completely unavailable. I can still make and receive calls at that point, because Verizon, but you're shit out of luck because you only give people your GV (interface is barf, btw) number. Oh, and for the record, I just flashed the US Unlocked FW to my S8, so now I have no Verizon junkware or restrictions, like my S7e before it. And yes, at this point in my life, I'm sick and tired of having to do the software developers' job for them. When I was younger I found all that rom cooking, kernel coding, smali editing, adb pushing, su manipulating stuff fun and exciting, but now all I want is a phone with the features that I want that Just Works OOB. I also feel the way you do about stock android. It's design, included software, limitations and style are not appealing. And every phone is "a carrier advertisement", and has always been that way. Until the S8, every phone came with a carrier logo if you bought from a carrier. I get what you want from a phone, I really do. You want a basic device with no features that you can add onto to do what you want. But man, you gotta stop acting like you're the Westboro Baptist Church and Samsung is the homosexual community. Railwayman Samsung is not the homosexual community, right. They are the mainstream community where everyone eat at McDonald's.:) The homosexual community is more about being different rather than following the mainstream, i.e. the opposite of Samsung (it is hard to be more Average Joe adjusted than they are...). The day I really want coverage in "every possible place" is the day I get myself a satellite phone, especially if I am to drive in remote land where I can't rely on decent carrier coverage. Your attempts to put down Google Voice is amusing. Verizon are going to shut down their CDMA network and HTC U11 is already out, with support for their LTE but not the old fashioned thing also known as 1X.:) It is also amusing that you argue that hard against vanilla Android. Did you ever consider iOS or Windows Phone? If I would dislike vanilla that much, down to a dislike for Material Design I would switch platform immediately. If I don't like the system the way its creator intended it then perhaps it isn't for me and I switch. Relying on some third party OEM to "modify it to my liking" is a bit naive. A Samsung has something that is an "Android based OS" very much like Nokia X/XL had the Android based "Nokia Software Platform". I also notice your misconception about how other devices work. My device runs perfectly well. It just... works. It has a lot of features not present on a Samsung (yes, I have used the S 8/Plus), consume 0.1% per hour in standby, provide me 12-13 hours SOT and simply do more things than any "out-of-the-box Samsung" does and do them well. Samsung make pretty simple devices, with ill designed software full of bloatware and "added value" applications and services reducing performance and increase power consumption. I would say bling. Then we have other devices offering more useful features, higher performance, lower power consumption, more elegant design and so on. What they don't offer is the marketing known as Samsung. It's a good thing, actually - it leads to better value for money. BTW, Google Voice is simply a vastly superior service compared to VZW. You can start travel (out of the US) or trying to get your texts synced into your Google account with your carrier based service... Bragging about 1X is like bragging about EDGE coverage in... 2017. "My carrier is better than yours because I have 1X service on the soon-to-be-gone CDMA network on my Samsung and it makes it so much better than using modern IP based services! I am truly modern with my Samsung! My phone number is also controlled by my carrier and I must pay roaming when I travel, which is great - more money to Verizon! Much, much better than using GV on a data plan!" The day I need "coverage out in the nowhere land" I either get the satellite phone or some burner for that very purpose (it's a case of simply routing the GV calls to that thing). I know since before that modern communication services are a bit alien to proud owners of carrier branded Samsung devices. It is hard to think outside the box - much easier to just use Samsung with branding and everything.:) Good luck with your Samsung. Consider an iPhone next time. Apple has a new one coming and it can give you some taste of what being unlocked means (buy it from Apple Store). I think it can be enlightening, especially if you try the Genius Bar as well (i.e. better service than Samsung could ever offer through the carriers). Richard Markert I get it, you're a Google and Stock Android zealot. I read maybe 3 words of your damn novel. I do want you to answer this question without a dissertation And 500 page thesis: what are you going to do when you're in the middle of nowhere in a dead sport for data and your car breaks down? derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? Mariano Moreira I am using Factory Images because I can choose to only use Bootslot B this way. Bootslot A on this current Pixel and the 3 before it has the non-working mic and no working headphone jack issue. I hear the issue is resolved on newer handsets, but have not RMA'd this device yet. I need the microphone and headphone jack, so letting the phone do an OTA and move me to Bootslot A is no-go. *I have N2G47O installed on both Bootslot A and Bootslot B, currently. Only Bootslot A has the audio issue even thought the exact same Factory Image is installed. saf1927 Oh, wasn't aware of that. Did it affect all the old devices? I got mine at launch but haven't experienced the issues you describe. Is there a way to reproduce them? I normally either take the OTA or flash the OTA images via fastboot. Mariano Moreira Allegedly only 1% of devices (I just have bad luck, I suppose.) https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsIW_gxTpXX3s/?hl=by I have posts around late November- early December on in that thread about mic/headphone jack issue My 1st device was fine until after the 2nd Update, but I had not diagnosed Bootslot A/B discrepancy. Wasn't until after 2nd Device (1st Replacement) that I have been able to always get Bootslot A to have faulty mic on my replacement devices. My Cousin and his girlfriend both have Pixel XLs. He had a dead Mic out of the box but currently neither his nor his Girlfriend's Pixel XL has mic issue. Even with forcing Bootslot A for a month of testing. I most likely have another faulty device, just this is my 4th Pixel from Google and everything is fine except Bootslot A. jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... My1 yeah, I do root for theming and stuff, but srsly they literally are throwing oil in the Piracy and DRM discussions with this. Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix. Lawstorant Magisk stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy Linus Monie If you are this afraid of someone potentially fiddling around with your code, the problem is not the 'fiddler', it is your code. Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... My1 I think their problem is rather that rooted users *might* be able to capture the decrypted stream using root or whatever and they are afraid of that. although on PC you have admin permissions and netflix has no problems iirc. Linus Monie Yeah, exactly, its not like people will prefer to pirate the stream on their phone (at least I wouldn't...), so that was my first thought of why they made this change. Now that I think about it though, its probably not so much of a Netflix decision as it is a licensing issue with one of their "film sources". (can't think of a better word for it rn..) Licensing issues are a bitch when you need to adapt to as many as Netflix has... My1 yeah true. pirating on phone makes (quoting austin from game theory) NO. GOD. DAMN. SENSE. I mean I dunno whether you can automate that so good and/or get it fast enough, especially with the relatively low storage, no LAN capability and so on. BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. My1 I have never tried but if netflix can run over a non-HDCP connection like DVI or VGA, there's literally no reason to use a phone for piracy. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. My1 or use DVI if possible, even better. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have?

Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk. While some say it's hit and miss with Pokemon GO (idk, I don't play it) it's never not worked for me with Snapchat/Android Pay/Mario Run. cliff_dangers Why does everyone freak out about a rooted phone but my PC which is wide open is not a problem? What makes smartphones so special? Doro Manekia ΝετΦλξ Ανάθεμα σου.Χα χα χα Το Μαααακα. Bewear I am not that upset because I rarely use Netflix on my mobile, I am upset because this kind of blocking will become a trend. BoFiS ugh, fuck you, Netflix, I pay for your serve, LET ME USE IT ON MY PHONE A.M There are some many ways around that LAME NETFLIX - Showbox Kodi Firestick with Kodi I can't see the point of Netflix when we have so MANY better apps out there that kill Netflix ErectBipedal That'll teach them filthy pirates for trying to pay us money!.... wait.... -Netflix probably Zxyon Rhysivz What could users with unlocked/rooted phones do with the Netflix app that other users can't? Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it? I mean really, if you are rooting your phone you most likely will find a workaround. Luxferro Not yet, but you can be sure the app will stop working in the future. Znuff The download feature is not working for me anymore. And the 5.x app is not working at all, just says I need to install the 4.x one (redirects me to the download page) Tim Get Roku tv or a fire stick cause no issues there and it isn't through Google then Biga173rd People still use Netflix? mlauzon And this is exactly how you piss off your end users! Doug Rogers I guess I'll have to unroot - whoops, Android 4.2 Awesome. Luxferro Don't forget to leave your 1 star review. Links to both apps (Android TV and the normal Android app) https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient&hl=en&rdid=com.netflix.mediaclient https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.ninja&rdid=com.netflix.ninja Yoda’s Spirit Seems they keep cracking down on anything Open internet related! The only way I can watch overseas now is using Mediahint.com - nothing else works. Luxferro Just use usenet. They are forcing their legit customers to piracy... DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money... Ubelsteiner And thus, Plex and Kodi become even more popular, as Netflix drives a nail into it's own coffin. Znuff http://i.imgur.com/LG3dXc4.jpg http://i.imgur.com/eNeuPCD.jpg Can not use the latest version on my device, it sends me to download the 4.x version. When I try that, the latest 4.x version has Downloads disabled for me (it used to work on this device). US Patriot No worries. I can live without Netflix, but I will NOT live without full control of my devices and data. Ricardo A. Fragoso For those who want root at all cost there's still a chance to get movies with ChromeCast Support... Google "TerrariumTV". :D You are welcome. :D Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 Mobile devices are now a vice.The rules,whether stringent or lenient,if there's demand,the market will fill the demand.Plain and simple.So to Mr.Gable,your wrong buttercup. Nick Coad I can guarantee you that Netflix doesn't make these choices willingly. The production companies they purchase shows off are notoriously backward when it comes to technology and unfortunately Netflix relies on them to survive. Kevin Davis So I can't update my Netflix app on my unaltered Google Store Pixel XL. FUCK YOU NETFLIX, and goodbye, you SONS OF BITCHES. Signed, a former longtime top tier subscriber, until, as of now. Once again, so there is no doubt: FUCK YOU NETFLIX, and goodbye. Sent from my Google Store Pixel XL. theinternetmakesyoustupid who the hell watches netflix on their phone.. johnforamerica Chromecast? Sledge If you have the app installed you can use the in app option to call netflix over wifi. Do this. Be heard. Don't let them continue to push back against the right to tinker. McHenryGames Main reason to root is XPosed. Screw Netflix and screw Google. Brian Both my phone and tablet are as they left they left the factory. Both are blocked form the new update, neither is rooted. Looked like they are trying to promote rival services as it is unacceptable to block legitimate users on a paying service. ED-Zが現れた! Well... Time to change my rate from 5 to 1... Thomas That's a surprising backward move from Netflix, a company that I admire and follow, not just as customer but as an engineer. I wonder if, adding up with their experimental price hike, someone with the wrong ideas got recently hired...

Speaker What Australian Scientists Say About Trump's Paris Climate Deal Decision What To Expect From Apple WWDC 2017: iOS, Siri Speaker And MacBooks Michael Nunez Jun 3, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple feature ios 11 macbook macbook air macos siri video feature wwdc wwdc 2017 Share On Tuesday, Apple's annual developer conference, WWDC, kicks off, and that means we will soon learn more about the company's newest and most exciting products. This year, the event runs from June 5 to June 9 (June 6 to June 10 in Australia) and is expected to serve as the launching point for major updates to iOS and macOS, as well as some new hardware. Image: Apple This will be the first time in roughly 15 years that Apple will not be hosting the event at the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco. Instead, the event will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. We'll be on the ground at the conference, so be sure to check back for our coverage beginning Tuesday morning. There's plenty to be excited about this year, so let's dive right in. A new iPad Pro Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz WWDC is typically centred around software like iOS and macOS, but this year we're expecting some hardware too. The extremely credible KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says there's a good chance Apple will announce a new iPad Pro at this year's conference. The new iPad Pro is rumoured to have a 10.5-inch screen that will fit comfortably between the existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. It will also reportedly feature a new design with slimmer bezels. There's no indication of exactly how much the new device will cost — but there's a very good chance it will be priced similarly to existing models (starting at about $850). Siri speaker Image: Apple The new iPad Pro isn't the only piece of hardware expected to debut at the conference. Kuo also predicts that Apple is planning to launch a smart speaker to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. In a research note viewed by MacRumors, Kuo reportedly said there is "over [a] 50 per cent chance" that Apple will announce its new smart home speaker and begin selling them later in the year. Kuo said the speaker will likely produce excellent sound quality and will positioned for a higher end market (that is, it will be more expensive) than the Amazon Echo. Adding to swirling rumours, the extremely credible Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman reported this week that Apple "started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker". Gurman reports that the speaker will differ from the Amazon Echo and Google home by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration into Apple products. The speaker will essentially serve as a hub to automate smart home devices through Apple's (currently underdeveloped) HomeKit platform. It will also help lock customers into Apple's walled garden as people begin to add more automation to their homes and subscribe to services like Apple Music. Gurman also reports that the speaker will have advanced acoustics that give it an edge over competing products such as the Echo and Google Home, and that Apple considered adding virtual surround sound technology similar to Sonos Trueplay. It will also have comparable hardware to the Sonos Play:5 according to Kuo's research note, which says the speaker will have one subwoofer, seven tweeters, and computing power similar to the iPhone 6/6S. By comparison, as Mac Observer points out, the Echo only has one woofer and one tweeter. The Sonos Play:5 only has three woofers and three tweeters. In short, the soon-to-be-announced Siri speaker sounds much more powerful than Google Home or Amazon Echo. New MacBook and MacBook Pros Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz It looks all-but-certain that we'll be getting a new MacBook lineup at the conference. French website Consomac is reporting that it found a Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission database that points to at least five new models running macOS Sierra launching soon. In addition to the filing, Bloomberg reports Apple will be releasing a new MacBook lineup to stave off competition from Microsoft's striking new Surface Laptop. The new MacBook Pro will get a bump to the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors, giving it a significant hardware boost. One of the more remarkable rumours is that Apple could revive the 12-inch and 13-inch MacBook Airs by giving them a nice hardware bump, according to Bloomberg. Analysts aren't expecting any major design changes to either the MacBook or MacBook Pro, but say the new MacBook Air could have a new look. John Gruber reported in April that Apple is working hard on a "completely rethought" Mac Pro with a modular design. The new design is supposed to accommodate high-end CPUs and GPUs, and make it easier for people to update the computer with new components on a regular basis. The company is also working on pro displays to ship with the new desktops. Unfortunately, Gruber reports that the next-gen Mac Pros "will not ship this year", meaning they likely will not make an appearance at WWDC. A first look at iOS 11 Image: Gizmodo Don't get your hopes up for new iPhone models. They probably aren't coming until later this year. What you can expect at WWDC, though, is a big focus on Apple's new mobile operating system, iOS 11. We don't know much about the OS ahead of the show, but we're expecting a bunch of updates that focus on artificial intelligence. A sketchy rumour from Israeli publication the Verifier suggests that Siri will add contextual learning and better integration into Apple services like iMessage and iCloud. Other updates to the operating system, according to 9to5Mac, could include features like group FaceTime, meaning that you'll be able to video conference multiple people from your phone. There's also a rumour that iMessage will add multi-person calls, making it easier to have up to five people join a single call. The most dramatic changes will be specifically tailored to the iPad. 9to5Mac reports that things such as multi-user login are to be added to the operating system, while other blogs like MacRumors suggest Apple is working on expanded Apple Pencil support for the iPad Pro. Updates to macOS, WatchOS and tvOS Last year, Apple decided to drop the "X" from its desktop operating system's name, instead calling it simply macOS. As part of the update, Apple started integrating even more iOS features into the desktop with things such as Siri for Mac and Apple Pay for the web. This year, we're expecting to see the second iteration of macOS (10.13), but there aren't any hard details about what exactly. We should also see updates to other operating systems including WatchOS for the Apple Watch and tvOS for the Apple TV, according to the Telegraph. This essentially means that every operating system in the Apple ecosystem will receive a significant update, and that seems like a reasonable expectation considering the event is specifically tailored to get developers excited about building apps for Apple products. As always, we'll be covering the conference as news breaks, so be sure to check back here June 6 to June 10 for more info about the latest updates.

Here's what they had to say. NYPD Fails To Convince Court Its Deafening Sound Cannon Is Just A 'Communication Tool' Sidney Fussell 03 Jun 2017 1:00 PM On Wednesday, a US federal judge ruled that the sound emitted from the NYPD's Long Range Acoustic Devices -- portable sound cannons that blast noise -- could be considered a use of force, contrary to the police department's claims. The LRAD can blast sound as loudly as 136 decibels. That's louder than a jackhammer or a jet engine and above the 120 db threshold for immediate human hearing loss. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

It seems HTC agreed, because its new flagship, the HTC U11, is here and it's better in almost every way. Priced at $649, the HTC U11 features a big, bright, 5.5-inch screen; markedly faster performance; and a camera that rivals the best from Samsung and Apple, all while sporting a gorgeous, gem-like design. But the highlights don't stop there, because the U11 packs a total of four microphones, two voice assistants (with a third on the way) and built-in pressure sensors that let you open apps by squeezing the sides of the phone. After HTC produced a string of middling devices, the U11 is exactly what the company needed to remind people that it's still alive.  Availability In stores, the U11 is exclusive to Sprint. However, if you buy online, you can get this phone unlocked. There are carrier-specific versions of the U11 for all the big providers on Amazon or directly from HTC.com. Design: A symphony in glass There's no shortage of glass-backed phones nowadays, but I defy you to you find one (aside from the U Ultra) that looks like the U11. For the U11's back, HTC started with a single flat sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 and squashed it into progressively curvier molds to form a smooth, rounded back that looks more like sci-fi jewel scarab than a piece of consumer tech.  Below the display, you get a combo fingerprint sensor that also doubles as a capacitive-touch home button, along with two more touch buttons on either side, for Back and Recent Apps. The lock button on the right side sports a jagged texture, so you can recognize it by feel, while the smooth volume rocker sits above that. The U11's top edge features a removable SIM tray with space for a microSD card when you want to add some additional capacity to the U11's built-in 64GB of storage. Some folks may take issue with the U11's sizable bezels on top and bottom now that we live in an age of super-skinny smartphone designs. But for me, the bigger issue is that the bezels on top and bottom are different widths. Had they been the same, the phone would look a little more balanced and a bit less bulky, though with its 5.5-inch display and 16:9 aspect ratio, the U11 was never going to be a truly compact device.  Measuring 6.06 x 2.99 x 0.31-inches and weighing 5.96 ounces, the HTC U11 is practically the same size as the Google Pixel XL (6.09 x 2.98 x 0.33 inches and 5.93 ounces). However, compare the U11 to the Galaxy S8 (5.86 x 2.68 x 0.31 inches and 5.47 ounces), and Samsung's flagship feels significantly smaller and sleeker. That's despite the S8 having a total screen area that's actually slightly larger, thanks to its 18.5:9 aspect-ratio display. A simple squeeze of the U11's sides can open an app or even take a picture. Like any good flagship smartphone in 2017, the U11 boasts IP67 water resistance, so you won't have to worry about any spills or dips in the sink trashing your device.  Edge Sense: Do we really need a squeezable phone? Moto has its Moto Actions gesture commands, and Huawei has its Knuckle Sense shortcuts. But with Edge Sense, HTC might have the weirdest motion controls of them all. You don't make movements with your hands or draw letters on the screen; instead, the U11 features pressure sensors built into the sides of the phone, so a simple squeeze can open an app or even take a picture. By default, Edge Sense is set to open the camera when you squeeze the phone, but you can reprogram the feature to open pretty much any app on the device or toggle functions like the flashlight or Wi-Fi. Depending on what you choose, Edge Sense even has a bit of contextual smarts, letting you perform different tasks with the same simple action. For instance, you can open the camera on the first squeeze and then snap a pic on the second. Edge Sense's advanced settings will also let you add a second function for when you squeeze and hold the phone. The 5.5-inch QHD display delivers on the three most important qualities of a good screen: brightness, color and accuracy. The best use of Edge Sense is probably for taking a selfie, since your hands will likely be in the correct position to give the phone a little hand hug. However, I've found that even when Edge Sense's was set to its most sensitive pressure setting, trying to squeeze the phone while posing for a shot caused the device to shake more than if I had just tapped on the screen. In fact, the action of squeezing the U11 makes holding the phone that much trickier. While it didn't happen to me, because I went out of my way to be super careful, I wouldn't be surprised to hear about people dropping the U11 while trying to squeeze it.  MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market Now Display: Big and bright The 5.5-inch QHD display on the HTC U11 keeps things simple and delivers on the three most important qualities of a good screen: brightness, color and accuracy. You don't get pure blacks like you would on a phone with an OLED display (such as the Pixel or Galaxy S8), but the U11 still offers pretty solid contrast. Initially, the U11 had a somewhat cool color casting that accentuated blues and downplayed warmer tones, but a quick trip to the phone's color-temperature setting makes it easy to adjust the screen however you want. In practically no time, I had the crimson and neon green blaster bolts shooting out from the X-wings and TIE fighters in The Last Jedi trailer looking exactly how I wanted. That's a nice bit of customizability that not every phone offers.  With the adaptive brightness on, we got the HTC U11 to hit a peak output of 512 nits. That puts it a fair bit ahead the Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel XL, which hit 437 nits and 396 nits, respectively. With its stereo BoomSound speakers and noise-cancelling headphones, the HTC U11 offers the best overall listening experience of any phone on the market. The U11 also earned some of the highest marks for color accuracy we've seen in recent history, as it notched a Delta-E rating of 0.34 (numbers closer to zero are better). The S8 was equally as good, with a rating of 0.36, while the Pixel was pretty far off, at 5.88.  As for color range, the U11's LCD display didn't fare quite as well as some of its AMOLED-equipped competition. Still, with a gamut that covered 166 percent of the sRGB spectrum, the U11 wasn't that far off the respective 183 percent and 191 percent tallies of the Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel XL. Audio: Punchy stereo speakers, but no headphone jack With its stereo BoomSound speakers and included noise-cancelling headphones, the HTC U11 offers the best overall listening experience of any phone on the market. But there's one big downer: Like other recent HTC phones, the U11 lacks a headphone jack.  The U11's BoomSound setup uses the bottom-firing speaker in tandem with the earpiece to put out a truly impressive amount of sound. The feature makes phones with single-speaker setups, like the Galaxy S8, sound embarrassingly bad, and when you put the U11 up against phones, like the iPhone 7, with similar two-speaker arrangements, the U11 stills wins on both volume and sound quality. MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked Smartphones When you want to listen to things a bit more privately, HTC includes a pair of special USB-C earbuds that automatically create a personalized audio profile specifically tuned for your ears. On top of that, HTC uses the tiny mics built into the earbuds to provide true noise cancellation, which should be a big boon to anyone listening to music on a plane or train. I also appreciate how HTC includes three different size tips for its earbuds to help ensure a better fit.  The U11's 12-megapixel rear camera produced stunning shots, putting HTC on an equal footing with camera phones from Apple, Google and Samsung. But there's a downside: Even though HTC has thoughtfully included a dongle so you can still use your old-school headphones, the adaptive audio and noise-cancelling tech needs both the USB-C audio processing and HTC's custom earbuds to function. In other words, those special features won't work on third-party headphones. Cameras: New heights for HTC It seems like HTC has been promising big things from its Ultrapixel cameras forever, and on the U11, the company has really delivered. The U11's 12-megapixel rear camera produced stunning shots, putting HTC on an equal footing with phone cameras from Apple, Google and Samsung. I especially liked some of the low-light shots I got, which looked noticeably brighter and less grainy compared to images from the S8.  During the daytime, the U11 also wowed, offering a more restrained counterpoint to the super-rich and saturated shots captured by the Galaxy S8. On the front, though, the U11's 16-MP selfie cam was less compelling than I hoped. The Flower Shot A picture of a flower can tell you a lot of things about a camera, and while neither the Galaxy S8 nor the U11 nailed it 100 percent, HTC's phone still impressed. This comparison exposes the S8's tendency to oversaturate colors, which resulted in unnaturally vivid magenta petals instead of the softer pink tones you see from the U11. The S8's picture is just a tad sharper, though a few areas could be called oversharp. The Food Shot In the contest to see which phone shoots a better burger, the U11 came out on top. It's close, but the U11's pic looks warmer; features more-accurate colors; offers better details in the bun, bacon and onion rings; and simply made the sandwich look more delicious. In fact, when I asked my co-workers to pick which phone's photo they prefered, every single person chose the U11's pic. The Outdoors Shot In the last of the daylight comparisons, the S8 hit back hard with a shot that beat the U11's pic in almost every aspect: color, sharpness, detail, you name it. The S8's pic even did a better job of preserving the baby blue sky in the background. The Low-Light Close-Up Shot At night, when I took a minute to snap my growing family of plushies, the U11 showed some serious low-light skills, producing a better-exposed, less grainy picture than the Galaxy S8 did. Meanwhile, the S8's shot looked overly yellow, and without the S8's pic as a comparison, you might not even know this was a low-light shot at all. MORE: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Camera Shootout: Samsung Has the Edge The Outdoors Low-Light Shot In even less light, the U11 once again wowed, with a nighttime shot that's noticeably brighter and less noisy than the S8's photo. In the S8's image, you lose a lot of detail in the darker sections in the foreground, and the overly yellow white balance give the plants a sickly, unpleasant appearance.   In general, I found that the U11 outperforms the S8 is many low-light scenarios, though results can vary. When I walked just a bit farther and took a shot of a nearby pool, the S8's shot was clearly superior, as the U11's photo showed worse exposure and white balance. Selfies With a 16-MP front cam that captures double the resolution of the Galaxy S8, you might expect the U11 to come out firmly ahead. However, that wasn't the case. Quite often, the S8's front camera produced sharper, more-detailed photos than the U11 did. Yes, the background in the U11's pic is better-exposed, but if you look at things like my hair or shirt, it's clear how much better the S8's pic is. Performance: As fast as it gets When you combine Qualcomm's powerful Snapdragon 835 processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, you get some of the best performance on a smartphone available right now. On Geekbench 4, which measures overall system performance, the U11 posted a score of 6,493; that's slightly higher than what we got from the Samsung Galaxy S8 (6,124). Meanwhile, Google's Pixel XL and its Snapdragon 821 processor performed 35 percent worse, with a score of 4,146.  It was the same story for web performance, where the U11 scored 70.52 on the JetStream 1.1 JavaScript test. The Galaxy S8 was only slightly behind, with a score of 67.5, while the Google Pixel XL was pretty far back, with a score of 55.93. MORE: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7: Which Phone Is Really the Fastest? The U11's graphics performance was also quite impressive. On 3DMark's IceStorm Unlimited test, the U11 hit 40,946, versus 35,903 for the Galaxy S8, and just 28,182 for the Pixel XL.  Software: Two digital assistants with one more on the way HTC has maintained a pretty light touch on Android 7.1, so that its Sense UI will look instantly familiar to anyone with even the slightest knowledge of Google's mobile OS. Some small differences include the BlinkFeed news app that appears when you swipe right from the home screen; that's normally where Google Now cards live. The HTC U11 also features a more traditional icon for the app drawer instead of the minimalist app launcher you'd get on a Pixel. The one big addition HTC tacks on is its Sense Companion, which is another digital assistant that works alongside the built-in Google Assistant. The two assistants have a lot of overlapping features, including the ability to set reminders or notify you when you're near a place of interest, but Google's assistant still has the clear lead in search and answering questions.  The Sense Companion is actually more like a digital secretary, as it may remind you to recharge your phone in the afternoon so you won't run low while attending meetings at night. Or it may tell you that you need to step up your activity, after noticing a lower-than-normal step count earlier in the day. In practice, I found that just letting the Sense Companion do its thing was a helpful but not essential tool for better personal and device management. But when I had a question I needed answering, Google is still the one I asked for by name.  Coming sometime this summer (think early July), Alexa will also make an appearance on the U11. Unlike with half-baked attempts to incorporate Amazon's voice assistant into other phones, which require you to physically open an app before voicing your request, using Alexa on the U11 should be exactly the same as talking to an Amazon Echo or Dot. However, since Alexa wasn't available on our review unit, we're not sure how the assistant will perform. Battery Life: Pretty good but not great The U11 has more than enough battery life to last a full workday. However, as battery life on smartphones continues to improve across the board, the U11's longevity doesn't really stand out.  On the Tom's Guide Battery Test (continuous web surfing using Sprint 4G LTE), the U11 lasted 9 hours and 38 minutes. That's just marginally better than the 9:32 smartphone average and an hour to an hour-and-a-half less than the times for competing flagships, such as the Galaxy S8 (10:39) and the Google Pixel XL (11:11). MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery Life When it comes time to recharge the phone, the U11 features Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0, which can recharge the phone to over 50 percent in 30 minutes. Strangely though, the U11 doesn't have support for Quick Charge 4.0, even though all Snapdragon 835 devices should have support for Qualcomm's newer charging standard. Unfortunately, for those who don't want to deal with wires, the U11, does not support wireless charging.  Bottom Line HTC can keep its Sense Companion and its squeezable Edge Sense controls. Those features work as advertised, but I don't need 'em. The things that really makes the U11 stand out are its unique jewel-like design, thumping BoomSound speakers, superb performance and a rear camera that can keep pace with the best from Apple, Google and Samsung. However, even though the Galaxy S8 costs $100 more, I still have to give a slight edge to that phone, due to its more one-hand-friendly design, better display and longer battery life. The S8's headphone jack is nice, too. Still, it's a close call, made even closer by features like the U11's noise-cancelling earbuds and forthcoming Alexa integration, which could both convince you to side with the U11. And if they did, you'd be making a solid choice, because the U11 is the best phone HTC has made in the last five years. Photo credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide. Comparisons: Sam Rutherford/Tom's Guide. 8/10 Quick Take The U11 is the best phone HTC's offered in years, and the device's camera matches up nicely with that of the more expensive Galaxy S8. Still, Samsung's phone lasts longer on a charge and offers both a better design and display. $649.00 Amazon About the author Sam Rutherford @samrutherford Sam Rutherford is a senior product reviews analyst at Tom's Guide who covers smartphones, car tech and cameras.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd... Mainly I get approximately 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours constantly.And magnificent factor with this job is the fact that you can supervise time when you do the job and for just how long as you wish for and you attain a check week by week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now needa I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments.

Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable. Lars Jeppesen Not available in my countries... Gen. Chang The point is to force the ad industry and websites to change the way they operate. Not reward them for more bad behavior. If it was not for the privacy intrusive models they use, there would not be as big a problem.

According to Google, about 22% of gaming developers are women. This is why Google has teamed up with the Wonder Woman movie to launch a new coding project that is based around the movie as part of Google’s Made with Code initiative. This particular project will see kids code three unique scenes from the movie using introductory coding principles that will help Wonder Woman navigate obstacles and to reach her goal. According to Google, “Made with Code, Google’s initiative to champion the next generation of female leaders and inspire them to see coding as a way to pursue their dreams, is releasing a new interactive coding project for wonder women everywhere to add coding to their superpower toolkit.” It looks like a pretty fun project and while it is aimed at girls, we don’t see why the boys can’t join in on the fun as well. For those who are interested in checking it out, head on over to Made with Code’s website for the details. Filed in General. Read more about education, Google and Movies.

After President Donald Trump mistyped (then deleted) a tweet, some hurried to ascribe meanings to the mistyped word "covfefe." 3K CLAIM "Covfefe" means something, anything. FALSE RATING FALSE ORIGIN On 31 May 2017 President Trump send a late-night tweet that began with a complaint about his press coverage and ended with the non-word “covfefe,” baffling many. While “covfefe” jokes proliferated, some began speculating that Trump had not accidentally flubbed the word “coverage,” but instead had been speaking either in code or Arabic.  The #covfefe plot thickens: according to Google Translate, “Cov fe’fe” means سوف فقف “I will stand up” in Arabic. https://t.co/IhIUqQkc4u — Covfefe David Miles (@chrisdavidmiles) June 1, 2017 However, a little work with Google Translate shows that “covfefe” means nothing at all in Arabic. Only by turning it into two words and adding an apostrophe — cov fe’fe — one can create a phrase that Google Translate says means “I will stand up.”  That’s a bit of a stretch. On 2 June, The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee tweeted:  We have received many inquiries over the past few days. We can unequivocally say #covfefe is NOT an Arabic word. https://t.co/4xwJV7IIkP — ADC National (@adctweets) June 2, 2017 Variations: A separate rumor, this one published by The Marshall Report, held: Covfefe’ (pronounced “cuv – fee- fae”) is an Antediluvian term for “In the end we win.” It was commonly used by the sons of Adam to rail against the evil actions of the fallen who had led man astray. The term gained popularity prior to the great deluge and was rarely used after the flood subsided. It regained favor around the time Nimrod was building his tower, after which it was entirely lost in translation at Babel. The term “antediluvian” does not refer to a language, but a Biblical time period before the Flood. Needless to say, the writer, Dianne Marshall offered no proof for her claim. (The Marshall Report frequently uses “satirical” and fake articles as the bases for its posts.) Another rumor, posted to Facebook by one commenter and printed by the web site Godlike Productions held that word came from a Yiddish folktale about a rare butterfly:  A few people have asked me about President’s Trump’s tweet in which he used the word “covfefe.” Most people think he meant to write “coverage” and they have had quite a bit of fun with it, but actually it is a real word of Yiddish origin, meaning “a futile search” or “a pointless and false quest.” It was originally transliterated from the Hebrew as “kabfefe,” whose etymology is “kab”—relating to the mystical Qabalah—and “fefe,” which is a word for “butterfly.” What Trump was actually saying in Yiddish tweet-speak was, “We are doing great things despite the press’s negative and pointless search, aka fake news.” For those who are interested, the idea of “covfefe” comes from an old Yiddish tale about a foolish Sephardi rabbi who believed he was called to find and destroy the mythical and rare butterfly known as Benshariza, or “Lucifer butterfly”—a name that comes from “Helel ben Shahar,” meaning “shining star” (see Isaiah 14:12; also see Ephesians 2:2, where Satan is called the “prince of the power of the air”). The rabbi claimed that the Benshariza was recognizable by a unique and disturbing pattern on its huge wings, which looked like the moon and star symbol of the god Ba’al-Hadad. He was convinced that this ominous creature housed “the spirit of Satan” and that if he could destroy it, he would free the world of evil. We contacted Ben Kaplan, the Education Administrator at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, who told us by email, after consulting with colleagues:  The Yiddish language and literature scholars at the YIVO Institute confirm that “covfefe” is not a Yiddish word.  (However, an anonymous source warns against whispering it three times in the dark, in a mirror, during a full moon.) Isaac L. Bleaman, a PhD candidate and Yiddish scholar at New York University’s Linguistics Department added:  It is obviously a typo for “coverage.” I see no clear (or even unclear) connection to Yiddish. As for the legend cited, if you Google the string “kabfefe” there are only 45 results and all are either typos, or related to the covfefe incident. Nothing found in Google Books. So chances are it was made up. The only Yiddish word “covfefe” brings to mind is kopveytik ‘headache,’ but that would not make sense in the context of the tweet, and it is not an especially common borrowing into Jewish English. So Trump probably has never heard the word, and certainly wouldn’t use it in his English. We know from Trump’s use of “schlonged” in 2015 (a verb that he took from the Jewish English word for ‘penis’ that ultimately derives from the Yiddish noun shlang ‘snake’) that his use of Yiddish borrowings can be rather idiosyncratic. But I don’t think this is one of those Yiddishisms.  I’d sooner look for a Russian connection. “Covfefe” is not a word, nor is it a Nazi, Israeli, or any other type of acronym. It has no meaning. The President clearly mistyped a tweet, which he later deleted. Updated 2 June 2017 to include Yiddish variation.

Digital Trends Home > Home > Here's how to set up Alexa Calling and… Here's how to set up Alexa Calling and Messaging By Kyle Wiggers — Updated June 3, 2017 12:24 am Subscribe Share Amazon Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Google may have upstaged Amazon with the introduction of voice calling for Google Home, but the Echo isn’t without messaging tricks of its own. Alexa Calling & Messaging, which debuted earlier this year, lets you exchange memos between any two Echo devices, including the original Echo, Dot, and Tap. It works regardless of the distance between them — Amazon delivers messages between speakers on opposing continents the same way it delivers them to devices on the same Wi-Fi network. Better yet, they’re always free. Alexa’s calling features include Skype-like conferencing and automatic transcription and recording, and message recipients get the speech-to-text message readouts via the Alexa app for iOS and Android devices. However, some of these features take some time to get the hang of. Here’s everything you need to know to get started with Alexa Calling & Messaging. How to enable Calling & Messaging Amazon Calling & Messaging has a few prerequisites. First, you’ll need an Amazon Echo speaker — the original Echo or the Dot — along with an iOS device (running version 9.0 or higher) or an Android device (running Android 5.0 or higher). You’ll also need a valid phone number. Once you’ve checked those boxes, though, it’s relatively smooth sailing. If you haven’t already, download the Alexa app for iOS or Android. If you’re setting up an Echo speaker for the first time, follow the app’s step-by-step instructions to connect your Echo speaker to your Wi-Fi network, update its firmware, and enable features like Bluetooth. After that’s taken care of, you can get started with Alexa Calling: Open the Alexa app, and tap the speech bubble icon at the bottom of the screen. Here, you’ll see a welcome screen. Tap the Get Started button. Select your name from the list on the following screen. Then, hit the Continue button. You’ll be asked to grant Alexa permission to access your phone’s contacts. Tap Allow to continue. The Alexa app will prompt you to verify your phone number. Enter it, and then wait for the verification code. Paste the code in the corresponding text field and hit the Continue button. That’s it! You’ve successfully set up Alexa Calling & Messaging. How to send a voice message from the Alexa app Enabling calls and messages on your Echo devices is half the battle. Now, you have to learn how to use them. You can’t call just anyone. Unlike voice calls with Google Home, which can reach any landline or mobile phone, Alexa Calling & Messaging only works with other Amazon speakers. In addition, Echo owners who haven’t configured it aren’t reachable. Assuming at least one or two people in your phone’s contact list have a call-enabled Echo, here’s how to get started. Open the Alexa app, and tap the speech bubble at the bottom of the screen. This will bring up the Conversations screen. Tap the person-shaped outline in the upper-right corner of the screen, and choose a person from the resulting list of contacts. Tap the message bubble, which will bring up a conversation page with that contact. Then, hit the blue microphone icon to record a voice message. You can also tap the keyboard button to type out a memo. When your contact receives your message, they’ll hear a chime and the LED ring around the top of their Echo speaker will take on a green glow. If they have the Alexa app installed on their smartphone, they’ll also receive a notification simultaneously, and they’ll be able to view, play, and respond to your message from within the app’s Conversation screen. How to start a call from the Alexa app Once you’ve mastered the basics of sending messages to other Echo devices, placing a call should be a snap. Here’s how to call someone with the Alexa app: Open the Alexa app and tap the speech bubble at the bottom of the screen. This brings up the Conversations screen. Tap the person-shaped outline in the upper-right corner of the screen, and choose a person from the resulting list of contacts. Tap the phone icon, which will initiate the call. It’s a little like Skype — the Alexa app uses your phone’s microphone and speakers to route voice data over a Wi-Fi or cellular connection, and your voice comes through via the recipient’s Echo. If you receive another call while you’re on a call, the incoming call will go to a different Echo device that supposed calls and messages. How to send a voice message from an Echo Sending a message from an Echo device is even simpler than sending one from the Alexa app. First, make sure the message’s intended recipient has enabled Alexa Calling & Messaging by opening the Alexa app, heading to the Conversations screen, and tapping the person-shaped outline in the upper-right corner of the screen. If the person has enabled calls and messages, you’ll see their name on the resulting list. Now say, “Alexa, send a message to [your contact’s name here].” Alexa will then prompt you for your message. Say what you’d like to send, and that’s it! Amazon will take care of the rest. To listen to an incoming message on an Echo speaker, simply say, “Alexa, play the message.” You’ll then hear the newest, unread message in your inbox. How to start a call from an Echo speaker Making a call from an Echo speaker is just as easy as sending a message. First, make sure the message’s intended recipient has enabled Alexa Calling & Messaging by opening the Alexa app, heading to the Conversations screen, and tapping the person-shaped outline in the upper-right corner of the screen. If the person has enabled calls and messages, you’ll see their name on the resulting list. Now say, “Alexa, call [your contact’s name here].” You’ll be connected as soon as your partner answers. To answer an incoming call on an Echo speaker, simply say, “Alexa, answer the call. To end the same call, say, “Alexa, Hang up.” If you get another call while you’re on a call, the incoming call will go to a different Echo device that supports calls and messages. How to disable Calling & Messaging There’s a potential privacy issue with Amazon’s Calling & Messaging. As of right now, you can’t block incoming calls. Imagine if a telemarketer finds out how to contact you through your speaker. To disable the feature once you’ve enabled, it, you’ll have to call the helpline at 1-877-375-9365 or to the Contact Us page, choose Amazon Devices > your Echo name > Echo Devices. Under “Select issue details,” choose Something Else, then under “How Would You Like To Contact Us,” select Phone. An Amazon employee will call you.

Education Laurel Wamsley · NPR · May 31, 2017 Google published a map of most-searched-for spellings, by state. Google Trends via Twitter It's National Spelling Bee week! That wonderful time of year when we honor young Americans' spelling prowess and admire their chutzpah for memorization and sussing out the "dreaded schwa." Lest we get too highfalutin (boastful, bombastic, vainglorious), Google has published a map that demonstrates the opposite of spelling prowess (ineptitude, lack of skill, incompetence). It has mapped, state by state, the words that people most often Google "how to spell." We've made a few corrections to the legend. This is the one to use pic.twitter.com/0Z8fUlzmHc— GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) May 30, 2017 Many of us Google words to see how they're spelled. And perhaps we don't even type "how to spell" because we trust that Google will nudge us in the right direction even if we, ignoramuses that we are, typed "highfaluting." Thank goodness no one sees which words we perennially misspell, because it turns out that this information can be a little embarrassing, even when aggregated by state. We're looking at you, New Hampshire. The most-searched spelling in the Granite State is "diarrhea." And though that is not an easy word to spell and may be trickier than "disease," which is tops in Utah, or "patient," which gets Googled in Oklahoma, no one wants to be from the diarrhea state. Then there is South Dakota, where folks are searching "how to spell college." The jokes write themselves! Come on, Google, try a little subtlety. Some of these search terms raise larger questions. Why are so many Rhode Islanders trying to spell "liar"? How can it be that people in New Jersey can't spell "twelve"? And really, New Mexico: "banana"? Perplexingly, the word for which Wisconsinites most often need spelling help is: "Wisconsin." We hoped that maybe there was a lesser-known Badger fight song called "How to spell Wisconsin", i.e. "W-I-S-C-O-N-S-I-N for the win!" but no. There is no song. Perhaps this map reflects something deeper, something innate about what drives us, well beyond spelling's reach. Hawaii is about people, Vermont is Little Europe, and in Kansas, diamonds are forever. It's always tomorrow in Arizona and sauerkraut season in Pennsylvania. Hallelujah for Delaware! In that case, we're doubly sorry, New Hampshire. It's spelled K-A-O-P-E-C-T-A-T-E.

And now, the Google Fiber customer service team wants you to experience the possibilities that the service has to offer-- with a store, called a Google Fiber Space. Photo Gallery View Gallery (10 images) Inline Inline Inline "Our customer service space is really a space where you can take Google Fiber for a spin and make it your own," said Caroline De Gantes, Google Fiber Business Operations. "You can experience what is super fast internet. What is a gigabit of speed, up to a thousand megabits per second. So you can stream some 4k videos to YouTube. You can come in, download a large file of data." And this Huntsville Google Fiber Space values local influence. They solicited a local artist to paint the mural in their store. “We painted a mural downtown, that big fish mural, and I guess someone at Google saw that and really liked it, and reached out to me," said Dustin Timbrook, the mural's artist. The opening of the store is just a preview of the growth and development that Huntsville can definitely anticipate. “This city is known for innovation, this is just one part of the innovation, and we’re really excited to see the innovation to come," De Gantes said.   Store hours of operation: Monday - Saturday: 10 a.m. – 7 p.m. Sunday: Closed Store address: 920 Bob Wallace Avenue SW Huntsville, AL 35801 *In the Shops at Merchants Walk shopping center, above Lululemon 34.711932 -86.586279 Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Popular Second person dies after pool incident in Florence Teenager’s body found after rescuers search Little River Canyon Huntsville Police make arrest in Thursday night murder, identify victim Latest News State Climatologist Reacts to President Donald Trump’s Decision to Withdraw From Paris Climate Agreement Will Your Driver’s License Work at Airports in 2018?

The car manufacturer announced that (previous CEO) Mike Fields would be replaced by Bill Hackett. This comes on the heels of partnership talks between Ford and Google falling apart. Bill Hackett, former big furniture guy, will take over Ford with a nervous board of directors throwing support behind him. Board members began to lose confidence in Fields and his ability to pull Ford in the right direction after losing a potential partnership with Google, and the Mexico factory debacle last year. When the decision was made to promote the newly-hired Bill Hackett from the company’s Smart Mobility division, it sent a clear message. The future of Ford is not in individual car sales. Currently Ford’s Fleets are where the company makes it’s money and with the driverless car on the horizon they are poised to break into the ride-sharing market. When Ford enters the ride-sharing market they’ll be bringing a fleet of cars that can bypass the 3rd party. Driverless vehicles will give Ford control from concept to consumer use. This is where the company will find it’s market share. Ford doesn’t have to compete with other ride-sharing programs, unless those other companies also design and manufacture their own vehicles (which Uber is working on). With driverless cars there aren’t external employees or 3rd party companies operating the equipment. The Ford driverless car fleet will be an in-house program. The future Ford Focus doesn’t want to live in your garage. It wants to pick you up for work and then go back to its loving home where properly trained Ford techs will attend to its every need. CEO Bill Hackett is going to have to steer Ford forward using the same ideas that the company was founded on. He’ll have to use cutting edge technology to mass produce something people are going to need. The driverless car presents new challenges and new opportunities. While experts try and work out the grid, visionaries are trying to determine the best possible uses. The world of tomorrow gives those who can’t or don’t drive the opportunity to travel without using public transportation. Driverless cars can empower the handicapped, free up the time workers spend commuting, and make the streets safer. Current ride-sharing services don’t reach everywhere – and driverless cars are going to be even less common until they become more mainstream. While Google and other tech companies are designing the tech that drives the driverless car – Ford is poised to take the first workable version and create swarming fleets of supercars, or at least thousands of tiny Ford Focus’ scurrying through every major throuroughfare like red blood cells through arteries. Ford might be the first of the major car companies to start testing driverless car fleets on a large scale – but others will surely follow suit. Tesla and Ford have been playing a game of one-upsmanship with the electric car and Toyota recently began exploring new options for it’s driverless car division. When Ford unveils its driverless car fleet it will be responsible for things that consumers normally have to worry about; fuel, maintenance, insurance and parking. Garages will be used for punk rock bands and storing boxes that say ‘old clothes’ on them. In the future we’ll be able to relax in a Ford Focus and watch movies on the way to work — we’ll probably watch Gone In 60 Seconds and tweet about the good ole’ days when people really knew how to drive.

Learn more Again? Some men got so bent out of shape over movie theaters hosting women-only screenings of the superhero flick Wonder Woman that they whined on social media that it was reverse discrimination. (This one is suing. Seriously.) Nobody tell them that on Thursday, Google released a Wonder Woman-themed update and an interactive project specifically designed to teach girls how to code. “Wonder Woman continues to be a symbol of female empowerment, breaking through stereotypes pervasive in comic books, gaming, and pop culture,” Google wrote in an announcement on its blog. The company’s Wonder Woman update to the game “DC Legends” is available on Google Play and will tie in content from the movie and allow players to “select Wonder Woman and channel her strength while they play.” Only 22 percent of gaming developers are women. The hope is that these girls will play the game and then be inspired to take on the interactive Wonder Woman-based coding project from Made With Code, Google’s initiative that works to boost the computer programming prowess of middle and high school age girls. Through the project, girls will be able to “code three unique scenes from the film, using introductory coding principles to help Wonder Woman navigate obstacles and reach her goal.” Google seems to understand what the men complaining about women-only film screenings might not want to admit: Gender inequality is alive and well in Hollywood and the tech industry. The company wrote on its blog “that girls are less likely than boys to be encouraged to pursue computer science and only 22 percent of gaming developers are women.” Oh, and Warner Brothers, the studio behind the film, has teamed up with Google to host a screening in Los Angeles just for girls. This might be proof that, when it comes to Wonder Woman, neither Warner Brothers nor Google are here for the reverse discrimination complaints.   Hero screenshot via Warner Brothers Recently on GOOD Education Strangers On A Delayed Train Hold A Heartwarming ‘Graduation’ Ceremony Gotham’s residents are the softies we always knew they were Education Liz Dwyer My Student Wrote ‘My Brother Dead.’ I Corrected His Grammar I told myself that compassion was an occupational hazard—until a frightening incident changed everything When compassion is an occupational hazard Education Gila Lyons The Heartbreaking (And Totally Preventable) Reason This Teacher Of The Year Quit Since 2009, cuts to Oklahama's education budgets have totaled over $1 billion Education Liz Dwyer These Are The Most Misspelled Words In Every State Only two states can claim "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"  Education Liz Dwyer This Service Dog In A High School Yearbook Is The Cutest Thing Ever Someone’s been a very good boy Education Kate Ryan Engineers May Earn Fat Paychecks—But Not Every Kid Is Meant To Be One A university admissions expert takes on America’s obsession with the notoriously stressful field Education Jackie Sizemore Spotify's Data Dump Just Revealed The Hidden Truth About Today's College Students What we listen to reveals a lot more than we realized Education Liz Dwyer The Strategy To Get More Military Service Members A College Degree A passing score on a 90-minute exam makes a path to a diploma Education Jonathan Smith High School Girls Invent A Straw That Detects Date-Rape Drugs It detects date rape drugs Education Tod Perry What's this? return to good.is About Advertise Contact Shop FAQ Newsletter Subscribe Terms Privacy Careers ©2017 GOOD Worldwide Inc Never miss another GOOD thing.

Apple has begun production of a high-end speaker with Siri-based digital assistant technology to compete directly with Amazon's Alexa-based Echo speakers and the Google Assistant-powered Home speaker, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Production is in the early stages, but the device could be unveiled as early as next week at WWDC, Apple's annual developer conference, according to the report. That would position the company to begin shipping in time for the winter holiday season. Inventec, which manufactures Apple AirPods, reportedly has landed the deal to build the intelligent speakers, and has begun expanding plant capacity to handle the demand. Apple aims to position its speaker not only as a digital assistant for the home, but also as a high-end audio device that will compete with Sonos and other leading speaker manufacturers, according to some reports. Apple already is a dominant player in the digital music arena with its iTunes music and video library. The device currently in production will have virtual surround sound technology and possibly will include sensors that automatically adjust volume based on the acoustics where the speakers are being used, according to the Bloomberg report. It also may use the company's HomeKit, which already works with Siri technology to automate the home, to act as a hub for home appliances, lights and other devices. Street Talk Speculation about the launch of a Siri-based speaker has heated up in recent weeks, following last month's report from KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo, who said there was a greater than 50 percent chance that Apple would unveil such a device at WWDC, which would give developers time to write new apps for it in time for the holiday shopping season. Apple had an installed base of 136 million iPhones in use in the U.S. as of March 31, plus another few million iPads and Apple computers. Most of the company's customers owned more than one Apple product, according to Michael Levin, a partner and analyst at Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. "It has also created a decent Home software suite that would allow whatever gadget they create to integrate its various hardware products -- smartphone, tablet, watch, computers, etc. -- into a home control system," he told the E-Commerce Times. "We expect that over time, at least a few million U.S. users would try out its new service and become a competitor to Amazon Echo and Google Home devices." Apple TV Groundwork Apple currently has some of same type of capability found in smart speakers built into its Apple TV box, noted Michael Jude, a research manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "This would likely be an adjunct device that would network to the existing Apple Home capabilities," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Apple has been angling towards a connected home capability for some time," Jude remarked. "Apple TV was sort of the opening salvo, but had a hard time getting traction because of its dependence on resolving content ownership issues," he explained. The rumored Siri-powered speaker "will extend Apple's capabilities, but will still be a less capable offering than Amazon's since it will lack the retail connections that Amazon can deliver," Jude said. "It will, however, put it at parity with Google -- perhaps ahead a little, since it will deliver iTunes and other content sources. Third Parties Key The strength of the Apple brand alone would provide the company with a competitive advantage with fans of the company, noted Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. However, unless the company were willing to open the platform up to third-party developers and hardware providers, it would lag Amazon and Google, he pointed out. "While being first to market with a home speaker device -- the Echo -- was a plus for Amazon, its real success is coming from all the third-parties that are looking at using Alexa on everything from smoke detectors to cars," McGregor told the E-Commerce Times. "Amazon also has a vast music library, book library and other retail ties to customers," he pointed out. "I would not bet against Amazon." Maturing Market Apple's move comes at a time when the core iPhone market has begun to mature. At the same time, Amazon and Google have taken a big bite out of the red hot digital assistant market. The Echo has propelled Amazon to record revenue and profits over the last couple of years, spinning off an entire new ecosystem of products that use its Alexa-based digital assistant technology. Google launched its own ecosystem of products and services anchored by the Google Assistant-powered Home speaker. It has a treasure trove of consumer search data and natural language capabilities to drive the use of Android-based mobile phones and other products based on its advanced development of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing Artificial Intelligence will Apple be next iCrowdNewswire – Jun 2, 2017 With iPhone sales slowing and the last new Apple product released two years ago, expectations are building for what the company will reveal next week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Some Apple watchers are counting on artificial intelligence. With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing AI in their conferences over the past two months, market analysts believe it is Apple’s turn. As the race for artificial intelligence heats up in Silicon Valley, some worry that Apple is already behind the game. “If Apple skips AI, I would consider that a significant miss on their opportunity,” said John Jackson, a Boston-based analyst for IDC. “Apple is late to this game. There is no other trick up their sleeve around this.” Apple, long known for its secrecy, declined to discuss specifics of the event but emailed a statement that its global developer community has earned more than $70 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. Rumors and early reports indicate the Cupertino tech giant may release a new iPad pro, and according to Bloomberg, a Siri-controlled home speaker to challenge Amazon Echo and Google Home. Gene Munster, a venture capitalist at Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said a home speaker would be a step in the right direction for Apple. “Artificial intelligence is fundamental to every company now,” Munster said. “We knew Apple was going to improve on Siri, and (the speaker) seems to line up. It makes logical sense.” In addition to the Siri speaker, rumors of a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, an updated MacBook Pro and a new iOS 11 have circulated on the Internet In preparation for next week’s Apple Developers Conference, the McEnery Convention Center facade gets a decorative re-skinning Friday, June 2, 2017, in San Jose, Calif. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group)  The five-day conference to be attended by more than 5000 developers — who each paid $1599 after winning a lottery — is moving from San Francisco to San Jose, where it will be held for the first time since 2002. Apple CEO Tim Cook will give the keynote speech in McEnery Convention Center at 10 a.m. on Monday. His speech will be streamed live on Apple’s website, or through the WWDC iOS app. Some experts pushed back on the notion that Apple is behind in the AI race, saying Siri is not the only AI-driven technology built by Apple. But they acknowledged that companies like Amazon and Google have made smart AI-driven devices marketable — Google identifies itself as an AI first company — as Apple has mostly worked behind closed curtains. “For the average Joe on the street, AI for Amazon is Echo and Alexa,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies. “Apple just chose not to label everything AI. Apple chose to let our experience with its devices speak for itself. But I think we are at a point where AI does matter in the advertising spiel.” In recent years, Apple has seen a decline in the sales of its main products, most noticeably the iPhone. Apple reported 50.8 million iPhones sold worldwide in the second quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million a year earlier. Expectations are that Apple will unveil a new iPhone in the fall for the device’s 10th anniversary. Apple Watch, its latest product from 2015, saw its 2016 sales number double from the year before, according to Cook in the last earnings call. Apple does not release Apple Watch sales numbers, but some analysts have estimated about 12 million of the devices were sold last year. If reports of a Siri home speaker are correct, Apple will be entering a growing smart home market with a closing window of opportunity. Both Amazon Echo and Google Home proved to be commercial successes. At its I/O conference in May, Google announced more features to its Home speaker, including the ability to place free calls, connect with Bluetooth and control more apps like HBO Now and Hulu. Apple’s Siri speaker reportedly comes with a virtual surround sound technology that give it an edge in sound quality over its competitors, according to Bloomberg. But the biggest draw may be its compatibility with other Apple devices and services. The speaker will likely be connected to the iPhone and Apple TV and services like Apple Music and the HomeKit home automation system. Although skeptical that current Amazon Echo owners will switch over to the Apple speaker, analysts believe Apple may be able to bridge the gap. “Apple has done a great job sewing up households as Apple households,” said Jackson. “A lot of us own iPhones and MacBooks. But it hasn’t been central to their messaging. Creating this type of innovation is darn hard, so they’re late.” Full article: http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/02/apple-needs-to-show-off-new-ai-technology-at-wwdc-next-week-analysts-say/ CategoriesUncategorized Tags(North America, Apple, artificial intelligence, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Asia, English, Europe, Facebook, Google, Latin America, Microsoft, Middle East Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Fayetteville Historic District Commission Presents 2017 Historic Preservation Award Next PostNext Public Outreach Policy at the Planning Commission Meeting Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing Artificial Intelligence will Apple be next iCrowdNewswire – Jun 2, 2017 With iPhone sales slowing and the last new Apple product released two years ago, expectations are building for what the company will reveal next week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.

Although skeptical that current Amazon Echo owners will switch over to the Apple speaker, analysts believe Apple may be able to bridge the gap. “Apple has done a great job sewing up households as Apple households,” said Jackson. “A lot of us own iPhones and MacBooks. But it hasn’t been central to their messaging. Creating this type of innovation is darn hard, so they’re late.” Full article: http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/02/apple-needs-to-show-off-new-ai-technology-at-wwdc-next-week-analysts-say/ CategoriesUncategorized Tags(North America, Apple, artificial intelligence, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Asia, English, Europe, Facebook, Google, Latin America, Microsoft, Middle East Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Fayetteville Historic District Commission Presents 2017 Historic Preservation Award Next PostNext Public Outreach Policy at the Planning Commission Meeting Search Recent Posts NFPA awards James M.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Mining user data, internet giants can be very greedy and even more tightfisted when it comes to paying taxes. Many of them are already in hot water in the EU, Russia and Australia, being investigated for unpaid taxes and collecting user data The economy ushered in by the internet, social media and mobile applications are affecting trade all around the world. While local internet companies are unable to run away from regulation and taxation, world giants are taking refuge in user habits to exempt themselves. The recent TL 300 million ($84.83 million) tax penalty imposed on Google by Turkey has brought this issue to the agenda once again. In fact, the problem is not specific to Turkey. Companies like Uber, Airbnb, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Google, in particular, are all in trouble with local authorities and regulatory agencies, across the globe, regarding tax payments and user data. The Irish operation of the giants like Facebook, Google and Microsoft is a constantly debated issue. Despite making most of their money in wealthy European Union (EU) states, these companies base themselves in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg, in order to unfairly benefit from the low amount of taxes in those countries. This is being considered as a major problem. Problem in the house These internet behemoths lobby individually as well as collectively under the roof of the EU alone. Moreover, the U.S., which supports these companies abroad, does not hesitate to bother them in regards to local politics. Companies that operate in countries like Luxembourg and Ireland for taxation advantages do the same in the U.S. and carry their official hubs to places that offer tax advantages. For instance, Apple chooses a small office in Nevada, a tax-favored place in Reno, a small town hundreds of miles away, but, not in California, where the company's management buildings are in Cupertino, which issues a high corporate rate. Collection of personal data Internet companies which have grown especially through advertising revenue on the internet have records of both tax and personal data. Facebook founder Zuckerberg got into trouble regarding the data he obtained from the school, during his company's establishment phase. Local enterprises argue that the internet giants are going unchecked and it is necessary to apply positive discrimination towards them. Even companies that complain about the fact that internet giants do not make investments in Turkey allocate a significant part of their digital advertising expenditures to these channels. In other words, not only state and regulatory institutions, but also all institutions should show similar sensitivities. Is personal data protected? Although a law on protecting personal data in Turkey has been issued, questions on following up and applying sanctions still remain unanswered. Social media and internet giants that are developing mobile applications are more reluctant to apply regulations and laws in terms of content than local firms. Think about it, a social media company boasting 30 million users here does not even have an office in Turkey. Australia, EU in pursuit of taxes The EU and Australia are giving no respite to global internet giants over taxes. They do not hesitate to impose massive penalties on companies that collect data in exchange of free services they offer to consumers and benefit from the digital advertising market and try to gather investments in their native countries. Social networking applications and search services, which have become a part of millions of people's lives in Turkey, have changed their habits of doing business. Time for games to take off from Turkey Recently, we have seen initiatives from Turkey making their marks in the gaming market. Voidrunner, Turkey's most comprehensive independent computer gaming project, initiated by StartersHub and produced by RealityArts Studio, will come to online gaming platform and marketplace, Steam. Voidrunner, a flight game that offers both multi-player and single-player modes with artificial intelligence, opens the gates to different worlds for the players, with its advanced graphics and comfortable gameplay. Having received a positive response from Steam, in just 3 days, Voidrunner has met players on Steam with Turkish language support on May 1. Voidrunner, with the support of Unreal Engine's manufacturer Epic Games, is successfully representing Turkey abroad and will publish its single-player Virtual Reality mode in just a few weeks. The developers are also working on the Playstation 4 version. Meanwhile, other innovations and additional features will continue to be produced for Voidrunner, and all patches and innovations will be offered for free. With a special price of TL 15, RealityArts presents our country's game sector with a rich gaming experience full of rich content, servers and single modes with artificial intelligence.

There’s efforts to change that, such as the non-profit that made a new podcasting app with all its links, buttons and instructions in the various languages of Iran, as we previously reported. The idea was to encourage an Iranian audience to connect with the broader world by making it as easy as possible for people there to navigate the plethora of audio on-demand content. With all the startups out there trying to hack growth, find new users and put out press releases about being the “fastest growing” Uber-for-Chalupas (or whatever), onlookers might assume that making products available in different languages would be one of the most obvious paths to growth. That’s not how it works, though. Even companies that are founded by non-English speaking teams design user interfaces in English, because the American market is still seen as the most valuable. Google and Udacity would like to see a web that’s friendlier to users all over the globe, but localizing an app isn’t as simple as running all the words through a free translator, so Google announced on its developers’ blog Wednesday that it has collaborated with the online learning company to build a free course on making the web comprehensible worldwide. “Today, localization is becoming more and more important because the internet user base is growing rapidly, especially in non-English speaking countries,” Bert Vander Meeren, Director of Localization at Google, says in the blog post. Localization Essentials is a free, beginner-level course on Udacity that the site estimates takes about two weeks. See Googlers describe it while making a stilted West Wing‘esque walk through Alphabet offices in this trailer: Alban Denoyel is the co-founder of a French startup called SketchFab, which makes it easy to view 3-D designs on 2-D screens. We recently reported on forays into WebVR. Even though its creators are French, all the words used on SketchFab’s product are in English. Its monolingual user interface is easy to explain—SketchFab has a small team and localizing takes a lot of work. “The product is hopefully simple enough to use even with very limited English knowledge,” he wrote the Observer in an email. “It speaks for itself that only 20 percent of our users are in the US, without localisation.” Meanwhile, Google has a whole localization team, enough to make its many apps in 70 languages. Team members built the course for Udacity, using the company’s very multimedia approach to online learning. Startups probably won’t be able to localize in quite so many places any time soon, but a company might be able to peel off a piece of a fresh funding round to swing a few more languages. Efforts like that make the world smaller and the web more accessible. Plus, the non-profit that made the Iran-oriented podcasting app, United for Iran, also proved that there are talented people eager to fill those gaps, but founders will need to enlist them. Even then, willing staff might not be enough. They’ll need guidance too. Paul Ford is the co-founder of Postlight and a prominent writer on the tech industry. His company builds lots of digital products for major companies, including a new Bloomberg app that overlays financial data onto any news article. “Let me tell you, localization is very hard, and it takes time and expertise,” he wrote the Observer. “So anything at all that helps and increases the knowledge about internationalization is a net good.”   SEE ALSO: AI Is Finally Bringing Conversation to the Consumer Business & Technology Observer Delivered to Your Inbox Sign Up Submit Must Reads Observer Politics Entertainment Lifestyle Arts Health Contact About Newsletters Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP We noticed you're using an ad blocker.

The announcement comes as hundreds of millions of Internet users have already installed ad blockers on their desktop computers and phones to combat ads that track them and make browsing sites difficult. These blockers threaten websites that rely on digital ads for revenue. Google’s version will allow ads as long as websites follow industry-created guidelines and minimize certain types of ads that people really hate. That includes pop-up ads, huge ads that don’t go away when visitors scroll down a page and video ads that start playing automatically with the sound on. Google says the feature will be turned on by default, and users can turn it off. It will work on both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Google says that even ads it sells will be blocked on websites that don’t get rid of annoying types of ads. Latest business videos But there might not be vast changes online triggered by the popular browser’s efforts. It’s a “small number of websites that are disproportionately responsible for annoying user experiences,” Google spokeswoman Suzanne Blackburn said. “I’m sure there are some publishers who will get hurt,” said Brian Wieser, an ad analyst with Pivotal Research Group. But in the long term, he says, cracking down on irritating ads should make the Internet experience better, encouraging people to visit sites and click on links. That, in turn, benefits Google. The company is also starting a program that could help publishers deal with users who have downloaded popular ad blockers. Some individual websites have come up with their own countermeasures. Forbes.com, for example, won’t let you read stories without disabling your ad blocker or logging in with Facebook or Google accounts, so the site can track you. Google would work with websites to set up messages telling users to disable their blockers for the site or pay for a version of it with no ads. It will take a 10 percent cut of those payments. To protect its ad business, Google has tried to improve user experiences in other ways. It launched a way for websites to load faster on phones. And it used its sway as the dominant search engine to push companies to make their sites mobile-friendly. Such sites show up higher in mobile searches. Google also has tried to address advertisers’ concerns about their ads running next to offensive content by banning its ads from some objectionable videos on YouTube, like those that promote discrimination or advocate illegal drug use. Google also won’t place its ads on Web pages with objectionable content — porn, for example, and or sites that promote suicide or violence. Facebook, too, is trying to make links from inside its universe less spammy for users. It says it’s trying to cut down on posts and ads in the news feed that lead to junky pages with “little substantive content” and “disruptive, shocking or malicious ads.” Tali Arbel is an Associated Press writer.

Google is inviting the public to do so using super-fast Internet speeds at its new customer service center near downtown Huntsville. The permanent space opened today above Lululemon Athletica at the Whole Foods-anchored Shops at Merchants Walk, allowing guests to experience the speeds for themselves before they sign up. Since debuting fiber-optic Internet, TV and phone service in north Huntsville last week, Google Fiber has been fielding questions about when they will expand to other areas in the city. "The scientists and engineers in this community really understand the value of super-fast Internet and they've really shown a great response coming out here," said Caroline de Gantes, head of business operations for Google Fiber Huntsville. Google hosted a pop-up shop in the parking lot of Merchants Walk before debuting the permanent space on 920 Bob Wallace Ave. S.W., Suite 323. The center is open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday and closed Sunday. Prices start at $50 a month for fiber Internet cable at speeds up to 100 megabits per second (Mbps) and go to $160 a month for gigabit Internet and 220 channels of TV. Phone service is $10 extra on any plan. The first area getting service is bounded on the west by Pulaski Pike and covers all of Huntsville north of Interstate 565 to the eastern city limits. de Gantes said residents should sign up on fiber.google.com/cities/huntsville to receive the latest updates. "We're thrilled this city that is built on innovation gets the value of super-fast Internet and we're thrilled to be offering more choices to the residents of Huntsville," she said. Artist Dustin Timbrook designed the mural inside the new Google Fiber customer service center in Huntsville. (Courtesy) Google operates similar customer service centers in cities where fiber-optic service is available. The Alabama location features a mural designed by Dustin Timbrook, a Huntsville artist and the creative director for Red Brick Strategies. Timbrook said Google contacted him about creating a design for their fiber installation vans after seeing his koi fish mural in downtown Huntsville. They later asked him to develop a mural for the customer service center. "With the van I had a bunch of really Huntsville-specific stuff cobbled together," Timbrook said. "With this one, I wanted one big bold image and it needed to be about space because it's Huntsville. Instead of showing the Saturn V, which we always do in everything, I gave the space shuttle some love." Timbrook and his girlfriend, Molly Kitts, were the first customers to sign up for Google Fiber after a press event last week in Huntsville. The service has not been installed yet because the couple lives on Grove Avenue north of downtown, but they are excited about the opportunity. He is also looking forward to having fiber-optic Internet at Red Brick's office on Northside Square, where he often handles large video files. "It's totally exciting," he said.

Source: AAP 3 Jun 2017 - 11:52 AM  UPDATED 3 Jun 2017 - 11:52 AM Tweet Netflix's stock climbed to a record high to close at $US165.18 ($A222.03) per share, up 1.3 per cent for the day, riding the wave of tech investors' bullishness on large-cap internet company stocks. Along with Netflix, the other three members of the so-called "FANG" quartet of internet stocks - Facebook, Amazon and Google (Alphabet) - each saw solid gains. Amazon crested the magical $US1,000-per-share mark to close on Friday at $US1,006.73 (up 1.1 per cent); Facebook was up 1.4 per cent to $US153.61; and Alphabet increased 0.9 per cent, to $US975.60 per share. But could Netflix investors also have been responding to the streaming leader's cancellation of two high-profile - and expensive - original series, Sense8 and The Get Down? While those actions could help assure Wall Street that Netflix is maintaining a sense of fiscal discipline, analysts warned against making too strong a connection. "I would hesitate to infer any direct correlation between the cancellation of those two series and Netflix's recent share price performance, which also seems to have benefited in part from a broader market rally," said Tuna Amobi, director of equity research at CFRA Research. The rise of Netflix's stock in recent weeks has been fuelled by expectations of international growth and the overall market movement toward high-growth internet stocks. "Everyone is looking for growth and shorting secular losers," said MoffettNathanson principal analyst Michael Nathanson. It's also worth noting that given Netflix's overall content spending, expected to top $US6 billion this year, even two relatively pricey shows are just a fraction of the total. Indeed, CEO Reed Hastings indicated that if anything, Netflix is willing to take more shots on goal by continuing to place creative bets on the original programming front. "You should have more things that don't work out, you have to get more aggressive," he said this week at the Code Conference. "The drive toward conformity as you grow is more substantial. As a leader, you want to drive people to take more risks."

Google isn't leaving users out in the cold, though, with new ad blocking features to improve the Google experience.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) During the annual I/O event, Google announced new features coming to the search engine that are very advertiser-friendly. Google hasn't left users out in the cold and has announced a new ad blocking system to improve the Google experience. Google Blocking Google has announced plans to introduce a new ad blocker for Chrome on desktop and mobile by 2018. The new ad blocker will target ads that it believes cause a bad experience for Chrome users when online. It's important to note that the new feature won't block all ads, but will target any that are considered intrusive or annoying to the user experience. These include pop-up ads that take up the entire screen or autoplayed videos with sound. The blocker will even target Google ads if they fall into those categories as well. "We plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018," Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's Senior VP of Ads and Commerce, said in a blog post. For anyone unfamiliar with the Better Ads Standards, it's the accepted practices when it comes to online advertising for members of the Coalition for Better Ads. The group was formed in 2016 with Google, Facebook, Unilever, and several other media and advertisement groups with the intent of finding a balance between the user experience and acceptable advertising. To help prep for this, Google will offer publishers what is referred to as an "Ad Experience Report." With it, publishers will be able to get a better grasp on Better Ads Standards to address intrusive ads on their own websites. Give-And-Take This seems like a necessary addition to Google's features, especially given the string of announcements at Google I/O in May. One such feature was the ability to track offline purchases to see if online ads were at all effective, allowing ad companies to adjust the ads appearing on Google to fit the user. While this new feature won't get rid of all ads, it does show that Google isn't so focused on the advertisers to alienate users. That said, there is a level of selfishness behind this as well. More and more people are using ad blockers on Google and YouTube to get around them and get straight to the content. Unfortunately for Google, ads are one of its main sources of revenue, so ad blockers definitely force Google to take a hit. With this new blocker, it at least gives Google a chance to still see some revenue from ads instead of nothing at all. TAG Google Chrome, Ad Blocking © 2017 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Malware poses the biggest threat to online security—and Google knows this, and is stepping up plans to secure its email services. The tech giant has announced that it will improve the security level of its email service, Gmail, by introducing a couple of new features. While doing so, the Mountain View California-based tech giant has promised to also improve on existing ones. Again, Google is tapping from the ability of machine learning to secure Gmail services. It’s everybody’s favorite these days—and no wonder Google is relying on it to combat phishing, especially at its early stages. The tech giant will rely on the ability of machine learning to detect malware attacks on its email service, Writing in a blog post a couple of days back, Google said: “Machine learning has helped Gmail achieve more than 99% accuracy in spam detection, and with these new protections, we’re able to reduce your exposure to threats by confidently rejecting hundreds of millions of additional messages every day.” No kidding—Google wants your mind to be at peace when using Gmail. It is stepping up Gmail’s security by rolling out click-time warnings for malicious links. It will also implement warnings to users whenever they want to act on unintended external replies, Softpedia reports. To this end, the company says it has upgraded its defenses against attachments that malicious. From past experience, Google has discovered that scammers tried to use crafty email attachments to creep past its security filters. Some of the measures the company took in such situations include rejecting such messages and informing the sender of the presence of virus in an email, and preventing users from sending messages with attachments that have been infected. In the case of infected attachments, Google prevented them from being downloaded. G Suite users, according to Google’s announcement, will now be warned by the new tool when replying to emails sent from outside of their territories or those not in their contact lists. This new tool has been added to Gmail as an extra layer of security to make sending and receiving of emails safe for all users. “Let’s take a deeper look at the new defenses against malicious attachments. We now correlate spam signals with attachment and sender heuristics, to predict messages containing new and unseen malware variants. These protections enable Gmail to better protect our users from zero-day threats, ransomware and polymorphic malware,” the company said. Following several phishing attacks against Google Docs last month, Google upgraded Gmail for Android. The app was updated with a notification feature to warn you anytime you are about visiting any malicious website. The malicious emails were sent from contacts, asking people [Gmail account users] to open a Google Doc. Anyone who falls for this, is immediately asked to give authorizations to a fake Google Docs app. Granting such authorization, will give the sender [hacker] the permission to read, send, delete and manage email, as well as manage contacts. The new update took the security level of the app one step higher than it was—you will now be notified with a warning when trying to phishing site from your mail.

Register Advertise Follow Subscribe to Search Marketing Daily Google's New Focus On Ad Blocking Should Diversify Revenue Gains by Laurie Sullivan  @lauriesullivan, June 2, 2017 In a much anticipated move, Google plans to introduce an ad blocker to Chrome early in 2018. It will allow publishers to block AdSense ads they don't like on their site. The move should gain favor with advertisers and publishers that have been asking for more controls in Google's ad platform, as well as from consumers looking for a better online experience. Chrome will stop showing ads, including those owned or served by Google, on Web sites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards. Sridhar Ramaswamy, SVP of ads and commerce, confirmed in a blog post that Google wants to build a better Web for everyone by eliminating intrusive ads online without removing all ads. So the company joined the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group dedicated to improving online ads, and stated several initiatives to help advertisers, consumers and publishers clean up online. advertisement advertisement The new ad experience begins with Funding Choices, a spinoff of Google Contributor that Google initially launched in 2014 and then shuttered as the company revamped the platform. The original service allowed Web site visitors to pay a monthly subscription fee to avoid seeing ads. Now in beta, Funding Choices enables publishers to serve a custom message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message would either invite the site visitor to either enable ads, or pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor. Funding Choices initially rolls out to publishers in North America, the U.K., Germany, Australia, and New Zealand, and become available elsewhere later this year An Ad Experience Report for best practices, which Google published along with the tools, should assist publishers to understand how the Better Ads Standards apply to their own Web sites. The report highlights "annoying ad experiences" in screenshots and videos that Google identified to make it easy to find and fix the issues. The move not only puts Google in a favorable light with advertisers, consumers and publishers, but will diversify the way Google generates revenue. Today the majority of Google's revenue comes from advertising. As Mary Meeker points out on page 327 of Kleiner Perkin's latest trends report, Google began as a search engine in 1998. The co-founders later created a holding company to support other services such as cloud services, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and hardware, and satellites. Overall, Google's sales now contribute 81% of the ad revenue from its online network, about $17.4 billion -- up from 71% a year ago. During the first quarter of 2017, total ad sales rose nearly 19% to $21.4 billion, according to company data. Google will take nearly 78% of the U.S. search ad revenue in 2017, according to the latest report from eMarketer. The biggest challenge, of course, will be for Google's parent company Alphabet to increase revenue from "Other Bets," which includes companies such as Nest, the self-driving cars unit, and the life sciences unit Verily. During the first quarter of 2017, "Other Bets" climbed 82% to $809 million. The downside is that the group has yet to find its footing. It had an operating loss of $3.6 billion in the final quarter of 2016. ad blocking, ad technology, google, search 1 comment about "Google's New Focus On Ad Blocking Should Diversify Revenue Gains".

Jeff Martin from IMF, June 2, 2017 at 7:31 p.m. So, Google (who controls the #1 advertising network) is going to create and control their own ad blocker (through a browser they control) designed to cripple (only competitor) "annoying ads." I will be very interested in what the FTC has to say.

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 83 Plus 1 on G+ 441 Share on Facebook 121 Share on Twitter Total Shares645 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed.

Cat Astrophy Deceptive is extremely hard to deal with and far more subjective. "Bad" can be virus ridden, or employing technical methods that can be detected automatically (like pop ups). Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. Cakefish ABP allows through Taboola, Outbrain and Revcontent. The polar opposite of acceptable ads. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... abc You can pay for it and I'll coast for free. Ha ha, I'm a dick! Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API Total Insecurity For some reason female users like this API... BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring My1 what the hell, how about they just pop a notif and let the phone do the rest? Imparus Okay so it was a bad example with facebook, since it is the notification API they are using not the vibration one, which means it follows the same rules as other applications. I should just have said a game might use it, but at the moment it is mainly used for BS ads. My1 okay, but I see no point in point in using the vibration on a website anyway. Imparus PWA, I mentioned game, since PWA is one of the new thing that is very likely to become huge in the next few years. Here you can try some few application made in it https://pwa.rocks/ so it is more that you should be ready for a paradigm change in what a website is, since the line between webapp and normal app will almost disappear. Example I use the QR scanner, so I don't have to have a dedicated app for it. My1 well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow. and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application. with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff Imparus I unfortunately don't have the time at the moment to explain all of these to you, so this will be quick rundown, and the rest you will have to research yourself if you are interested in it. "well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? " For most stuff it isn't a problem at all, as for game if they are simple enough optimization isn't as relevant. Most game would be written for an engine like unity or unreal, and one of the new thing in relation to PWA are modules, that will allow the use of engine like that, it also allow webapps to work completely offline. There will of course be some apps that are very heavy in computation on device that will make sense to run with native code that can run better, but there are being worked on optimizing things such as JS to make it run faster. "also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow." You can have the browser serve different code depending on the device, that actually isn't anything new. "and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. " PWA actually allow apps to work everywhere, instead of just the OS you coded it to. Having one single code base would be great for pretty much every company. "especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application." You can easily code for it to work offline, take the QR scanner on the side I linked you, I don't need internet to use it at all. Think of PWA like normal apps, if you use twitter then try using the PWA they have created. "with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff" Not really, this is one of the thing I will say you need to research yourself, since it will be quite a long explanation, I would start by looking into why chromeOS is more secure than Windows. I said there will be a huge grow with PWA over the next few years, since it is still very early in its development, only Firefox and Chrome support it at the moment and Edge will bring support in fall. AintaDamnThingFunny Right, but websites always ask me for permission if I want their notifications. Facebook using the vibrator API with your permission is one thing. Having an obtrusive add use it without your permission is another. Imparus That is because a website don't need to ask for permission, so it is more that Google should make it a permission check before allowing to use the vibration. Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! Rob Yeah, but some people love the vibrator API. hooch Holy shit I didn't even know this was a thing. Been using Firefox + uBlock Origin for a couple of years. blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. My1 cookie warning are annoying but it shows the scary relatity of all the sites that collect data with cookies. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Sonny Bono If they throw in free movies with the service I'd be down. I can already get anything I want on demand for no cost. I just appreciate watching random videos and I never know what I'm in the mood for. I'll just keep riding the links down the chain, bar tricks, gun porn, rocket engines, science experiments, old computers, animals and hunting videos... whatever it might be. ublock origin fixes the problem with ads - they don't exist any more - but not with popup windows on some questionable websites. abc Good for you. I use an adblocker and don't see any ads on Youtube. And I don't feel bad taking cents away from a multi-billion dollar corporation. I will never pay for streaming services because I like to own things. I could pay Netflix hundreds of dollars over the course of years, and the moment I disconnect, I am left with zero movies. I'd much rather grab some discs from the bargain bin. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Adam Margeson Forced Google surveys? Where are you seeing those served up? And, are you sure they're legitimately from Google? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but... Terra: how would you solve this on Chromecast, etc.?" tigerberry Playing a commercial WHILE PLAYING THE DAMN VIDEO I'M ACTUALLY WATCHING? Whoever came up with that should be forced to never use an adblocker ever again. Cakefish Wonderful. Please also add extension support to Android Chrome (it's the number 1 feature that it's missing, desktop Chrome wouldn't have been as popular without it) but this is a good start. Ghirahim Install Opera and have a wonderful life. Jun rip pornhub ads Rod I wonder when they will fix the Notification Download Service bug in v58. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719641# Rob Thank goodness. Somehow, we went from doing away with auto-play videos and ads years ago, only to have them pop up a lot in recent months. I'm sick of them. BC Google is finally making a move that I truly approve of. Ads, especially the invasive ones have really taken over. I don't care about banner ads that I see just once or ads on the side. The ones that infuriate me the most are those that obscure content, automatically play loud sounds/videos. Those that try to trick the user into installing something they don't obviously need, need to die in a fire. It's why I've installed Ghostery and use Mercury Reader to banish that bullshit to the depths of the internet hell. I'm also pleased that Google is being smart about this and blocking all invasive content...Even if it comes directly from their company because they need to be impartial and control these insanely bad adverts. Forcing a standard will hopefully make the internet a cleaner place, one that can support the advert model without being deliberately invasive or deceptive. Dragos Lucian The only thing that makes me use an adblocker on a lot of websites, is because, more often than not, you don't even need to click on the ads to be presented with a buttload of new tabs or individual pages. You just need to click on a blank area and boom ! You can barely make your way back to the page you initially were. If those type of ads go away, then I'll make sure to uninstall my adblocker. Till then, fuck everyone who posts those type of ads on their websites in order to gain revenue. Make your money off selling socks. Abhishek Mittal Does this mean my phone wont start buzzing and downloading unwanted apps without my permission? This is huge, a great step by google in improving quality of the internet Spinkick Does it bother anyone that google is the one that decides which ads are bad? abc Google means that they are going to block their competitors ads and only allow their own.

Eric Schmidt, Jared Kushner -- (Twitter, screenshot) Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory The day after the executive chairman of Google’s parent company praised President Donald Trump’s embattled son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the White House announced that a Labor Department division investigating discrimination claims against government contractors was being shut down. According to Sarah Lacey – who connected the dots at Pando — Google will benefit from the closure since it was facing government scrutiny for underpaying women employed by the tech monolith. As noted, Google was fighting with the government over discrimination claims, arguing that compiling and maintaining the salary records was too  financially burdensome for the company with $28 billion in annual income. After complaining that Google would have to spend approximately $100,000 to do the paperwork required by the Labor Department, DoL attorney Ian Eliasoph took a shot at the response on Friday, stating: “Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water.” That was then. In a piece that appeared on Sunday, May 28 in the New York Times, Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, was one the few cited in the mostly critical examination of Kushner’s White House tenure to say something nice about the young real estate developer-turned Trumps right-hand man. Asked about Kushner’s reported work on business innovation for the White House, Schmidt stated: “His passion on this is very real.” As Lacy noted — while admitting that it might be a coincidence – the day after Schmidt’s comment was widely reported, the White House on Monday announced the shuttering of the very department looking at Google. “The Trump administration is planning to disband the Labor Department division that has policed discrimination among federal contractors for four decades, according to the White House’s newly proposed budget, part of wider efforts to rein in government programs that promote civil rights,” the Washington Post reported. As Lacey writes, “As luck would have it, three days after the DoL reminded Google that compliance with its anti-discrimination investigation was the price of being a government contractor, and just hours after Eric Schmidt issues his bizarre public defense of Jared Kushner, news broke that the Trump administration was planning to disband the organization doing the investigation.” Report typos and corrections to [email protected] About the AuthorTom Boggioni is based in the quaint seaside community of Pacific Beach in less quaint San Diego.

Pre-orders are now being accepted on the Google Store site in Canada for the speaker, as well as other retailers such as Best Buy, for the price of $179 CDN. See also: Make your own Google Home commands with new shortcuts setting 3 weeks ago This is just the third country in the world where you can buy Google Home. It launched in the US in November, and earlier this year sales for the speaker began in the UK. Pre-orders for Google Home in Canada will begin shipping from the Google Store site in about two to three weeks, according to the listing. Officially, the launch is supposed to happen on June 26, where it will also be sold at Bell, Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Staples, The Source, Telus, Visions, and Walmart. If you buy the speaker from Best Buy, it will throw in a Chromecast dongle for free. In a blog post, the company also announced that its Google Assistant service, which works with the speaker, will also work in Canada for both English and French speaking residents. During Google I/O 2017 in May, the company announced that it will begin selling Google Home in more countries later this year, including Australia, France, Germany and Japan. It also announced plans to add a number of new features to the speaker in the coming months, including a way for owners to make outgoing hands-free voice calls. That feature will begin rolling out sometime in the next few months, but just for US owners. So far, the company has not announced just how many Google Home speakers it has sold.

Friday, June 2, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Outsourcing Your Online Presence to Facebook Dave Winer: I don’t know what your privacy settings are. So if I point to your post, it’s possible a lot of people might not be able to read it, and thus will bring the grief to me, not you, because they have no idea who you are or what you wrote. It’s supporting their downgrading and killing the web. Your post sucks because it doesn’t contain links, styling, and you can’t enclose a podcast if you want. The more people post there, the more the web dies. John Gruber (Hacker News): You might think it’s hyperbole for Winer to say that Facebook is trying to kill the open web. But they are. I complain about Google AMP, but AMP is just a dangerous step toward a Google-owned walled garden — Facebook is designed from the ground up as an all-out attack on the open web. Marc Haynes’s Facebook post about Roger Moore is viewable by anyone, but: It is not accessible to search engines. Search for “Marc Haynes Roger Moore” on any major search engine — DuckDuckGo, Google, Bing — and you will get hundreds of results. The story went viral, deservedly. But not only is the top result not Haynes’s original post on Facebook, his post doesn’t show up anywhere in the results because Facebook forbids search engines from indexing Facebook posts. Joe Cieplinski: Look, I get that I’m the nut who doesn’t want to use Facebook. I’m not even saying don’t post your stuff to Facebook. But if Facebook is the only place you are posting something, know that you are shutting out people like me for no good reason. Go ahead and post to Facebook, but post it somewhere else, too. Especially if you’re running a business. The number of restaurants, bars, and other local establishments that, thanks to crappy web sites they can’t update, post their daily specials, hours, and important announcements only via Facebook is growing. That’s maddening. Want to know if we’re open this holiday weekend? Go to Facebook. Tossrock: I deactivated my Facebook account several months ago, and it’s been about 90% great, 10% frustrating. It’s great for all the obvious reasons (less timesuck, less compulsion to endlessly scroll your life away, no notification interruptions). The frustrations are real, though. Primarily it’s around events and photos. There are some communities I participate in that regularly organize events through Facebook, and now I don’t really get invited to those anymore. It’s also harder to organize events where you casually invite people you don’t know as well. Facebook Search Web Comments Stay up-to-date by subscribing to the Comments RSS Feed for this post.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !dy164c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs454MarketDriveGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!dy164c:....,..... Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd... Mainly I get approximately 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours constantly.And magnificent factor with this job is the fact that you can supervise time when you do the job and for just how long as you wish for and you attain a check week by week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now needa I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable. Lars Jeppesen Not available in my countries... Gen. Chang The point is to force the ad industry and websites to change the way they operate. Not reward them for more bad behavior. If it was not for the privacy intrusive models they use, there would not be as big a problem.

Roston - Jun 2, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The new Wonder Woman movie is about to launch in theaters, and ahead of its release comes a new educational product from Google based on the movie. Released as part of its Made with Code initiative, Google has released a Wonder Woman-themed educational coding project that teaches kids (and adults!) the basics of coding using fun, interactive tools with instant results. Google has many versions of its coding projects; anyone who has used a past project will have a general idea of what to expect in the new Made with Code Wonder Woman project. Open the interactive environment here and you’ll be greeted with a picture under a grid, a character, and some actions. The goal is to choose the character and ‘code’ it to perform a specific action. In the first step, this action is running forward two blocks, jumping the distance of two blocks, then landing in a final block. The coding is achieved by piecing together blocks with pre-set actions, then clicking ‘Play’ to run the code. Users get to see the on-screen character react according to their code blocks.

Gboard v6.3 enables search suggestions in the Google app and widget for some Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 9:32am PDTJun 1, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 77 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares159 Applications News Google dropped a new version of Gboard last night, which includes a number of cool improvements to search. Some people are reporting another interesting feature in the form of Google search suggestions int he Google app and widget. Not everyone seems to have this, though. On older versions of Gboard, the keyboard's suggestion bar disappears when doing a search. That's still what it looks like for myself and most other AP staff after the update to v6.3. However, we've heard from a not insignificant number of people who are seeing the suggestion bar. This appears when searching via the Google widget and within the Google app. It seems to work just like the suggestion bar elsewhere. Start typing, and the keyboard guesses what word you might want to use next based on your typing history and the power of Google's prediction engine. Just grab the new version of Gboard and open a search to see if you've got it. Download QR-Code Gboard - the Google Keyboard Developer: Google Inc.

Artem Russakovskii Yes https://plus.google.com/+ArtemRussakovskii/posts/aYxevnQNXK7 https://plus.google.com/+ArtemRussakovskii/posts/BsXuhKZQbmz F4LL0U7 I got that too, briefly. I think they accidentally pushed out the dogfood version. mike shwilly Somehow the suggestions/corrections bar doesn't even appear for me on menus like that. Anyone got a clue? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fcf5ae1af260f403d6fe67b4a16960601a0f678f624415845c966be49de6c152.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7db6affa5d2544f41d448de7188c46494be0ca138cb1088830fd557174531b65.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0729dbe9f8f2b6951428091c0dc20c66822aa0bd1fb3d8c8198fba4181bd896a.png Artem Russakovskii That's the mystery - I'm not seeing suggestions either, but many are. mike shwilly I think i had this problem since Nexus 5. It has always been really annoying. Suicide_Note Deftones are a terrible band. Hurricane Andrew I still do not see it on my S7 Edge. I wonder if launcher choice makes a difference. I use Action Launcher. Would be interesting to know what launcher people who are and are not seeing this are using. Yuri Vidal on my s7 it works. are you a beta tester? i also dont use touchwiz launcher. the suggestion bar works for me on chrome, and on google app too. jkl888 I see the suggestions on my phone Artem Russakovskii I'm on the Pixel Launcher, tried both Google app 7.2 and 7.3, and Gboard 6.2 and 6.3, and I don't have this. Reply and post your launcher, Google App version, and Gboard version, and whether you have suggestions or not. Armando Rodriguez Have you notice that the "short" height is shorter than previous versions? abqnm Are you on an S8 or G6? They tweaked some proportions on the odd aspect ratio devices. The S8 doesn't have the hugely tall spacebar anymore, which may be why it seems that way. If you're not on one of those I'm not sure as it seems the same to me. Armando Rodriguez Nexus 5 DPI at 420 Raz Have it. Nova Beta, GBoard 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, Google app 7.3.19.21.arm64. The new GBoard just asked for access to my SMS to improve the suggestions. Bruno Logerfo wait since when there's a dark theme for the google widget? João Ricardo He problaby has a theme kervation I am using a Google Pixel XL with the stock pixel launcher, running Google app version 7.3.19.21 & Google Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061. I have the suggestion bar for the Google app and also the Chrome beta browser and regular Chrome browser. I also have search suggestions show up when typing in the Google app. JATIN BANSAL I think this is also new. Earlier in dark themes, they used to have a white glow around emoji but now it is gone. I like it now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8bcc901c9f60b97c05dc467df6fa4838f96cabcfbf6421714f5ec7189958205.png roberto.elena I wished the keyboard had a dynamic theme that would change automatically based on the app being used, like the status bar does: Youtube = red, WhatsApp = green, Facebook = blue, etc. thegrau There's a third party keyboard that does exactly that. Can't remember the name, but I believe it's based on AOSP Yuri Vidal chroma keyboard Łukasz Ordon There is also Xposed module that can do that...

EmirSc minium has this. thecoolkid Thank god! I hated the glow, not very material design... Lexster Okay, but...when will they put a freaking space after punctuation? It's not that difficult, but after using Swiftkey, I really can't get used to having to put a space after punctuation. catalysto I would NOT want that. Don't need my OCD flaring up with unnecessary spaces. Though, sure, it should probably be an option. Lexster How are spaces after periods of sentences unnecessary? hype67 In acronyms, when the dot doesn't denote the end of a sentence. As decimals. Others situations I can't remember off the top of my head. Lexster USe acronyms with periods a lot, do you? I can't remember the last time I did. It's not generally required for acronyms. You put FBI, not F. B. I. But, yes, it's a little annoying with decimals, but that can generally be programmed to recognize if the space isn't needed. Swiftkey often does. It misses sometimes, sure, but usually works well. If a field needs an IP address, it usually knows this and doesn't put a space. And yes, it can be annoying with website names, but it's much easier to backspace every once in awhile than have to hit space after every single period or question mark. Łukasz Ordon Just press space twice :P It puts full stop AND a space after it... Lexster Yes, but I prefer having the space after punctuation. Doesn't require two taps of the space bar. And it only enters periods. Łukasz Ordon Oh well... You can't make everyone happy... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Typing URLs and email addresses is a giant pain in SwiftKey. catalysto When it's the last sentence. Lexster Okay? Well, it doesn't add a space until you type a letter, so if it's the last sentence, there wouldn't be a space unless you typed something else. catalysto A period does not always signify the end of a sentence though. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman So glad it doesn't do that. One of the worst things in SwiftKey. Typing URLs and email addresses was such a giant pain in the ass. Hitting space after I type a period isn't a big deal to me AT ALL. Especially since I'm used to typing on a keyboard anyway, so do it automatically. Lexster There some reason it can't be an option? Or do you think because you don't want it that no one should? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman You didn't indicate an option. An option might be okay, although I think it might break enough things as to cause them problems overall. Sometimes options that break the experience are left out to prevent frustration when users forget they're responsible for their own problem. ozzyager I do see suggestions when doing a search. I also recieved the dog bone version first, before being updated again shortly thereafter. Maybe just a coincidence? catalysto Same thing happened to me. It's still working after updating to the non-beta version, too. Though I'm in the beta program for Gboard, so maybe that has something to do with it? My version number is 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, in case anyone is curious. Łukasz Ordon That Gboard app version with dog paw should not be released publicly. It indicates 'dogfood' version (as googlers call it) which should be tested only inside Google. Dogfood is just debug version of normal app (don't quote me on that tho) ozzyager Correct. This is why I wondered if there was any connection between that version being released by accident to some, like myself, and only some seeing the suggestions when doing a search. Of course it might just be a server side update that is being tested, etc. Łukasz Ordon I've myself got dogfood version but shortly after (like 5 mins later) I've received another update with normal apk... Armv7 version btw :p roberto.elena It also gives suggestions in Chrome while in incognito mode. abqnm While that may be unwanted, it should be pointed out that it now gives suggestions in the Chrome address bar. Period. Previously it did not suggest anything at all in the Chrome address bar, incognito or no. I still don't have it in search though. It does work when typing to Assistant, but it may have done that previously. boop Can someone explain the nav bar in the second pic? Łukasz Ordon It's probably Pixel phone navbar... destinyhud pixel phone if u mean the down arrow then when u click a bar the left become a down arrow boop The color, I mean destinyhud thats probably Gboard's feature. maybe with 6.3 Hurricane Andrew Running Action Launcher 3, Google app version 7.3.19.21, Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061 and do not have the suggestions in the search app. Łukasz Ordon Talking about Google app itself... apparently, cards in Google Now feed have new design now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5fbd4b5888c4ad6d684f6ab3ba7589a3354607b05f565c0b7aed404237d8d8dc.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ed878edc7fa830f93bf49db1a7d5c8b4267ae6cada762eb9d0e723312cd72c5a.png Łukasz Ordon Aaaaand it's gone... Now cards are normal for me... Take look at football match card (I mean the 'title' of it) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/150e49575e0870a2a9ca2cf19dd64acd4a3c720df42161667388f2bc104c7a1b.png Federico Rios Im still here with the 5.2.1 version before it called Gboard in Android O DP2 and im SO HAPPY :D whispy_snippet I've never understood why this feature hasn't always existed. Teja The word prediction is the only thing I worry about. Swiftkey is way better than Gboard which made me to switch back to Swiftkey. Michael Oghia Does anyone else experience problems with the spell check feature? Sometimes I misspell a word, it tells me it's misspelled, but then doesn't offer any suggestions. It used to work better a few years ago (when it was still just keyboard or whatever it was called). Vratislav Jindra I would swear I had this yesterday. Today it disappeared.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is giving publishers six months to prepare for the new tool, which will block ads on sites with “bad advertising experiences” and will reportedly be turned on by default in both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. While we’ve known about the Google ad blocker since April, this week marks the first time that Google has confirmed the move. Sridhar Ramaswamy, SVP of ads and commerce, explained in a blog post on Thursday that “we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018.” Thankfully, before the ad blocker goes into effect, Google will give publishers the opportunity to use its new Ad Experience Report tool, which elucidates the differences between an acceptable experience and one that doesn’t conform to the Better Ads Standards. Once the publisher has determined which ads won’t fly under the new system, they can check this post for ads to use instead. This might sound troublesome for publishers who depend on ad revenue to keep their sites up and running, but considering the fact that 26% of US internet users already use third-party ad blockers, this could end up helping. Third-party ad blockers, like Adblock Plus, block each and every ad, regardless of how annoying or intrusive they are. Google’s ad blocker will only block ads when they don’t conform to the Better Ads Standards, which means that sites with tame ad experiences will be spared. Google is also introducing another tool called Funding Choices, which will allow publishers to “show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker, inviting them to either enable ads on their site, or pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under ads ,  google ,  mobile advertising Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next New 'miracle' material could be the end of shattered iPhon...

However, Home was only available in the US at first. It came to the UK later, but America's neighbor to the north was left hanging. Not anymore—Google Home launches in Canada on June 26th. Home will understand both English (the kind with extra "ehs" and "sorrys," I guess) and Canadian French when it launches later this month. The feature set appears to be the same, so many smart home devices and services will work with Google Home out of the box. Pre-orders are live at the Google Store and Best Buy Canada. It looks like the price will be $179.99. It will be for sale at plenty of other retailers on launch day, including Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Staples, The Source, Telus, Visions, and Walmart.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Google Increases Maximum Android Bug Bounties to $200,000 Google Increases Maximum Android Bug Bounties to $200,000 By Ryan Whitwam on June 2, 2017 at 3:01 pm Comment Android has a reputation for poor security, but that’s a result of past failings. Most security flaws you hear about now affect old builds of the OS, or require clever social engineering to get the user to weaken device security. The versions of Android being released now are vastly more secure than what Google was putting out years ago. In fact, no one has managed to claim Google’s largest bug bounties for Android. So, the company is increasing the rewards to as much as $200,000. Google started the bug bounty program for Android about two years ago. It works just like other bug bounties the company has used for other products. Security researchers who can demonstrate an exploit get a cash prize, the amount of which varies based on the severity of the hack. Then, Google gets to fix the bug and avoid future security issues. Still, no one has submitted a working exploit for Android’s core components, even when such an exploit is worth $30,000-$50,000. So, by increasing the reward, Google hopes it will attract more researchers and engineers to the bug bounty program. The increases reward applies to two bounties; one for vulnerabilities in TrustZone or Verified Boot, and the other for a remote kernel exploit. Android is based on the Linux kernel, which has given the platform great flexibility over the years. However, the Linux kernel also comes with baggage. It has been the cause of several significant security breaches known as remote kernel exploits. An example of this would be the TowelRoot exploit, which could be used by users to gain root on a device. Of course, hackers could also use remote kernel exploits like that to infiltrate devices and steal data. The bounty for a new remote kernel exploit has gone up to $150,000 from $30,000. Verified Boot process. Google considers a flaw in TrustZone or Verified Boot to be an even more serious matter. TrustZone is actually an ARM technology related to the SoC inside your device. It ensures that biometric data (fingerprints), DRM, and boot settings are kept in a trusted secure environment. That’s all data you definitely don’t want exposed to hackers. Verified Boot was introduced in Android 4.4 KitKat as a way to make sure system software has not been tampered with each time a device starts up. Devices on Android 6.0 and higher actually alert the user to problems with Verified Boot. An exploit that can silently alter the system would be a big problem. Google has increased the bounty for both TrustZone and Verified Boot from $50,000 to $200,000. Google will probably increase the rewards yet again if this still doesn’t result in a valid report. Eventually it’ll be worth the time for someone to put in the necessary effort to uncover a new bug. After all, no software is perfect.

With iPhone sales slowing and the last new Apple product released two years ago, expectations are building for what the company will reveal next week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Some Apple watchers are counting on artificial intelligence. With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing AI in their conferences over the past two months, market analysts believe it’s Apple’s turn. As the race for artificial intelligence heats up in Silicon Valley, some say Apple is already behind the game. “If Apple skips AI, I would consider that a significant miss on their opportunity,” said John Jackson, a Boston-based analyst for IDC. “Apple is late to this game. There is no other trick up their sleeve around this.” Apple, long known for its secrecy, declined to discuss specifics of the event but emailed a statement that its global developer community has earned more than $70 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. Rumors and early reports indicate the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant might release a new iPad pro, and according to Bloomberg, a Siri-controlled home speaker to challenge Amazon Echo and Google Home. Gene Munster, a venture capitalist at Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said a home speaker would be a step in the right direction for Apple. “Artificial intelligence is fundamental to every company now,” Munster said. “We knew Apple was going to improve on Siri, and (the speaker) seems to line up. It makes logical sense.” In addition to the Siri speaker, rumors of a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, an updated MacBook Pro and a new iOS 11 have circulated on the internet. The five-day conference to be attended by more than 5,000 developers – who each paid $1,599 after winning a lottery – is moving from San Francisco to San Jose, where it will be held for the first time since 2002. Apple CEO Tim Cook will give the keynote speech Monday morning. His speech will be streamed live on Apple’s website, or through the WWDC iOS app. Some experts pushed back on the notion that Apple is behind in the AI race, saying Siri is not the only AI-driven technology built by Apple. But they acknowledged that companies like Amazon and Google have made smart AI-driven devices marketable – Google identifies itself as an AI first company – as Apple has mostly worked behind closed curtains. “For the average Joe on the street, AI for Amazon is Echo and Alexa,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies. “Apple just chose not to label everything AI. Apple chose to let our experience with its devices speak for itself. But I think we are at a point where AI does matter in the advertising spiel.” In recent years, Apple has seen a decline in the sales of its main products, most noticeably the iPhone. Apple reported 50.8 million iPhones sold worldwide in the second quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million a year earlier. Expectations are that Apple will unveil a new iPhone in the fall for the device’s 10th anniversary. Apple Watch, its latest product from 2015, saw its 2016 sales number double from the year before, according to Cook in the last earnings call. Apple does not release Apple Watch sales numbers, but some analysts have estimated about 12 million of the devices were sold last year.

Educational Technology June 2, 2017 Chromebook takeover signals major shift in education…but not in the way you may think Filed under: Educational Technology — admin @ 12:42 am BY MERIS STANSBURY, eSchool News Google’s Chromebooks are now the most used devices in K-12 classrooms across the U.S.  The use of Google in the classroom is true Googlification, or modeling learning off of Google’s own employee skillset, in that the use of Google and Chromebooks in the classroom aims to turn today’s students into creative and collaborative problem-solvers that know how to intuitively harness online and in-hand technologies. “Google is helping to drive a philosophical change in public education—prioritizing training children in skills like teamwork and problem-solving while de-emphasizing the teaching of traditional academic knowledge, like math formulas,” writes the New York Times. http://www.eschoolnews.com/2017/05/17/google-shift-education/ Share on Facebook Comments Off No Comments No comments yet.

Google’s rivals have sent anti-trust concerns to the EU competition council for years. Under EU rules, firms found in violation of competitiveness regulations can receive a fine worth 10 percent of yearly turnover. For Alphabet’s subsidiary, this translates to about $9 billion and change.

Can’t rest until you know which summer blockbuster your pals enjoyed most? If you love finding out your friends’ opinions, I have good news: you don’t have to go around asking them individually. Thanks to the power of social media polls, you can quiz your friends and get responses in real-time. Next time you have to know whether vanilla or chocolate is more popular, here’s how to collect the thoughts of those closest to you. Twitter Polls In 2015, Twitter rolled out native support for polls, and they couldn’t be simpler. Just create a new tweet on the web or mobile versions of Twitter, and click the small Poll icon at the bottom of the tweet draft. You’ll have the standard 140 characters to type out a question, and can add up to four choices for readers to respond with. Finally, you can select the amount of time the poll stays alive for. The default is one day, but you can run a poll for a few minutes or an entire week. Which of these @MakeUseOf sections is your favorite? — Ben Stegner (@stegnersaurus) May 30, 2017 Obviously, your Twitter poll will only reach your followers to start, so the amount of responses you get will depend on how large your following is 10 Twitter Tips Most Pros Don't Even Know 10 Twitter Tips Most Pros Don't Even Know Read More . As long as your Twitter account isn’t private, anyone can retweet the poll just like any other tweet. If you start a poll about a hot topic, it could quickly spread beyond your sphere. To share the poll with more people, you can also embed it like you would a normal tweet. Pasting the URL to the tweet or using the embed code will let you add it to your blog or share on other social networks. Users must be signed into Twitter to vote, however. New poll!

Or want to share your polls across more services? The ultra-simple site Straw Poll is for you. It doesn’t require any sign-up or authentication. Simply type a question for your social media poll, enter as many choices as you need, and you’ve got a link you can share with your friends anywhere. Once a user completes it, they can view the results or share it with their friends via social links. To prevent spam and duplicate answers, Straw Poll offers a few extra options. The drop-down box below the poll offers three choices for blocking duplication: IP Duplication Checking — Users can’t vote from the same IP address multiple times. This will prevent two people living in the same house from both voting. Browser Cookie Duplication Checking — Instead of checking the IP address, Straw Poll will check the user’s browser cookies to see if they’ve voted yet. This allows two people in the same house to each vote, but if someone cleared their cookies What Are Supercookies, and Why Are They Dangerous? What Are Supercookies, and Why Are They Dangerous?

No Duplication Checking — The poll does not check for duplicate votes, so somebody could vote as many times as they wanted to. You’ll find two additional options when creating polls. Improve spam prevention will add a CAPTCHA to your poll, requiring users to solve a quick puzzle to prove they aren’t robots. If you select Allow multiple poll answers, users can check as many options as they want. This service doesn’t offer an option to end polls after a certain time. Overall, Straw Poll is the easiest way to create a quick social media poll that you can share anywhere. It doesn’t require your friends to sign up, works great on mobile, and collects the data you want in a simple form.

Google Forms If you’re running an official quiz for a class assignment or something similar, you might need more flexible options and actionable data than a Twitter poll or Straw Poll provides. That’s where Google Forms comes in. This tool in the free Google Docs suite lets you create polls with different types of questions, add multiple pages, and send all the data to a spreadsheet for analysis. Head to Google Forms to get started. Like other Google tools, you can start with a blank form and build your own or use a template for common events like an RSVP, t-shirt ordering, or contact info. Question forms include: Short answer — Let someone type a sentence or two, like their name or a brief thought on a topic. Multiple choice — Standard question with multiple answers, only one of which the user can select. You can also add an Other option here. Checkboxes — You provide multiple answers and the respondent can select as many as apply. Linear scale — Set a numbered scale and ask the user to rate how often they do something or how strongly they feel on a question. Forms Options To add some flow to your poll, you can add images and YouTube videos using the right sidebar. You could ask how a particular image makes someone feel, or if they laughed at a YouTube video, for instance. Dividing your poll into sections will break it into multiple pages, and you can send users to these sections based on their answers. For instance, if you’re creating a poll to see which iPhone apps people use most often, your first page could simply ask Do you own an iPhone? If the user said No, you can specify that choosing that answer sends them to the end of the poll. This lets you ask completely different sets of questions How to Use Google Forms to Create an Interactive Workflow How to Use Google Forms to Create an Interactive Workflow Google Forms is the office workflow interface you didn't know you needed. Use Google Forms to collect information and in the next step add details or trigger a process. Read More depending on how earlier ones are answered. If surprise is a key factor in your poll, you can even shuffle the question order. To make your form a true quiz, click the Settings gear in the upper-right corner, then select the Quizzes tab. This lets you assign point values to questions. Forms will automatically grade them and show the respondent their score. Once your poll is all set, click the Send button to get a shareable link or send via email. After some people have answered, switching to the Responses tab lets you see how they responded. This also neatly formats the data into graphs and charts for easy analysis. Forms will import the responses into a new Google Sheets spreadsheet, so you can use that data elsewhere if you like.

Now, the company has confirmed this will be happening in early 2018, though the technology doesn’t work like most third-party blockers. The ads that Chrome will block, which includes those owned or served by Google, are those that violate the standards set by the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group that counts the likes of Facebook and Google among its members. Ads that are deemed “beneath a threshold of consumer acceptability” include full-page interstitials with countdowns, flashing ads, and those that unexpectedly play sounds. If just one of the ads on a site doesn't follow the Coalition’s standards, Chrome will block all of them, not just the offending advert(s). Google is also rolling out the Ad Experience Report. The tool warns publishers of any ads on their site that violate the coalition’s standards, while also providing screenshots and videos showing what constitutes an annoying ad. Developers can resubmit their site for review once they address the issues. Additionally, Google is working on a tool called “Funding Choices,” which allows publishers to display a customizable message to visitors asking them to, for example, disable their third-party ad blockers or pay a subscription to go ad free. The number of people using ad blockers jumped 30 percent last year. Google says this “reduces the ability for publishers to continue creating free content and threatens the sustainability of the web ecosystem.” By introducing the ad-blocking tech to Chrome, Google hopes to wrestle control away from the likes of Adblock Plus, which charges fees for whitelisting ads from certain companies. Google itself is part of Adblock Plus developer Eyeo GmbH’s “Acceptable Ads” program.

EU ready to fine Google billions in shopping search antitrust case [Report] In one of three active cases, the company faces potential fines of up to $9B. Greg Sterling on June 2, 2017 at 10:12 am More After several months of silence, it appears that antitrust regulators in Europe are ready to fine Google for “abuse of market position” in shopping search — one of three active cases against the company. Reuters reported the news based on discussions with “two people familiar with the matter.” The article says the fine will likely be imposed by August and could amount to up to 10 percent of the company’s global revenues, which last year were roughly $90 billion. In other words, Google parent Alphabet faces exposure of $9 billion in this single matter. The fine has been anticipated for some time given Google’s inability to settle the case with EU regulators. The company has made several unsuccessful attempts — (e.g., “rival links“) — to settle with former European Commission competition czar Joaquín Almunia. Almunia’s successor, Margrethe Vestager, has taken a tougher line against Google. The EU’s formal “Statement of Objections” (antitrust charges) in the case focused on comparison shopping, but other areas of search would potentially be vulnerable to similar claims (e.g., local/maps). The following were some of the verbatim claims that appeared in the Statement of Objections: Google systematically positions and prominently displays its comparison shopping service in its general search results pages, irrespective of its merits. Google does not apply to its own comparison shopping service the system of penalties which it applies to other comparison shopping services on the basis of defined parameters, and which can lead to the lowering of the rank in which they appear in Google’s general search results pages. As a result of Google’s systematic favouring of its subsequent comparison shopping services “Google Product Search” and “Google Shopping”, both experienced higher rates of growth, to the detriment of rival comparison shopping services. Google has vigorously pushed back on the EU’s position, asserting that the evolution of its search results pages has been about improving quality and the user experience, which are beneficial to consumers: Google has always worked to improve its services, creating new ways to provide better answers and show more useful ads. We’ve taken seriously the concerns in the European Commission’s Statement of Objections (SO) that our innovations are anti-competitive. The response we filed today shows why we believe those allegations are incorrect, and why we believe that Google increases choice for European consumers and offers valuable opportunities for businesses of all sizes. Reuters is also reporting that the European Commission “will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices.” That would presumably involve a change in how shopping search results are presented. It’s not clear specifically what that would mean. Google can appeal to the European Court of Justice should the penalties be imposed. The two other active antitrust cases focus on exclusivity provisions in Google AdWords agreements and Android-OEM contracts and carry similar potential exposure for Google.

Google officially stops using DMOZ for source of search results snippets With that, you no longer need to worry about using the NOODP directive to prevent Google from using your DMOZ description. Barry Schwartz on June 2, 2017 at 10:15 am More Google has announced it will no longer use the Open Directory Project (DMOZ) title and descriptions as one of their sources of the search results snippets. On March 17, DMOZ officially shut down, and since the web directory is no longer being actively maintained, Google decided to stop using the DMOZ titles and descriptions in the Google search results. Since 2006 or so, Google would sometimes use the DMOZ description as a snippet in the Google results when it felt that description was more useful than what was available from the meta description or the site’s content. Google wrote “[W]ith DMOZ now closed, we’ve stopped using its listings for snippeting, so it’s a lot more important that webmasters provide good meta descriptions, if adding more content to the page is not an option.” That means that you no longer need to have the NOODP directive on your pages. That directive told Google to opt out of using the DMOZ description; with Google saying they no longer will use it, that directive is not needed anymore. Google strongly recommends you read this document to help Google pick the best title and description for your search result snippet going forward.

Gilbert Baker Google doodle celebrates LGBT-rights activists & creator of the iconic rainbow flag In honor of Gay Pride Month, Google has adorned its LGBT-related search results with rainbow flag imagery. Amy Gesenhues on June 2, 2017 at 10:17 am More Today’s Google doodle celebrates Gilbert Baker on what would have been the LGBT-rights activist’s 66th birthday. In 1978, Baker assembled a group of 30 people at San Francisco’s Gay Community Center to hand-dye and sew together more than 1,000 yards of cotton to create a rainbow flag that would be used for protests and marches. For nearly 40 years now, Baker’s creation has evolved into a symbol of pride and freedom for the global LGBTQA+ community. Google says Baker wanted to create something beautiful. “The rainbow is so perfect because it really fits our diversity in terms of race, gender, ages, all of those things. Plus, it’s a natural flag — it’s from the sky,” said Baker about his choice to go with a rainbow as a symbol of the LGBT community. Today’s doodle was designed by LGBT doodler Nate Swinehart. Google reports Swinehart worked with team members who felt a personal connection to the project and wanted to “… capture that same community spirit Baker treasured.” From the Google Doodle Blog: Together, the team decided the tribute would consist of a stop-motion animation of actual fabric strips coming together to create the flag. They made a trip to local San Franciscan fabric shops and filmed the doodle in a tiny kitchen only a few blocks from the same spot where Baker and his friends constructed that first flag in 1978. The doodle leads to a search for “Gilbert Baker” and includes the usual sharing icon to post the image on social feeds or send via email. Here’s today’s animated Gilbert Baker doodle that’s featured on Google’s US home page and a handful of its international sites: Google also shared the following two early concepts for the animated image: In addition to today’s doodle, Google is also celebrating Gay Pride Month by including rainbow flag imagery on LGBT-related search results. As part of their writeup on Gilbert Baker and the doodle they created in his honor, Google spoke with Baker’s sister, Ardonna Cook. She said her family is proud of her brother’s legacy of activism and artistry: “Gilbert led a bold and inspiring life by bringing The Rainbow Flag to life and it is that legacy which should guide us in respecting and celebrating diversity.” About The Author Amy Gesenhues Amy Gesenhues is Third Door Media's General Assignment Reporter, covering the latest news and updates for Search Engine Land and Marketing Land.

The internet giant's announcement comes as hundreds of millions of users have already installed blockers on their computers and phones to combat ads that track them and make browsing websites difficult, such as pop-up ads. These blockers threaten web publishers that rely on digital ads for revenue. Starting next year, Google's version will allow ads as long as publishers follow guidelines that ban certain types that consumers really hate. They includes pop-up ads, huge ads that do not go away when a user scrolls down a page, and videos that start playing automatically with the sound on. Google said the feature will be turned on by default, and users can turn it off. It will work on the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Google said that even ads it sells and manages will be blocked on websites that do not get rid of annoying types of ads. The company is also starting a programme that would help publishers deal with users who have downloaded popular ad blockers. Some individual websites have come up with their own counter-measures. Forbes.com, for example, will not let users read stories without disabling an ad blocker or logging in with Facebook or Google accounts, so the site can track them. Google would work with websites to set up messages telling users to disable blockers for the site or pay for a version of it with no ads. It will take a 10% cut of those payments. Facebook is trying to make links from inside its universe less spammy for users. It says it is trying to cut down on posts and ads in the news feed that lead to pages with "little substantive content" and "disruptive, shocking or malicious ads".

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd... Mainly I get approximately 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours constantly.And magnificent factor with this job is the fact that you can supervise time when you do the job and for just how long as you wish for and you attain a check week by week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now needa I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable. Lars Jeppesen Not available in my countries... Gen. Chang The point is to force the ad industry and websites to change the way they operate. Not reward them for more bad behavior. If it was not for the privacy intrusive models they use, there would not be as big a problem.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple All the news we expect from Apple's huge developers conference Daniel Howley Dan Howley June 2, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple CEO Tim Cook will be on hand for the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5. (Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP) Apple’s (AAPL) massive Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off Monday, June 5 at 1 p.m. E.T., and we’re expecting a host of new announcements. These announcements will give us a view into what the company has been working on over the past year, as well as what we can expect with its upcoming iPhone 8. Apple is known for using WWDC to showcase its newest software updates. That means we’ll likely see the latest versions of the company’s iOS for the iPhone and iPad, as well as macOS for Mac desktops and laptops. Apple should also announce improvements to its watchOS and tvOS systems, and could even roll out its very own Siri speaker to compete with the likes of Amazon’s (AMZN) Echo and Google’s (GOOGL, GOOG) Home. iOS 11 Apple regularly debuts the latest version of its iOS operating system at WWDC, and this year’s event should be no different. Interestingly, while hardware leaks are the norm for Apple’s devices now, we hardly see as many software leaks hit the web. That means we don’t know very much about iOS 11 quite yet. So far, the big rumors point to major updates to Apple’s Siri voice assistant, which first landed on the iPhone in 2011. While Siri has seen a slew of updates since then, it still can’t quite match the power of Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Assistant apps. Apple’s iOS 11 will bring updates to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and some hints as to what we might see in the iPhone 8. With iOS 11, Apple could change that by bringing Siri more in line with what modern voice assistants have to offer such as expanded voice capabilities and improved language understanding. According to The Verifier, Apple could also add group calling to its FaceTime app, which would bring it in line with Google’s Hangouts and Microsoft’s Skype offerings. Whatever updates we see for iOS 11, it’s important to keep on eye on even the smallest changes, as they could provide a hint of what the iPhone 8 has to offer. Siri speaker Outside of iOS 11, Apple’s biggest potential announcement at WWDC is the Siri speaker. There haven’t been any leaked images of the speaker, which would compete directly with Amazon’s Echo, Google’s Home and Microsoft’s (MSFT) upcoming Cortana-enabled offerings. MacRumors says that Apple device will likely include facial-recognition technology and run off of the company’s iOS operating system.Bloomberg reports that Apple has already begun manufacturing the speaker, which means it could go on sale in the relatively near future. It will be interesting to see if Apple is capable of producing a product as powerful as Amazon’s Echo, especially since the Echo allows you to purchase items directly through Amazon using only your voice. macOS The software behind Apple’s Mac laptops and desktops, macOS is also expected to see some improvements at WWD. Little is known about the next major update to macOS, though if Apple sticks to recent patterns, it will likely throw in more iOS compatibility features to ensure iPhone users and Mac users stay within Apple’s product ecosystem. watchOS and tvOS As with Apple’s macOS, it’s still not clear what updates are coming to watchOS and tvOS.As CNET notes, Apple could begin offering a glucose monitor for the Apple Watch that would help diabetics monitor their blood sugar levels.CNBC reported in March that Apple CEO Tim Cook was seen walking around the company’s campus with a device connected to his watch that monitored his glucose. MacBook updates and a new iPad These rumors are a bit of a stretch, as Apple doesn’t usually announce much hardware at WWDC: But the mill keeps pointing to the potential for updated MacBooks and a new iPad debuting at the big show. According to Bloomberg, Apple will roll out three new MacBooks including a new version of the super-slim MacBook with a more powerful Intel processor, an upgraded MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with a new CPU. Read More Apple’s insanely thin and light MacBook is rumored to be getting an update at WWDC. It sounds like these MacBooks will only get improved internals, so don’t expect them to sport any new designs. The new iPad, meanwhile, is said to sport a 10.5-inch display and offer stylus support.9to5Mac says the iPad will manage to pack its large screen into a body that’s not much larger than the current 9.7-inch iPad. We’ll be on the ground in San Jose, California, and in our New York offices covering the day’s events as they happen. And don’t forget to follow all of the news as it happens via our live blog.

IANS Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Got to know about Dharmendra's star status through Google: Australian actor Australian actor Travis Jeffery says he got to know about the stardom of Indian veteran actor Dharmendra through Google. The actor, who is working with the Indian cine icon in short film "Dream Catcher", added that he decided not to watch his films to avoid getting nervous in front of him. "I did Google his name. I found out that he was a legend. I thought that I will watch his films but then I thought it will make to nervous knowing how good he is,a Jeffery told IANS on Friday here. Jeffery, who also stars in "Pirates of the Caribbean - Salazar's Revenge", will be seen as love interest of actress Pooja Priyanka. The actor says Pooja talked about Dharmendra a lot and that made it "obvious how much of a superstar he was". The 20-minute film, which was shot in Delhi and the next schedule is expected to be in Mumbai, narrates a love story and puts the focus on the role technology plays in a relationship. It was Jeffery's first visit to the country. The actor says he was amazed by the dedication of Indian cast and crew. Talking about his experience, the 28-year-old said: "It was an honour and privilege to shoot in such a beautiful country. It was such an extraordinary experience...I am so looking forward to come back again." The actor, who has seen films like "Slumdog Millionaire" and aceThe Lunchbox", added: "I think Bollywood is a lot faster...I was amazed by hard working cast and crew." "Dream Catcher" is an Indo-Australian project, being made in collaboration with Australia-based producers Rishi Raj Films and Kinopticon Productions. Being helmed by Santoshh Shivamm, aceDream Catcher" is written by Rahul B. Seth. Shivamm is excited about his debut film. "This is my debut film and I have tried to make the vision betteraWe only had money to make a short film," Shivamm said. Seth feels Dharmendra's presence has put more value to the project. --IANS sug/tsb (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Bing have now shown their cards with image within image search. Not to be outdone by Google, Microsoft have attached the benefits of machine learning to their image search results. When searching the net most prefer Google, but, this has definitely added a bookmark in mind when we are looking at images. This added functionality will give consumers more control in finding what they want from an image alone. For example, see an item on TV that someone is wearing and you know you could pull it off easily? Now all you need do is find a screenshot of the scene and search within the image highlighting the item you want to purchase. With a little luck the correct item should now be shown beneath the original image as a clickable link.  Obviously this will not work perfectly every time but it can only get better. This is the thing with machine learning. The more people use it the more it learns. Even though this is not Google, it still has a very ‘Project Tango’ feel to it, as in, the machine knows what it is looking at. We tested it today and made a number of different searches. The most successful search was for ‘flea market’ As you can see below we just switched the capture box to a different area to focus on each separate item: 2. We also searched for a Micra engine image. We then chose to capture the air intake in the hopes it would show up a picture of the part or something similar. Unfortunately Bing sees this as an assault rifle scope, so definitely room for improvement. It will definitely be interesting to see how this one specific image changes its search results over time. How to try this out:   Search for flea market and hit enter Making sure you have Images selected: 2. Select the image.  3. Click the magnifying glass icon. 4. Now adjust the box to your chosen item. The search results below the image will change as you move over each item. Have fun teaching Bing machines!

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Internet Image Source: Shutterstock Google, the world’s biggest online advertising company, will start blocking online ads next year Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal June 2nd, 2017 at 12:03 PM Share Tweet In an effort to force publishers to rethink the way they deliver ads on their websites, Google will be introducing its own ad blocker in 2018. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is giving publishers six months to prepare for the new tool, which will block ads on sites with “bad advertising experiences” and will reportedly be turned on by default in both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Don't Miss: It’ll be a long time until the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot are priced this low again While we’ve known about the Google ad blocker since April, this week marks the first time that Google has confirmed the move. Sridhar Ramaswamy, SVP of ads and commerce, explained in a blog post on Thursday that “we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018.” Thankfully, before the ad blocker goes into effect, Google will give publishers the opportunity to use its new Ad Experience Report tool, which elucidates the differences between an acceptable experience and one that doesn’t conform to the Better Ads Standards. Once the publisher has determined which ads won’t fly under the new system, they can check this post for ads to use instead. This might sound troublesome for publishers who depend on ad revenue to keep their sites up and running, but considering the fact that 26% of US internet users already use third-party ad blockers, this could end up helping. Third-party ad blockers, like Adblock Plus, block each and every ad, regardless of how annoying or intrusive they are. Google’s ad blocker will only block ads when they don’t conform to the Better Ads Standards, which means that sites with tame ad experiences will be spared. Google is also introducing another tool called Funding Choices, which will allow publishers to “show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker, inviting them to either enable ads on their site, or pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor.” Tags: chrome, google View Comments Trending 1 Tech People are going to pay $880 for this ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ Galaxy S8, sadly 2 Tech Rumor claims Apple’s MacBook Air line is dead 3 Tech Foxconn insider drops avalanche of information about the iPhone 8, new MacBooks, Apple’s smart glasses and more 4 Tech New leak sheds light on Apple’s secretive ‘smart glasses’ project 5 Tech See how the HTC U11’s camera stacks up to every other flagship Picked For You Samsung’s about to launch a new version of the Galaxy S8 By Chris Smith 4 days ago Fresh leak sheds new light on the iPhone 8’s display By Yoni Heisler 2 days ago How the iPhone 8 will look next to the iPhone 7, the Google Pixel and other top phones By Yoni Heisler 3 days ago Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad

Gboard v6.3 enables search suggestions in the Google app and widget for some Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 9:32am PDTJun 1, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 77 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares159 Applications News Google dropped a new version of Gboard last night, which includes a number of cool improvements to search. Some people are reporting another interesting feature in the form of Google search suggestions int he Google app and widget. Not everyone seems to have this, though. On older versions of Gboard, the keyboard's suggestion bar disappears when doing a search. That's still what it looks like for myself and most other AP staff after the update to v6.3. However, we've heard from a not insignificant number of people who are seeing the suggestion bar. This appears when searching via the Google widget and within the Google app. It seems to work just like the suggestion bar elsewhere. Start typing, and the keyboard guesses what word you might want to use next based on your typing history and the power of Google's prediction engine. Just grab the new version of Gboard and open a search to see if you've got it. Download QR-Code Gboard - the Google Keyboard Developer: Google Inc.

Artem Russakovskii Yes https://plus.google.com/+ArtemRussakovskii/posts/aYxevnQNXK7 https://plus.google.com/+ArtemRussakovskii/posts/BsXuhKZQbmz F4LL0U7 I got that too, briefly. I think they accidentally pushed out the dogfood version. mike shwilly Somehow the suggestions/corrections bar doesn't even appear for me on menus like that. Anyone got a clue? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fcf5ae1af260f403d6fe67b4a16960601a0f678f624415845c966be49de6c152.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7db6affa5d2544f41d448de7188c46494be0ca138cb1088830fd557174531b65.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0729dbe9f8f2b6951428091c0dc20c66822aa0bd1fb3d8c8198fba4181bd896a.png Artem Russakovskii That's the mystery - I'm not seeing suggestions either, but many are. mike shwilly I think i had this problem since Nexus 5. It has always been really annoying. Suicide_Note Deftones are a terrible band. Hurricane Andrew I still do not see it on my S7 Edge. I wonder if launcher choice makes a difference. I use Action Launcher. Would be interesting to know what launcher people who are and are not seeing this are using. Yuri Vidal on my s7 it works. are you a beta tester? i also dont use touchwiz launcher. the suggestion bar works for me on chrome, and on google app too. jkl888 I see the suggestions on my phone Artem Russakovskii I'm on the Pixel Launcher, tried both Google app 7.2 and 7.3, and Gboard 6.2 and 6.3, and I don't have this. Reply and post your launcher, Google App version, and Gboard version, and whether you have suggestions or not. Armando Rodriguez Have you notice that the "short" height is shorter than previous versions? abqnm Are you on an S8 or G6? They tweaked some proportions on the odd aspect ratio devices. The S8 doesn't have the hugely tall spacebar anymore, which may be why it seems that way. If you're not on one of those I'm not sure as it seems the same to me. Armando Rodriguez Nexus 5 DPI at 420 Raz Have it. Nova Beta, GBoard 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, Google app 7.3.19.21.arm64. The new GBoard just asked for access to my SMS to improve the suggestions. Bruno Logerfo wait since when there's a dark theme for the google widget? João Ricardo He problaby has a theme kervation I am using a Google Pixel XL with the stock pixel launcher, running Google app version 7.3.19.21 & Google Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061. I have the suggestion bar for the Google app and also the Chrome beta browser and regular Chrome browser. I also have search suggestions show up when typing in the Google app. JATIN BANSAL I think this is also new. Earlier in dark themes, they used to have a white glow around emoji but now it is gone. I like it now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8bcc901c9f60b97c05dc467df6fa4838f96cabcfbf6421714f5ec7189958205.png roberto.elena I wished the keyboard had a dynamic theme that would change automatically based on the app being used, like the status bar does: Youtube = red, WhatsApp = green, Facebook = blue, etc. thegrau There's a third party keyboard that does exactly that. Can't remember the name, but I believe it's based on AOSP Yuri Vidal chroma keyboard Łukasz Ordon There is also Xposed module that can do that...

EmirSc minium has this. thecoolkid Thank god! I hated the glow, not very material design... Lexster Okay, but...when will they put a freaking space after punctuation? It's not that difficult, but after using Swiftkey, I really can't get used to having to put a space after punctuation. catalysto I would NOT want that. Don't need my OCD flaring up with unnecessary spaces. Though, sure, it should probably be an option. Lexster How are spaces after periods of sentences unnecessary? hype67 In acronyms, when the dot doesn't denote the end of a sentence. As decimals. Others situations I can't remember off the top of my head. Lexster USe acronyms with periods a lot, do you? I can't remember the last time I did. It's not generally required for acronyms. You put FBI, not F. B. I. But, yes, it's a little annoying with decimals, but that can generally be programmed to recognize if the space isn't needed. Swiftkey often does. It misses sometimes, sure, but usually works well. If a field needs an IP address, it usually knows this and doesn't put a space. And yes, it can be annoying with website names, but it's much easier to backspace every once in awhile than have to hit space after every single period or question mark. Łukasz Ordon Just press space twice :P It puts full stop AND a space after it... Lexster Yes, but I prefer having the space after punctuation. Doesn't require two taps of the space bar. And it only enters periods. Łukasz Ordon Oh well... You can't make everyone happy... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Typing URLs and email addresses is a giant pain in SwiftKey. catalysto When it's the last sentence. Lexster Okay? Well, it doesn't add a space until you type a letter, so if it's the last sentence, there wouldn't be a space unless you typed something else. catalysto A period does not always signify the end of a sentence though. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman So glad it doesn't do that. One of the worst things in SwiftKey. Typing URLs and email addresses was such a giant pain in the ass. Hitting space after I type a period isn't a big deal to me AT ALL. Especially since I'm used to typing on a keyboard anyway, so do it automatically. Lexster There some reason it can't be an option? Or do you think because you don't want it that no one should? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman You didn't indicate an option. An option might be okay, although I think it might break enough things as to cause them problems overall. Sometimes options that break the experience are left out to prevent frustration when users forget they're responsible for their own problem. ozzyager I do see suggestions when doing a search. I also recieved the dog bone version first, before being updated again shortly thereafter. Maybe just a coincidence? catalysto Same thing happened to me. It's still working after updating to the non-beta version, too. Though I'm in the beta program for Gboard, so maybe that has something to do with it? My version number is 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, in case anyone is curious. Łukasz Ordon That Gboard app version with dog paw should not be released publicly. It indicates 'dogfood' version (as googlers call it) which should be tested only inside Google. Dogfood is just debug version of normal app (don't quote me on that tho) ozzyager Correct. This is why I wondered if there was any connection between that version being released by accident to some, like myself, and only some seeing the suggestions when doing a search. Of course it might just be a server side update that is being tested, etc. Łukasz Ordon I've myself got dogfood version but shortly after (like 5 mins later) I've received another update with normal apk... Armv7 version btw :p roberto.elena It also gives suggestions in Chrome while in incognito mode. abqnm While that may be unwanted, it should be pointed out that it now gives suggestions in the Chrome address bar. Period. Previously it did not suggest anything at all in the Chrome address bar, incognito or no. I still don't have it in search though. It does work when typing to Assistant, but it may have done that previously. boop Can someone explain the nav bar in the second pic? Łukasz Ordon It's probably Pixel phone navbar... destinyhud pixel phone if u mean the down arrow then when u click a bar the left become a down arrow boop The color, I mean destinyhud thats probably Gboard's feature. maybe with 6.3 Hurricane Andrew Running Action Launcher 3, Google app version 7.3.19.21, Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061 and do not have the suggestions in the search app. Łukasz Ordon Talking about Google app itself... apparently, cards in Google Now feed have new design now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5fbd4b5888c4ad6d684f6ab3ba7589a3354607b05f565c0b7aed404237d8d8dc.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ed878edc7fa830f93bf49db1a7d5c8b4267ae6cada762eb9d0e723312cd72c5a.png Łukasz Ordon Aaaaand it's gone...

Teja The word prediction is the only thing I worry about. Swiftkey is way better than Gboard which made me to switch back to Swiftkey. Michael Oghia Does anyone else experience problems with the spell check feature? Sometimes I misspell a word, it tells me it's misspelled, but then doesn't offer any suggestions. It used to work better a few years ago (when it was still just keyboard or whatever it was called). Vratislav Jindra I would swear I had this yesterday. Today it disappeared.

However, Home was only available in the US at first. It came to the UK later, but America's neighbor to the north was left hanging. Not anymore—Google Home launches in Canada on June 26th. Home will understand both English (the kind with extra "ehs" and "sorrys," I guess) and Canadian French when it launches later this month. The feature set appears to be the same, so many smart home devices and services will work with Google Home out of the box. Pre-orders are live at the Google Store and Best Buy Canada. It looks like the price will be $179.99. It will be for sale at plenty of other retailers on launch day, including Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Staples, The Source, Telus, Visions, and Walmart.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Opinion ProBeat: Google’s Chrome ad blocker initiative makes Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla look incompetent Emil Protalinski@EPro June 2, 2017 10:30 AM Google yesterday confirmed that Chrome is getting a built-in ad blocker that will block all the ads on a site (including Google’s own ads) if just one ad doesn’t meet certain standards. That’s right: Google, the company that makes the majority of its money from advertising, is building an ad blocker. This alone is crazy. Google already has the world’s most popular browser and it’s plowing ahead building arguably the only feature that would really differentiate other browsers. I find it astounding that none of the other major browser makers managed to beat Google to the punch. There is still time for Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla to act. Google’s solution isn’t coming to Chrome until “early 2018,” a timeframe that could easily slip. Delivering an ad blocker directly in Safari, Edge, or Firefox this year could help these browsers in their fight with Chrome. And yet, I don’t expect any of these companies to do anything but eventually follow in Google’s footsteps. Apple moves way too slowly with Safari updates. Some have even gone as far to call Safari the new IE. Still, Apple loves playing up the security and privacy features of its macOS and iOS devices, slamming Google at every opportunity. It makes plenty of sense for Safari to have some sort of built-in ad blocker that not only protects users but also hurts Google’s bottom line. I also don’t really expect Microsoft will do anything in time, despite the rumor of a native ad blocker in Edge back in March 2016. The company has certainly sped up its browser development compared to the IE days, but Edge is still only updated twice a year along with Windows 10. And the features in this year’s second release, the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, have already been announced. Firefox Tracking Protection That leaves Mozilla, the only company I can feasibly see not only getting something ready in time, but making sure it’s superior to what Chrome will have. Firefox could indeed steal Chrome’s thunder with a native ad blocker. Like Google, Mozilla updates its browser every six weeks or so. The firm also likes to regularly point out it develops the only independent browser — meaning it’s not tied to a tech company that has priorities which often don’t align with the web. Furthermore, Firefox has already offered a feature called Tracking Protection since November 2015. Just like how Chrome’s ad blocker won’t block all ads (if a site doesn’t have any low-quality ads, they all get shown), Firefox’s Tracking Protection also lets certain ads through. With Tracking Protection turned on, Firefox blocks website elements (ads, analytics trackers, and social share buttons) that could track you while you’re surfing the web, meaning it’s similar to add-ons like Ghostery and Privacy Badger. The problem is that Mozilla only offers Tracking Protection in Firefox’s Private Browsing mode (akin to Chrome’s Incognito or Edge’s InPrivate). If Mozilla really wanted to one-up Google, it would bring Tracking Protection to the forefront of Firefox. In fact, Mozilla ran an experiment that enabled Tracking Protection outside of Private Browsing mode. While the company identified websites that didn’t function properly with the feature on, and identified domains which have been incorrectly classified as trackers, it ended the experiment and didn’t pull the trigger on bringing it to Firefox users. “Making Tracking Protection available in Firefox outside of Private Browsing is certainly under consideration,” a Mozilla spokesperson told me a few months ago. “However, there are some websites which do not function properly when trackers are blocked.” In other words, Mozilla is being a coward. Its reluctance and inaction have given Google the perfect opening to let Chrome further pound Firefox into the ground. The feature wouldn’t even have to be enabled by default; Firefox could simply inform users about Tracking Protection and let them easily turn it on or off. The last step would be proper marketing: Firefox takes your privacy so seriously that it blocks ads and trackers more thoroughly than the ad blocker only coming to Chrome next year. Unless Apple, Microsoft, or Mozilla act quickly, you can bet Chrome’s stranglehold on the browser market will tighten. ProBeat is a column in which Emil rants about whatever crosses him that week.

Now, Google is using your search data to reveal what words Americans are struggling to spell — just in time for National Spelling Bee week. Google shared America's most misspelled words on Twitter with a color map showing what residents of each state struggle with the most. Ironically, the map misspelled the word "ninety" with "nintey." The list is compiled based on the top searched "how to spell" words from January 1, 2017, to April 30, 2017, so it's an evolving and changing list. It is organized by how many letters are misspelled in each word. There are some interesting errors, like states who struggle to spell beautiful, liar, and twelve. Or Wisconsin, whose residents had issues spelling the name of their own state. Others are understandable, like Connecticut and West Virginia who searched the spelling for supercalifragilisticexpialidocious from Mary Poppins. (The real question is why?)
