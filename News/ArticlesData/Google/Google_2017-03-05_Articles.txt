Google’s smarter, A.I.-powered translation system expands to more languages Posted 13 hours ago by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Russian hackers reportedly extorting cash from liberal political groups Last fall, Google introduced a new system for machine-assisted language translations, Google Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT), which takes advantage of deep neural networks to translate entire sentences – not just phrases – for greatly improved translations. The company put the system to work in Google Translate for eight language pairs in November, and is today expanding support to three more: Russian, Hindi and Vietnamese. Neural Machine Translation went into action late last year with support for translating to and from English and French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. These represent the native languages of around one-third of the world’s population, covering more than 35% of all Google Translate queries, the company said at the time. Today’s news is also fairly significant in terms of scale, as in the U.S. alone, 1,292,448 people speak Vietnamese; another 836,171 speak Russian; and 586,173 speak Hindi, Google says, citing U.S. census data. And more languages will be added in weeks ahead, including Thai, which didn’t quite make today’s release. Google Translate serves over 500 million monthly users in need of 140 billion words per day, The New York Times reported in December. According to the report, Google’s switch to this A.I.-powered machine translation system is expected to complete this year. Neural translation is a huge leap over prior translation systems, as it’s able to take advantage of the progress made in the machine learning field to make translations more accurate, and sound more like the way people speak the language. What makes the difference is that the system doesn’t translate each part of a sentence piece by piece, but looks at the sentence as a whole. This helps the system figure out the broader context and the most relevant translation. It then rearranges and adjusts the sentence using proper grammar. In addition, the Neural Machine Translation system learns over time and improves, resulting in better and more natural translations the longer it works. The new translations powered by this system will go live across the Google Translate platform, starting today. This includes online at translate.google.com, through Google search and the Google Search app, and in the Google Translate apps for iOS and Android. The translations will soon be made available for automatic page translations in Google Chrome. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Translate Description Google Translate is a beta service provided by Google Inc. to translate a section of text, or a webpage, into another language.

This feature pulls a special block of text from popular web pages that have the answer to the question Google thinks you’re asking. The problem with this approach? It doesn’t filter out fake news sites. A new report shows just how bad Google is at filtering through these fake news sites with their snippets feature, so much so that it seems as though this issue is just as big as Facebook’s problem of letting an algorithm decide what news should be trending instead of human eyes. A university lecturer in the United States was recently taken aback when his students asked him if any presidents were members of the Ku Klux Klan. When the professor stated that there weren’t any presidential members of the KKK, students whipped out their phones in an attempt to refute their professor with fake news offered by Google Snippets. In fact, Google’s snippets feature reported that five presidents were members of the KKK, including Warren Harding, Woodrow Wilson, William McKinley, and Harry Truman. The snippet comes from a website called The Trent Online, which bills itself as the leading internet newspaper in Nigeria. That article further sources an article that comes from ilovebackpeople.net. This issue highlights a real problem with Google Home and Amazon Alexa, especially if they’re relying on unvetted informational snippets that are chosen by an algorithm. In fact, this is no different than Facebook’s fake news issue after the company fired all of its human editors in order to rely on an algorithm to display trending news. Don’t believe me? If you have a Google Home, ask it “Who is the king of the United States?” and check out the source article. local_offer    Google   Google Home   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (39) stars Further Reading Rumor says Pixel 2 won't have a headphone jack Google Play Store celebrates its 5th birthday The March security update is released for the Verizon Pixel Google's budget Pixel 2 may come to Android One HP and Google announce a new Chromebook for students stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertOnePlus 5 rumors closeOnePlus 5 may have curved display, 256GB of storage, and a 23MP camera A couple of new rumors out of Korea shed some light on the OnePlus 5.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 March 2017 by Military News Tableau works with Google Cloud Platform to Help Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine Improve Patient Care SEATTLE, March 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — The Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine (CCPM), a partnership among the University of Colorado Denver, UCHealth, Children’s Hospital Colorado, and CU Medicine, is using Tableau Software (NYSE: DATA), a global leader in visual analytics, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to analyze patient data to predict disease risk and develop targeted treatments based on an individual’s health history in support of breakthrough research projects. This research requires examining the genetic makeup and health history of thousands of patients to reveal patterns showing how people with particular genetic profiles tend to get certain diseases and whether they could benefit from specific treatments. To address those concerns, CCPM relies on Health Data Compass, CCPM’s enterprise health data warehouse. Health Data Compass integrates patient genomic data from CCPM and electronic health records from UCHealth, Children’s Hospital Colorado, and CU Medicine, including external records such as insurance claims, public health records, and environmental data. Eventually, it will encompass data from social media, wearable devices, and more. Health Data Compass previously used a traditional on-premises system to store and analyze data. But that approach proved costly to maintain and didn’t scale for the center’s current analytics needs, let alone their projected growth. Following a comprehensive six-month pilot project, Health Data Compass migrated to the GCP and Tableau, which together can handle massive data sets and powerful visual data analyses, while costing less and allowing for easy scalability as CCPM grows. Significant to CCPM’s decision was the ability of GCP, including Google BigQuery, to support HIPAA compliance per CCPM’s requirements. „We take our responsibility to protect patient data very seriously. The Google Cloud Platform provides significant advantages in data security over on-premises systems and helps us achieve HIPAA compliance,” said Michael Ames, Associate Director for Health Data Compass and Director of Enterprise Architecture for CCPM. Drilling down into genomic data Health Data Compass uploads data from multiple sources to Google Cloud Storage, which is less expensive and more scalable than Health Data Compass’s on-site storage. From Google Cloud Storage, data is routed to Google Genomics and Google BigQuery, where a wide range of analytics is performed. Google BigQuery provided an unexpected benefit for one of Health Data Compass’s key services: probabilistic record linkage algorithms. Information about patients comes from multiple sources, so Health Data Compass needs to ensure that records aren’t duplicated. For example, it must determine whether ‚Bobby Peterson’ treated as a youth at Children’s Hospital Colorado is the same as ‚Roberta Peterson’ treated as an adult years later at UCHealth. Compass holds records for nearly 6 million patients, so this algorithm requires tremendous processing power. Health Data Compass’s original on-premises infrastructure took eight hours to complete the job. With Google BigQuery, it is completed in 15 minutes at a fraction of the cost. Health Data Compass is developing tools to drill deeper into this data to quickly find answers. It uses Tableau’s self-service visual analytics platform with optimized connectivity to Google BigQuery for live analysis directly against the data in Google BigQuery. Tableau enables role-based dashboards for clinicians and researchers who are not data scientists to get useful insights from the data in a governed and secure data environment. Health Data Compass also deployed their Tableau implementation in the cloud on Google Compute Engine. „Self-service data discovery and visual analytics from Tableau with Google BigQuery will enable researchers and clinicians to use Health Data Compass to quickly identify and understand patterns in genomic data to improve quality, lower costs, and accelerate delivering care, for superior patient outcomes. This is the future now,” said Andy De, Senior Industry Director, Healthcare and Life Sciences at Tableau Software. Faster and better answers at less cost Health Data Compass successfully completed its comprehensive pilot project using Google Cloud Platform and expects to capture considerable benefits when it goes into full production this year. Analysts can perform queries much faster with Google BigQuery than with the previous solution. As a result, they can iterate alternative data queries with clinicians and researchers to extract complex concepts. In addition, Health Data Compass expects to dramatically cut operating costs including software, hardware, maintenance and support. With Google Cloud Platform, Health Data Compass scales quickly without having to add hardware. It can also more easily integrate data from new sources, because it doesn’t have to contend with complex issues such as opening up ports and firewalls and setting up FTP servers. In addition to the hospitals that University of Colorado partners with, such as UCHealth and Children’s Hospital Colorado, Health Data Compass also pulls in state public health department data, weather data, insurance claims data, and data from other sources. „Combining genomics with clinical data and the exploding diversity of other personal data to provide individualized patient care is the frontier of medicine and research. Google Cloud Platform and Tableau provide us with the big data processing and analytics power we need to give researchers tools to improve healthcare for millions of people,” says Ames.

(Beck Diefenbach/Reuters) Listen 6:31 more stories from this episode Bunny Museum owners have so much stuff they're hopping to a bigger space Why Google Home is spreading a fake story about Barack Obama plotting a coup For sale: Grey Gardens. Film's caretaker takes us inside $20M mansion Full Episode When Twitter user Rory Cellan-Jones asked Google Home if Barack Obama is planning a coup, the digital assistant device responded by detailing a bogus conspiracy theory about the former president plotting a communist scheme to take over the government.  "According to details exposed in Western Centre for Journalism's exclusive video, not only could Obama be in bed with the communist Chinese, but Obama may in fact be planning a communist coup d'état at the end of his term in 2016," the smart home device's robotic voice explained, though it stumbled over the word "d'etat." And here's what happens if you ask Google Home "is Obama planning a coup?" pic.twitter.com/MzmZqGOOal— @ruskin147 But this outlandish response isn't restricted to Google Home. Rather, it highlights a problem with how the search engine responds to queries in the form of "featured snippets" — short, direct answers highlighted at the top of its search results.  AS IT HAPPENS: Police want access to Amazon Echo in murder case Google offers a glimpse into its fight against fake news "In recent years, Google has been moving toward just trying to give people an answer when they ask a question rather than being like a research tool and showing them a list of places where they could find the answer," Adrianne Jeffries, senior editor of online publication The Outline, told As It Happens guest host Susan Bonner. "Unfortunately, one of the ways Google has been able to provide a lot of answers this way is because it's doing it algorithmically and sourcing them from third-party webpages, and sometimes those webpages are crazy conspiracy theory websites." Google Home draws on these snippets to answer questions. For example, when Guardian reporter Danny Sullivan asked Home if women are evil, it summarized misogynist propaganda and told him: "Every woman has some degree of prostitute in her. Every woman has a little evil in her." Google Home giving that horrible answer to "are women evil" on Friday. Good article on issues; I'll have more later https://t.co/EUtrx4ZFul pic.twitter.com/Ec8mEqx8Am— @dannysullivan Jeffries reported on the phenomenon in her article "Google's featured snippets are worse than fake news," which tells the story of an Ohio history professor who was taken aback when one of his students announced — incorrectly — to the class that three former U.S. presidents were members of the Ku Klux Klan.  For evidence, he held up the Google search result on his phone. "It was a learning experience for his students to find out that Google, which is this very trusted source of information, was coming up with a totally bogus answer. And that answer's still live," Jeffries said. Here's what happens when Google relies on unvetted third-party websites to generate its snippets. (CBC) The snippets are right more often than they're wrong. Many of them are fact-based answers to simple questions from Google's own knowledge base — things such as currency conversions, time zones, capital cities and dates.  Here is an example of Google's featured snippet doing exactly what it's supposed to do. (CBC) But for less obvious queries, it summarizes its top search results.  For the most part, Jeffries says the problem is "self-correcting." The longer the tool is live, the more data the algorithm gathers, and the better it gets at generating helpful responses.  Unregulated 'internet of things' industry puts us all at risk For new smart-home gadgets, the spectre of insecurity looms Google has already moved to correct some of the more outrageous examples listed above. The company has apologized for the Obama coup kerfuffle. In a statement to the Telegraph newspaper, it said: "Search isn't perfect and it's hard to get it right all of the time." Despite what your Google Home may have told you, former U.S. president Barack Obama is not 'in bed with the communist Chinese.' (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) But Jeffries said the company risks eroding people's trust by rolling out its featured snippets tool "way too fast." "The problem with this is Google is spreading this misinformation, even if it's temporary. Even if Google gets that speed of correction time down from five days to five minutes, it still looks like Google, which people trust more than the traditional media and more than social media and their friends. It still looks like Google is saying this is the one true answer," she said. Here's a fun game: Find your own terrible Google featured snippet! https://t.co/IVWjNvTTsB pic.twitter.com/ybaFil3Gjz— @adrjeffries "I think that the company has a responsibility to the truth and it has a responsibility uphold the values that it has done a pretty good job of upholding in the past." For the folks doing the Googling, Jeffries has some simple advice: "Always look at where the source is coming from."

Existence, But Save All Your Data  David Nield Mar 7, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  facebook fieldguide google instagram privacy snapchat social networking twitter web yahoo Share Sick of Snapchat? Tired of Twitter? Fed up with Facebook? This is a great time to completely eradicate yourself from social media. All of these online services let you scrub out your accounts if you want a cleaner, leaner life online. Even better, plenty of them let you export your data for safekeeping before you do. So you can always remember that time The Rock answered your desperate tweets or your roommate plastered your Facebook wall with photos of your dog. Here's how you can delete, and back up, accounts from most major social media services. Facebook Image: Screenshot Remember when Facebook was fun? It was around 2008. In any case, if you've had enough of advertisements and badly thought-out politics, you don't have to stick around — the option to sort-of delete your Facebook can be found on the settings page on the web. Click Security, then Edit next to Deactivate your account, then click the link that appears. That deactivates your account — it's not actually gone and you can jump back in to the social maelstrom at any time. If you do want to get rid of your account permanently, with no chance of coming back, then you actually need to head to this page and click Delete my account. You get a short grace period during which you can change your mind, then everything is scheduled to be wiped within 90 days. Facebook makes it very easy to get a copy of all your social networking activity before you go though. Head to the online settings page, then click General and Download a copy of your Facebook data (a password prompt appears to make sure you really are who you say you are). You get posts, photos, chat conversations and more, all in a handy HTML format you can view in your browser. Google Image: Screenshot Goodbye Google! If you've decided the time is right to sever all connections with Mountain View, you need to go to your account page on the web then click Delete your account or services. The next option lets you delete some parts of your Google account separately — like your Gmail or YouTube accounts — or get rid of everything at once. As you might expect, you need to enter your password along the way. If you choose to delete everything, you'll be given a list of all the stuff that's going to be wiped — from images in Google Photos to playlists in Google Play Music — and you can then click Delete account to confirm your choice. On each of these screens, you'll also see a link to download your data. Those data dump tools can also be accessed from the main account page by clicking Personal info & privacy then scrolling down to Download your data and selecting Create archive. The next screen lets you select which bits of data you want saving (Google Calendar appointments? Blogger posts?) and you can then choose a file archive type and delivery method (it can even be saved straight to your Google Drive if you decide to keep that one bit of Google). Twitter Image: Screenshot If you've had just about as much of Twitter as you can take, quitting the service is fairly straightforward. To get your data out before you get out, go to Twitter settings in your web browser, click Account and then Request your archive. When it's ready to download, you'll get an email alert — all your tweets are saved in a nicely formatted HTML archive so you can relive the good tweeting times. Still keen on leaving? Click Deactivate my account then confirm your choice on the next screen — this actually means delete, not just deactivate, but you do get a grace period of 30 days during which you can log back into your account and carry on as normal. If you're part of Twitter royalty and verified, you get 12 whole months to change your mind. Instagram Image: Screenshot To delete Instagram you need to head this page. Tell Instagram why you're going ("it's not you, it's me" maybe), enter your password, then click Permanently delete my account. If that's too much, you can temporarily disable your account by opening up your profile settings from the web then clicking Temporarily disable my account. There's no time limit to this, so you can pick up again whenever you like. As for getting your photos and videos out of Instagram, there's no easy, integrated "export all" option you can make use of. You either need to have been saving your Instagrams to your phone all along (it's the Save Original Photos switch in settings) or trust your account data to a third-party service like Instaport. Snapchat Image: Screenshot By its very nature, Snapchat doesn't leave much of a digital trail, though the app has become more inclined towards permanence in recent years. You can save your photos and videos to your phone (via Memories in the app settings), but you need to do this in advance — you can't bring your old snaps back. The option to delete your account isn't actually available in the app, so you need to head to accounts.snapchat.com in a web browser, log in, and then click Delete my account. Snapchat will check that you really, really want to go, and then you're done. If you change your mind, you've got 30 days to reactivate it. Yahoo Image: Screenshot If Yahoo's woes have convinced you that enough is enough as far as the once-great internet service goes, then you need to log into your account inside a web browser and then visit this special page — you'll be warned about the consequences of deleting your account (which... er... deletes all your data), then you need to click Terminate this Account to confirm. Unfortunately there's no quick and easy way to get all of your data out of Yahoo, but we're talking primarily emails here, which can be accessed via IMAP. If you plug the Yahoo Mail settings into your email client of choice, whether Gmail or Outlook, you can get all of your messages moved out and saved before pulling the plug on Yahoo. Comments ManualFunky @rickmyrundies Mar 7, 2017, 12:50pm After years of Facebook, I deleted it on New Years Eve, 2016 After using Twitter for 1 day, I deleted it 4 years ago I have Snapchat purely for my 4yo and 6yo kids to get a kick out of taking photos I'm actually quite fond of Instagram after using it since closing Facebook and will probably keep it until it turns to shite. Nothing quite beats seeing nothing but guitars, metal bands, The Rock, Schwarzenegger, and the lives of people I actually give a damn about, rather than the 650 odd people I was "Friends" with on Crackbook... Reply 0 TUALMASOK Guest Mar 7, 2017, 2:20pm You know you can remove those "friends", and even reduce the amount of content you see from you remaining "friends"? I went through a massive cull a few years back and stuck to the rules that I wanted less that 100 friends who had to be people that I actually interact with IRL, or whose input I actually value. It's great! No more clutter, and even when there is (mass posting sisters, fml) I just choose the option to not have their shite posted on my wall. I can go weeks without an annoying notification or message, and friend requests died down after people realised I didn't want to see them on my social media.

If you plug the Yahoo Mail settings into your email client of choice, whether Gmail or Outlook, you can get all of your messages moved out and saved before pulling the plug on Yahoo. Yep, I did this when I began hosting my own email instead; 1. Via Thunderbird, I recreated the folder structure 2. cut/pasted all correspondences 3. activated forwarder and delete on source, and 4. nuked the Yahoo account, sorted. Cunningly and covertly, Yahoo have disabled forwarding in light of the bad publicity/hacking scandals, creating a mass exodus of users. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

"Chairman Pai had a warm meeting with President Trump this afternoon, in which they reconnected for the first time since Chairman Pai was elevated to head the FCC," an agency spokesman said in a statement on Monday afternoon. "No proceedings pending at the FCC were discussed." Pai, who has served on the commission since 2012, has worked quickly to try to undo many of the regulations pushed through under his Democratic predecessor. He has dropped nine companies from a subsidy program for internet access, suspended an FCC probe into free-data programs offered by providers like Verizon and AT&T and retracted a report on a program that provides broadband access to schools and libraries.

Jamison and Eisenach have railed against net neutrality. Eisenach has referred to the rules as tools of "crony capitalism." Read more here.

TRUMP TRAVEL BAN, TAKE TWO: Airbnb and Uber called out the Trump administration on Monday over the president's new executive order temporarily banning people from six Muslim-majority nations from entering the country. "Barring people from entering our country because of where they're from was wrong the first time around - still wrong," Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky wrote on Twitter. "Our sentiment has not changed: President Trump's immigration ban is unjust and wrong," added an Uber spokesperson in a statement to The Hill. "We will continue to stand up for those in the Uber community affected." "Lyft stands firmly against this order," the ride-hailing company's CEO Logan Green said in a statement. "We will continue to speak out and take action when the values of our community are put at risk. [Lyft President] John [Zimmer] and I are meeting with the Executive Director of the ACLU on Wednesday to discuss how we can further support their efforts." President Trump's new executive order bans the entry of foreign nationals from Iran, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. It comes after implementation of the previous order, which blocked entry from all of the above nations plus Iraq, was halted by a federal court. For more on Airbnb and Uber's reaction, click here.

TECH GROUP TOUTS IMMIGRATION REFORM: The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) also slammed the new version of President Trump's travel ban, and used the opportunity to push for immigration reform, a long sought objective for technology companies. The trade association, which is backed by companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google, called for a comprehensive solution to "our broken immigration system." "We strongly encourage the president and the Congress to seize the opportunity to create an immigration system that we can all be proud of," wrote ITI President Dean Garfield. "One that recognizes the innovative contributions and diverse talents of people of all backgrounds so entrepreneurs and business leaders can grow their companies and create jobs for Americans." AIRBNB TOUTS DIVERSITY NUMBERS: Airbnb released a report Monday highlighting how women around the world are using the home-sharing service. According to the company, 55 percent of its hosts are women, and they have earned more than $10 billion. The report was released ahead of International Women's Day, which is on Thursday, and was meant to highlight how the company can help fight the wage gap between women and men. GOOGLE UNDER FIRE IN TURKEY: Google is now facing regulatory scrutiny in Turkey, after officials launched an antitrust investigation into the company's Android mobile operating system on Monday. The investigation is focused on software packaged within Android and was prompted by a complaint from Google's Russian competitor, Yandex, reports The New York Times. The company says that Google's software bundle in Android creates an unfair advantage against its competitors. The Turkish Competition Authority, which is conducting the investigation, initially declined Yandex's complaint but changed tack on Monday. Read more here.

According to Google Home, the company’s Amazon Echo-like smart speaker, Barack Obama is planning a coup d’etat in the US and all Republicans are Nazis. SearchEngineLand editor Danny Sullivan noted that when you typed a question into Google Search about whether the former president was planning a coup, the top answer was: “According to details exposed in Western Centre for Journalism’s exclusive video, not only could Obama be in bed with the communist Chinese, but Obama may in fact be planning a communist coup d’état at the end of his term in 2016!” Google’s virtual assistant gave the same response, and you don’t even get the option to hear other answers. BBC tech correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones posted a video to Twitter showing Google Home warning of Obama’s secret intentions. And here's what happens if you ask Google Home "is Obama planning a coup?" pic.twitter.com/MzmZqGOOal — Rory Cellan-Jones (@ruskin147) March 5, 2017 Google’s fake replies weren’t restricted to right-wing conspiracy theories; Sullivan asked Google Home if Republicans were fascists, to which he was told “Yes, Republicans equal Nazis.” Google Home: "Yes, republicans = nazis" pic.twitter.com/7HVQjyjbEq — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) March 5, 2017 The problem comes from Google’s “featured Snippets,” which are algorithmically generated quick answers sourced from web pages that rank highly in search results – so they aren’t curated, obviously. It’s been known to surface bizarre answers to questions such as “how many presidents were in the KKK?” (at least five, according to Google), “what happened to the dinosaurs?” (“they are used more than anything else to indoctrinate children and adults in the idea of millions of years of earth history,”), and “are women evil?” (it seemed to suggest so). Google Home giving that horrible answer to "are women evil" on Friday. Good article on issues; I'll have more later https://t.co/EUtrx4ZFul pic.twitter.com/Ec8mEqx8Am — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) December 4, 2016 Google says it removes these sort of answers when alerted to them. A company spokesperson gave the following statement: Featured Snippets in Search provide an automatic and algorithmic match to a given search query, and the content comes from third-party sites. Unfortunately, there are instances when we feature a site with inappropriate or misleading content. When we are alerted to a Featured Snippet that violates our policies, we work quickly to remove them, which we have done in this instance. We apologize for any offense this may have caused.

In celebration of the anniversary, Google has published a list of the best-selling games, apps, albums, singles, movies and books in the US since the store’s launch. The results probably won’t be much of a surprise to those that have kept up with pop culture in recent years but here they are nevertheless: Top Installed Games (does not include those pre-installed on Android devices) Candy Crush Saga Subway Surfers Temple Run 2 Despicable Me Clash of Clans Top Installed Apps (does not include those pre-installed on Android devices) Facebook Facebook Messenger Pandora Radio Instagram Snapchat Top Selling Albums Adele - 25 Eminem - The Marshall Mathers LP2 (Deluxe) Taylor Swift - 1989 Drake - If You're Reading This It's Too Late Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly Top Selling Songs Ed Sheeran - Thinking Out Loud Lorde - Royals Taylor Swift - Blank Space Mark Ronson feat.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Make Google Home Play a Sound When You Say “OK, Google” Google Home is usually pretty good at recognizing when you’re talking to it, but sometimes it fails. By default, Google Home will show colorful lights whenever you activate it, but if you want it to make a sound too, you can do so. Those lights are handy, but you can’t see them from every angle, or if you’re busy looking at something else. If you’re not paying attention, you can recite a lengthy voice command to an empty room before you realize Google isn’t listening.  In the Home app, you can enable a setting that will make a dinging noise whenever you say “Ok, Google” so you know for sure whether or not Google’s listening. To turn this feature on, open the Home app on your phone or tablet and tap the devices button in the top-right corner. Scroll to your Google Home in the device list and tap the three-dot menu button, then tap Settings.   Scroll down and tap Accessibility. Here, you’ll see two buttons. You can enable “Start of request,” “End of request,” or both. Whichever you prefer. Now, whenever you say “Ok, Google,” you should hear a dinging sound from Google Home. Just like every other device that runs Google Assistant. JOIN THE DISCUSSION Tweet Eric Ravenscraft covers smarthome tech for How-To Geek.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google sorry after Google Home spews Obama conspiracy theory By Levi Sumagaysay / March 6, 2017 at 12:52 PM Fake news has been tossed around a lot lately — including by Google Home. Google Home, the smart speaker that talks to its users, recently spit out conspiracy theories about President Obama, as evidenced in a BBC video. Google Home works like Amazon’s Echo. You talk to the machine and tell it to do things for you, such as play music. Or you ask it a question, and it reads aloud what it finds on Google. Over the weekend, it responded to “is Obama planning a coup” in the following way: “According to details exposed in Western Centre for Journalism’s exclusive video, not only could Obama be in bed with the communist Chinese, but Obama may in fact be planning a communist coup d’état at the end of his term in 2016!” OK. “We apologize for any offense this may have caused,” a Google spokeswoman said in an emailed response to SiliconBeat Monday. “Featured Snippets in Search provide an automatic and algorithmic match to a given search query, and the content comes from third-party sites. Unfortunately, there are instances when we feature a site with inappropriate or misleading content.” In other words, Google is still struggling with its fake-news problem. This news about Google Home is just the latest cringe-worthy article about it. For example, a few months ago, academics expressed alarm about a report that Google’s search autocomplete feature was being gamed by the right wing. Also, Google has promised to try to fight fake news by starving its purveyors of ad revenue, but in December a media watchdog reported that the company hasn’t been doing a good job of it. And the fake news about Obama wasn’t the only thing Google search was spewing out. Other documented examples include Google search snippets, drawn from so-called news sites, that claimed President Warren Harding was a member of the KKK, or that Obama was king of the United States. The Google spokeswoman said the company removed the “featured snippet” that Google Home recited after it was alerted about it. “We feature a ‘feedback’ link directly under Featured Snippets so users can flag content for us to review and potentially remove,” she said. Google isn’t alone in battling the scourge of fake news, of course. The issue got a lot of attention after the election of Donald Trump, and Facebook got its share of the criticism. Now, Facebook is beginning to mark some news as “disputed.”   Photo: Google Home, left, and Amazon Echo. Google Home was recorded as having regurgitated false information about former President Barack Obama.

Technology Alphabet Holds Lead In Artificial Intelligence; Facebook Lags Google parent Alphabet appears to be making more headway in artificial intelligence than its rivals. (Google) BRIAN DEAGON 3/06/2017 Reprints While Amazon.com (AMZN) was the first to introduce a voice-activated digital assistant with an internet connection and artificial intelligence, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is in a much stronger position for market leadership, while Facebook (FB) is struggling, says a report by Edison Investment Research. "Artificial intelligence appears at last to be coming of age," wrote Richard Windsor, analyst at Edison Investment Research, in a recent 51-page report on the subject. Amazon took a big step in bringing artificial intelligence into the masses two years ago with the introduction of Echo. The multifunctional, voice-activated speaker system is voiced by Alexa. Ask Alexa a question and she'll try to find you an answer, with the support of AI technology. The device can also be used to manage and monitor home utilities. Alphabet responded to Amazon with Google Home, another voice-activated digital assistant with artificial intelligence. Market trackers estimate that Amazon has sold more than 6 million Echo devices at the end of 2016, compared with 500,000 for Google Home, which was introduced in November amid fierce competition with Apple (AAPL), Amazon and Facebook. All four companies are working on artificial intelligence and digital assistants in various formats. The prospect of making money off artificial intelligence has all the tech giants investing heavily in the space, Windsor wrote. But understanding how AI works and how best to use it for revenue generation remains at an early stage, with none of the big challenges close to being solved, he says. "Amazon's Alexa has been first to market via its home speaker but is very far from offering a useful and intuitive user experience," Windsor wrote. With more competitors coming into the market at lower prices, Windsor sees Echo struggling for penetration in homes that do not use Amazon Prime. The advantage in artificial-intelligence applications, for now, goes to the search-engine providers, wrote Windsor in a research report. They are Alphabet, Chinese search leader Baidu (BIDU) and Russian search king Yandex (YNDX). Not only do Alphabet, Baidu and Yandex collect vast amounts of data that can be used to enhance AI services, but they have also been working on this the longest by far, Windsor said. "It is really only the search engines that are advanced enough in their understanding of the data that are able to start using it to enhance their services," Windsor wrote. IBD'S TAKE: Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are strengthening their connection to customers with mobile and in-home devices infused with advanced speech recognition and artificial intelligence. The devices could evolve into the next major disruption in computing and put the smart home on a fast track. In the AI arena, Alphabet, Baidu and Yandex are followed by Microsoft (MSFT) with its Cortana platform and Apple with its Siri platform, with Facebook falling behind. "AI remains the Achilles' heel of Facebook." Windsor wrote. "Facebook is the laggard, with one of the weakest positions in AI globally." Microsoft has deep roots in artificial intelligence with its Cortana platform, available on mobile devices and PCs. While Microsoft did not announce a personal digital assistant, it gave a partial view of the device, which looks similar to Echo. In the video a person addresses the device as "Cortana" before asking questions. Apple's voice-activated Siri program is available on the iPhone and iPad, but Apple has not yet signaled when it might introduce an in-home digital assistant. Amazon stock slipped 0.4% to 846.61 at the close. Alphabet was off 0.2% to 847.27. And Facebook was up 0.2% to 137.42. Apple dipped 0.3% to 139.34.

The investigation is focused on software packaged within Android and was prompted by a complaint from Google’s Russian competitor, Yandex, reports The New York Times. The company says that Google’s software bundle in Android creates an unfair advantage against its competitors. The Turkish Competition Authority, who is conducting the investigation, initially declined Yandex’s complaint but changed tack on Monday. ADVERTISEMENT Google’s scrutiny in Turkey is the latest in series of antitrust international probes of the American company. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company is currently facing three competition charges in Europe and was found to be in violation of antitrust laws in Russia. The investigation opened by Turkish competition officials bears similarity to the inquiry by the European Commission regarding Google potentially abusing its dominant position with Android, which runs on 75 percent of smartphones worldwide, to unfairly gain market share. Google has sharply rejected these claims, arguing that European regulators have not properly factored in considerations like the fragmentation of Android as it gets modified by developers and not including Apple as a competitor in their antitrust analysis of Google’s mobile operating system. “Open-source platforms are fragile,” a Google senior vice president wrote in November. “They survive and grow by balancing the needs of all participants, including users and developers. The Commission’s approach would upset this balance, and send an unintended signal favouring closed over open platforms.” Google did not immediately return The Hill’s request for comment on Monday.   View the discussion thread.

Name: Subject: Message: From Android Market to Google Play: a brief history of the Play Store Features Newsby John Callaham11 hours ago 3 417 2 Five years ago today, on March 6, 2012, Google made a huge change to Android that consolidated all of the operating system’s content stores into one platform; the Google Play Store. Previously, Android users had to get apps, games, movies and TV shows from the Android Market, music from Google Music and electronic books from the Google eBookstore. Google’s decision to merge all of these stores into one portal made the lives of all Android device owners much easier, and it likely helped to expand the reach of the OS in general. With today’s fifth anniversary, we decided to take a very brief look at the history of Android Market and Google Play, along with some of the major changes and improvements that have been made over the years. See also: The best Android apps of 2017 5 days ago Pre-Google Play: 2008 to 2012 Android Market launched in 2008 as a way for users to download apps and games for the new Android operating system. The store added support for paid apps in 2009 in the US and UK, and expanded to more international markets in 2010. It also launched the Google eBookstore that same year. In 2011, Google Music launched, and the Android Market added support for both books and movie rentals in the US that same year. Obviously, having multiple stores on Android could cause some confusion, which is likely why Google decided to merge all of its stores into Google Play five years ago today. At the time of the announcement, Google made a big deal of the fact that all the purchases via Google Play would be cloud-based, meaning users would not have to worry about losing a downloaded file ever again; they could simply download them again from the store if they needed to switch phones or tablets, or if they needed to do a full refresh of the phone. At the launch of Google Play in March 2012, the store had 450,000 Android apps and games to download. Obviously, that number has gone much higher in the past five years. Google Play also served as the place to purchase Google’s various Nexus hardware devices. Improvements and changes: 2012-2015 The company was not going to sit around and rest on its laurels following the launch of Google Play though. In August of 2012, it revealed plans to offer physical Google Play gift cards in the US, allowing people who did not own a credit or debit card a way to purchase apps, games and other content from the store. Then in May 2014, the Google Play Store made some changes, which included adding some additional information on each app listing, including ratings and file size. In July, Google Play got a major redesign, incorporating the company’s then new Material Design language. Google also confirmed that summer that since the Google Play launch two year earlier, it had become the company’s biggest source of revenue outside its internet ad business. The number of apps in Google Play had also exploded up to 1.5 million, compared to the 1.2 million apps for iOS users in Apple’s App Store. In March 2015, Google decided to separate the sale of its hardware devices out of the Google Play Store and into its own Google Store division. That meant that Google Play was just for downloading and purchasing digital content only. In October 2015, the Google Play Store got another big redesign, with curved content section buttons, large images for featured products on top and creating two sections, Apps & Games (self explanatory) and Entertainment (movies, TV shows, books, magazines and music). Later the Entertainment section would be renamed as “Movies, Music, Books”. The current storefront: 2015-2017 All of the icons for the Google Play suite of apps got redesigned in April 2016 so that they would share the same triangle look as the main Google Play app. In May, the company revealed that the Google Play Store, and its Android apps, would become available on a number of Chromebooks running on Chrome OS. Earlier this year, Google said that all Chromebooks that were released in 2017 would have access to Google Play. Google also continues to evolve the Play Store user interface. In November, it added a Trending section that includes the current hot topics in the entertainment industry, and the appropriate content download links. Google also announced plans in 2016 to crack down on apps that were using fraudulent means to pump up both their download numbers and their reviews. Today and tomorrow Today, the Google Play Store is pretty much the center of the universe for Android owners who want to purchase apps or other content. While there are some third-party app stores also available for Android, most notably the Amazon Appstore, none of them have the sheer amount of content that Google Play has. Indeed, one third-party estimate from research firm AppBrain claims that there are now over 2.77 million apps and games to download from Google Play. That’s not even counting the number of movies, TV shows, music, ebooks and magazines that are also available on the store. At the same time, some analysts and experts are questioning how long traditional app stores like Google Play will continue to stay active. We have seen the rise of voice-commanded digital assistants like Siri, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant in the past couple of years. It’s more than possible that some apps in the Google Play store could be replaced by the advanced functions of AI assistants. We’re also seeing a renewed push towards progressive web apps. Finally, improvements in cloud technology could eventually position streaming apps and services as reasonable substitutes for traditional apps. And who knows what other advancements could change the mobile landscape in the future. However, that is not likely to happen for a long time to come. For right now, the Android operating system continues to add new smartphones and tablets, all of which have Google Play access. Also, other platforms and products like Android Wear watches, Android Auto and Android TV use versions of Google Play as well. Indeed, in Google’s own blog post celebrating the 5th anniversary of Google Play, it stated that it now has 1 billion active users in 190 countries. Google has also posted a special page to celebrate the 5th anniversary by listing the top 5 downloads from Google Play in the US in apps, games, movies, music, music albums and books. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that the most downloaded movie from Google Play is the Seth Rogan-James Franco 2014 North Korean comedy The Interview.

In January, 9to5Google‘s Stephen Hall published a report that stated Google planned to release two Pixel devices in 2017. One device, the Pixel 2, would have been the successor to the current Pixel and Pixel XL and would have potentially added features like waterproofing. The other device, codenamed “Pixel 2B,” would have been a mid-range take on Google’s flagship Android smartphone. However, comments by Google’s Rick Osterloh, made during a closed doors meeting with select members of the tech media, suggested Google no longer planned to release a less expensive Pixel variant. When asked about the possibility of a mid-range Pixel, Osterlod said, “Pixel stays premium.” He also confirmed the company plans to release a new Pixel smartphone later this year. Following Osterloh’s comments, the source 9to5Google spoke to in its original article contacted the publication to provide further context on the information they provided back in January. “You should interpret “Budget Pixel” as a device that is being developed by the same team working on the Pixel 2, that is aimed at being released in emerging markets,” said the source. “This could mean Android One, this could mean something entirely different. My knowledge of this device is that: a.) it’s being developed alongside the Pixel 2 and b.) will not be sold in the US (assuming that it leaves the prototype stages).” Based on those comments, it seems Canadian consumers will only have one high-end option when it comes the Pixel 2. In any case, we’ll likely learn more about Google’s 2017 smartphone plans in the weeks and months to come.

In its quest to index the internet, Google's search engine has come across quite a few questionable websites. That content occasionally shows up at the top of the search results as an embarrassing example of how its algorithms can't always discern the truth. Google "Why are fire trucks red?" for instance, and the top suggested search result is a snippet of a Monty Python joke involving measurements, ships, and Queen Elizabeth. Although it's a relatively benign joke, it's ultimately unhelpful. And as The Outline points out, some results are far more concerning: Google's algorithms have promoted websites that claim several presidents were Ku Klux Klan members or that Barack Obama intended to divide America so he could declare "martial war." Google's systems have for years automatically selected the top answers to some commonly searched-for subjects based on several factors, including a "Knowledge Graph," and displayed them in a conspicuous box at the top of search results pages. That practice came under renewed criticism on Monday following The Outline's investigation of its inaccuracies, and amid the fake news stories that have come to the forefront of the national political debate in recent months. As Recode notes, the inaccurate results are popping up via the company's Google Home device, which makes for some funny video footage but is, again, unhelpful. And here's what happens if you ask Google Home "is Obama planning a coup?" pic.twitter.com/MzmZqGOOal — Rory Cellan-Jones (@ruskin147) March 5, 2017 For its part, Google believes that the algorithmically selected answers—which it calls "featured snippets"—are a net positive for its users, although the company notes they aren't perfect.

When we are alerted to a Featured Snippet that violates our policies, we work quickly to remove them, which we have done in this instance. We apologize for any offense this may have caused." So it appears that Google is hoping people in search of knowledge in a hurry will nevertheless take the time to do their own vetting of snippets by telling Google about incorrect results (there is a link to provide feedback at the bottom of every snippet). That's good practice for anything you do on the internet: despite Google's reputation for quality, its search engine is ultimately a catalog of other people's content. And while many searchers take Google's featured results at face value, you can't discount the fact that there are plenty of Monty Python fans who just want a quick refresher on the fire engine joke, in addition to people who are genuinely wondering why fire trucks are red. Right now, it appears that Google's snippets are having a hard time telling the difference. Back to top Previous : Commenting on a News Article?

Google isn't coming, though, and other telecom companies want a piece of the action. (Benoit Felten/Creative Commons) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 06, 2017 at 1:05 PM, updated March 06, 2017 at 3:31 PM comments Oregon lawmakers may kill a tax break just two years after they voted unanimously to create it. That's because the intended beneficiary, Google Fiber, has backed out of plans to serve the Portland area. The proposed reversal has drawn pushback from other tech and telecom companies that say they invested in their Oregon networks in anticipation of the same tax discount the state offered to Google. A repeal now would qualify as bait-and-switch, they complain. "In our opinion this represents nothing other than bad faith on the part of the Legislature," said Brant Wolf, vice president of the Oregon Telecommunications Association, at a hearing of the House Revenue Committee late last month. The issue originates in 2015, when the state Legislature approved a bill exempting internet service providers from an unusual Oregon property tax - provided those companies offer online connections of roughly 1 gigabit per second. Lawmakers had acted at the behest of Google Fiber, which said it would not offer service in Portland if it were subject to the tax. Last year, though, Google Fiber scuttled those plans. The company apparently decided that stringing high-speed fiber-optic cables through neighborhoods was too expensive. So Google is exploring wireless service instead in several parts of the country - though apparently not in Portland. Meanwhile, Comcast and Frontier Communications each applied to take advantage of Oregon's tax break - based on very limited gigabit offerings. Neither won approval from the Department of Revenue, but Comcast is challenging the ruling and will soon roll out a new gigabit service that would almost certainly qualify. Frontier says it will file for the tax exemption in November. So lawmakers are rethinking their approach. House Bill 2770 would repeal the 2015 gigabit tax break outright, while House Bill 2063 would set a minimum investment threshold to establish eligibility for the tax break, and a maximum price for the internet service. (Lawmakers have not yet suggested dollar amounts.) The city of Portland, which campaigned for the tax break in 2015, now says it wants it repealed. Portland says advancing technology has brought down the cost of deploying high-speed internet service to the point where a tax break is no longer needed to finance it. Wendy Johnson, from the League of Oregon Cities, testified recently before a House committee that internet service providers are adding gigabit service in Oregon and other states without the benefit of any new tax breaks. "Companies are expanding already," Johnson testified. "It's just not the service that we anticipated this exemption was needed for." The exemption applies to the unusual way Oregon assesses the value of cable TV and internet networks. Known as "central assessment," the practice taxes companies' intangible assets, such as the value of their brands. Oregon local governments want to hold onto tax revenue worth several million dollars a year. But telecom companies say they planned their investments in anticipation of saving that money. Frontier spent $2 million on upgrades in Washington County in anticipation of the tax break according to the Wolf, from the telecom association. Taking away the tax break now, he said, would have a "chilling effect on any future investment they might choose to make in this state." The gigabit tax break has been fraught from the beginning. Google Fiber said language in the original legislation accidently excluded the company, prompting lawmakers to write a new bill. Then last year, legislators said they were appalled to see Comcast and Frontier applying for the tax break without evidence of additional investment in their Oregon networks. At a hearing last month, Oregon Rep. Rob Nosse, D-Portland, claimed he was unaware of the gigabit tax break when he joined the rest of the Legislature in voting for it in 2015. "I've got to be honest with you," Nosse said during the Revenue Committee hearing. "I don't remember this gigabyte exemption in the bill, actually. If I'd been paying slightly better attention I might have voted differently on it, actually." House Revenue Committee Chairman Rep. Phil Barnhart told last month's hearing that he's unpersuaded by telecom companies' testimony that they need the tax breaks to keep investing in Oregon. "The issue here is the richness of the tax break and the need for it," said Barnhart, D-Springfield. "I expect all businesses who have enjoyed a tax break of any kind to claim it's valuable and necessary. What we need, though, is data that establishes that and so far we haven't received any." Update: This article has been updated to clarify that while the Department of Revenue rejected Comcast and Frontier's applications for the tax exemption, each company still hopes to receive the tax break. Comcast is challenging its denial and Frontier hopes to win sign-off from Revenue this fall. -- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699 Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Legal Notices Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 Oregon Live LLC.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach OnePlus 3 spooky Halloween wallpapers. Facebook/OnePlus Previous 1 of 2 Next OnePlus is gradually becoming a formidable name in the mobile phone industry with its affordable but capable handsets. The Chinese phone maker’s former flagship, the OnePlus 3, is the practical consumer’s dream device with its superb specs and incredible cameras. See how the OnePlus 3 fares against one of Android’s upstarts, the Google Pixel XL, when it comes to camera quality. Google Pixel XL – Camera specs and features The Pixel XL isn’t named as such for no reason. Google developed its first “official” smartphone with the intention of capturing the hearts of photographers. The Pixel XL quickly launches, shoots, enhances and saves images without wasting too many resources. The Google Pixel XL furnishes a 12.3 MP primary camera with f/2.0 lens. The back camera includes features like electronic image stabilisation (EIS), phase detection and laser autofocus, and dual-LED (dual tone) flash. Resulting images are in depth with well-saturated colours and aptly controlled noise. The Pixel XL has no problem producing high resolution 4K Ultra HD videos at 30 frames per second, first-rate quality 720p slow motion videos at frames per second and Full HD videos at 30, 60 and 120 frames per second options. The Pixel XL has an 8 MP f/2.4 secondary camera that produces the best selfies according to GSMArena. Details are abundant while skin tones and overall colours are very pleasing and well preserved. Dynamic range is also considerably great while noise is kept in check whenever present. OnePlus 3 – Camera specs and features The OnePlus 3 furnishes a 16 MP main shooter with a f/2.0 aperture. It also has phase detection autofocus, LED flash, geo-tagging, panorama and HDR. It utilises optical images stabilisation (OIS) instead EIS. The former OnePlus flagship’s rear camera is able to produce 720p, 1080p and 4K videos at 30 frames per second, but can only afford to record 720p slow motion videos at 120 frames per second. The OnePlus 3 camera is consistent and reliable in almost any setup and hardly requires more than one shot to capture a perfect photo. The smartphone provides tons of details while also keeping the noise levels balanced. Colours are sufficiently well-adjusted with hints of warm tint from time to time. The 8 MP front-facing camera of the OnePlus 3 that likewise comes with f/2.0 lens is also outstanding and is able to produce unexpectedly comprehensive pictures.

Name: Subject: Message: Samsung’s browser now live on Play Store, works with Pixel phones Newsby Brian Reigh12 hours ago 44 1002 36 From the very beginning, Samsung and its TouchWiz have had its own apps for everything: its own calendar, its own email app, its own browser, and even its own app store. Some have survived to this day, and one of them is the Samsung Internet browser. Indeed, I have two browsers on my S7, just as I did on my S6, and the S5 before that and so on. Now, Samsung has released a beta version of that browser, and it’s compatible with certain “Galaxy and Nexus phones.” And yes, that includes the Google Pixel as well. See also: (Update: Video added) This is Samsung’s Good Lock UI for Android May 19, 2016 If you have a Nexus device or a Pixel phone and for some odd reason you’ve been wanting to try out Samsung’s web browser, this is your chance: the South Korean electronics giant has released a beta version of the app, and it’s now free to download from the Play Store. Curiously, Samsung notes, “Officially supported devices are all Samsung Galaxy and Google Nexus phones with Android 5.0 and above.” But to clarify, it looks like that sentence encompasses Google’s newest smartphone duo as well since it runs perfectly fine on Pixel devices. But to clarify, it looks like that sentence encompasses Google’s newest smartphone duo as well since it runs perfectly fine on Pixel devices. There are a few additional features here that are not found in the stable release: there’s now an indicator for Progressive Web Apps, an integrated QR code reader much like Chrome, and Physical Web support. It supports the Payment Request API, so you can make online transactions using Samsung Pay within the browser. In terms of entertainment, you can view 360-degree videos without a VR device, and it has a pop-up player similar to the Picture-In-Picture mode found on iOS. If you are a thrifty shopper, it can even automatically compare prices to Amazon when shopping online. The beta version is based on Chromium 51, and although you may not be able to download it directly from the Play Store depending on where you are, here is the APK file just in case you are curious to give it a try.

How we hijacked Google’s SEO guide search rankings Contributor Dan Sharp shares an experiment in which his company was able to hijack rankings -- from Google itself. See what they learned in the process. Dan Sharp on March 6, 2017 at 2:14 pm More I wanted to share some notes on an experiment my agency performed recently, which resulted in Google believing our website was the canonical version of their own search engine optimization starter guide PDF — and ranking us in place of their own content for “search engine optimization” and thousands of other phrases. We perform many tests internally, both for our SEO Spider software and as an agency for clients. This particular experiment was purely for fun to highlight the issue we discovered, without the intention of hurting anyone, or indeed for any profit. We have now ended the experiment and removed the content. Background We had previously been in touch with Google after noticing some strange behavior in the search engine results. While their SEO starter guide PDF was ranking for relevant terms like “SEO” and “google SEO guide,” something wasn’t quite right…. @JohnMu Hey John, the G SEO starter guide not ranking or indexed. Replaced by another site. This highlight issue with 302s? :-) pic.twitter.com/I5M4VLFe9D — Dan Sharp (@screamingfrog) November 7, 2016 For the searches we performed, the listing for the starter guide PDF would appear, but it would link to various other websites that had uploaded it rather than to Google’s own website. So Google wasn’t ranking its own page for some reason; other websites appeared instead, using Google’s content. Here’s a view of some of the sites ranking for it in the UK. Each site appeared to knock the other out of the search results as Google changed which one it believed was the canonical version. We decided to look into why Google’s page wasn’t being indexed and other pages were seemingly showing in its place. We noticed Google appeared to be using a 302 temporary redirect on their search engine optimization starter guide, which is hosted on a separate domain. The 302 redirect should mean the original URL on google.com was indexed, rather than the target URL hosted on static.googleusercontent.com. However, neither URL was indexed, and they appeared to be struggling to understand the canonical and index their original content and URL. Google was not using “noindex,” nothing was blocked via robots.txt, other content was indexed on the subdomain, and they didn’t appear to have any conflicting directives with canonicals or anything else on the page, or within the HTTP header. Google has said that PageRank flows the same regardless of whether it’s a 302 temporary redirect or 301 permanent redirect — it’s really a matter of which URL they index and show in the search results. So in theory, the original URL should have been indexed and ranking, but this wasn’t the case. While each type of redirect should pass PageRank in a similar way, Gary Illyes has said that 301s help with canonicalization. @AndyNRodgers redirects pass same, but 301 helps with canonicalization @JohnMu — Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) August 5, 2016 We knew from previous experiments that identical content can be hijacked, but generally by more authoritative websites. Google’s SEO starter guide has about 2,100 linking root domains to the original URL and another 485 to the redirect target (HTTP/HTTPS protocols combined), so it’s a very powerful page with lots of visibility. The starter guide is also on Google.com, which has a huge amount of reputation. The final target was on a separate domain, though. Obviously, the Screaming Frog website is not as authoritative as Google, but far less authoritative websites had already replaced them previously, due to the issues described above. The experiment We decided to run a short-term experiment and simply upload Google’s SEO starter guide to our domain. We then got it indexed via Google Search Console and forgot about it. A week later, we noticed we had hijacked Google’s own rankings (and any previous hijackers, due to our higher “authority”), as their algorithm seemingly believed we were now the canonical source of their own content. Our URL would return under a info: and cache: query for either of Google’s URLs. We had hijacked the hijackers — and Google. Even though we are a UK site, we jumped into 4th position for “search engine optimization” and the top 10 for “SEO” in the USA — from outside the top 50. The PDF ranked for “Google SEO,” “Google SEO guide,” “www google com” and every other phrase that Google’s content should be visible for. The PDF ranked for loads of other brand type queries in the UK and the US, which we can see courtesy of SEMrush (US specifically in the screen shot). And Sistrix highlighted the sudden “new” keywords we were now appearing for organically: Google Search Console recorded nearly 800K impressions for the PDF specifically for a period of four days. This experiment received a lot of attention when we tweeted it. So, we kept an eye on it over the following days to see if Google made any changes to correct indexing, canonicalization and ranking. Around 48 hours later, we noticed that Google’s guide started ranking and was clearly now indexed (and would appear under a site: query), when previously it wouldn’t have returned a result. We then noticed Google had added an HTTP canonical to their PDF to the original URL, which helped get it indexed. However, we were still appearing as the canonical under an info: query and ranking for their queries. This meant both guides were now ranking in the search results, often with our site above Google’s own.   We were expecting this to change — for Google to become the canonical again and our page to drop out of the rankings. Up to five days later, we were still there, alongside Google in the search results for thousands of search queries. Then, our PDF disappeared from the search results, and we ended the experiment fairly swiftly. Closing thoughts First of all, we don’t recommend messing with other people’s content. This is not a viable strategy or tactic for gaining higher rankings, merely an unusual and interesting case study. It can be very difficult to draw conclusions, as we can’t always be sure what other factors or unknowns might be in play. While we have plenty of theories and thoughts internally, we’ll end on three closing points. 1. 302 redirect not (fully) to blame While we initially believed the 302 redirect might be the root cause, I know Google is adamant that there are no issues using 302 redirects. We believe there are some contributory reasons around how the files are hosted. We found a few other quirks around URLs changing over time (based upon values supplied in the Accept-Language header) and canonicalization on HTTPS incorrectly just for good measure. 2. Use canonicals It’s very wise to use canonicals to help with indexation. As soon as Google updated the PDF’s HTTP canonicals to a single URL, it was immediately indexed. Using a crawler, you can scan your site for missing canonical link elements or canonical links in your HTTP header. For PDFs and docs, you can easily set an HTTP canonical using .htaccess, for example. 3. Although rare, hijacking can occur A page’s rankings can be hijacked by another domain that uses identical content under specific circumstances, such as problems with indexation or being a more authoritative source. This is generally unlikely, but perhaps there are some things that Google can still improve in ranking the original source.

If I sat down the I don't look holidays I was I was told that it's called an adult playground. All the Oklahoma we have a little column is called playground on the property not sexual at all at thankfully it was a ritual toys involved I think. Well you think Jessica actually do it looks like a big I don't know. It looks like something you would find it like Google or you're at Yahoo!. Apple apple gadgets like the F Khaled a big dry erase board their gas spunky little light. You know our chairs futuristic share is GAAP and I got bleacher seating which mean out of foam out is what you do in the bleachers ethic I think he's small you sit and you think you can vote really cool ideas generated a meeting with the two people. A three if some people sick you've got to the abort their down and that's sort of what the other thing is this your portable table there. Or people don't know there's broad and other all the space over at the other end of or basketball hoop. I'm sure what those holes I feel a little to whom we are gonna play against somebody. Adult plate where we were trying to work Sarah because she absolutely that and it is like a there's like EEI's version of comfort station. Well that was like you know comfort room my editors of Rahm work if you do so there's like a bull. We'll call a bullpen we're all salespeople are yet Garrard all the walls and it's all open now bear digital deaths that rise up so people can work they want.

Let's go to your evaluations coming up soon and M can't do his phenomenal. Efforts are raising our peoples lengthened because you have that little play area that people are going to be more part yeah that's that's the idea you let us police line and a odd because like I believe that bill are relatively immobile object would say about some type of set up that they have dominated that lowering guest. And not a little silly areas that he's -- but he put this on the Red Sox got the beds in the got ahold was the beauty rest beds at camp because there some sort of I am someone that -- or something bad paper here the bet here is we have thank you obviously he's spent with all of this is it that Richard did it also they did part of many out there it's a commercial publicity shattered refine advantage is everywhere why not like units were sold a record on the disc so you need a funky C a funky bleacher seat needed to be more creative I beat that's pretty. So here's you some alcohol. Can I could be more creative there OK I really do my best thinking in my private bath from here in the building. But I only know with private bath for the private bath. You're really you know nobody knows about where there's been. And one actor wore to know what you're up to you right at that does it isn't it about philosopher I. I I actually walked farther terror alert as the terrorists are a big garage and lawlessness and a lot of moto auto workers of America when you know it shares are down the right no no no no doubt about it yeah and is it just on theirs and otherwise I was I had never mind and so that is my it's my leg OK in my hotel bathroom no no no. Private. I can't hear you can't seem to think it's at a bar of ours come industry and bars Conan does not bore you are as a bar guys dance but bar and urges are. Being adult playground stripping out because 1 o'clock tomorrow on the adult play world different where are often hear that my victory gonna whatever it's such richer game one tomorrow. So we could actually hit the board tomorrow at 1 o'clock guys worked really now just provide us with a ride home will be good. The early days with an accent steak soft and her love Iran's brits are ultra radical I've coached I paternity hole like you jury duty and trying to work and how this is even better way to let. If you know that you couldn't move to two I don't like the big payoff at the game that the people. I doubt six going to be Tim Tim never count him never and that Tomas. Via the eighteen. Thrusts. Yeah can I did so you'd have to move out. I'm going to get institute of enrollees have from one to do you know the bill now we are receiving Venezuelan. Theories that she acknowledged. Well. On honey opportunity Williams are all about what is Washington play. And it's East Coast they keep movement of him again now Obama and still around so nobody should. None of the right you'll recognize anybody in the first and second right there for a new Erica zero argument pitch. I wanted to present and into fuel. Fine okay it's always great NBA first cannot go to an Alley correct Miller on second. People who do want prayer to Allah is great just to go home. I honestly I'd watch that earned his eleven million of them really at some point and let you know listen we got to pay anyways notes is trying to. Total call at this point time just have a good offseason have a good life really what the official money out just give us an address that. To send their check or give us a direct deposit and he just looks like he's just can't wait for October. My point is a place. I mean and an eleven million dollars in two woody joining trying to aged to pass the time so we hope so and I haven't. I've been to come out swinging one year of one it's like all the sudden it's back not just mentally don't just let you know what I am tired. Of sucking and not just collect a check but I am I would never that was one of the best hitters in the National League like two and a half years. Gonna get back to that I'm gonna show you should global luxury tax and put in the roster. Screw everything else because I take what there's a scenario they actually need him at first base but still. Just some in boot camp he does limit ad but yet the star and pop business tomorrow Alley or whatever why individual but looks to me like he's just happy to Google evident on all of its. Not for him is going to be a little ashamed involvement I mean you sound out words like something it was a it was amazing about it when you picked. Do you think that he was one of the better clutch hit in the league history and he had one foot injury. And obviously got his money yeah is that his cut because of his clutch and he's one foot injury and a guy can hit mine leaks at all. What you don't have to say that it would hoping happened right music in play much in a while is really handling this well. An eternity that containment. And following is a lot to prove because that trip they sent them Tripoli say you know what this is what's best for me and I got to what a great attitude and Taylor's fine. Put that around. He's not sure enough light bright is as good up enough maybe he's given his identity to this is not life. OK so eventually you would get used to but hell Missoula the million dollar yearly tear down in triple Lakehurst instantly turn fifty to see him you know pop music night what. Happened. Unless how. Happened giving a crap. That's what Harry Reid I think that's what it is and how how little how do you fall you think you're at least break a wrist it was his ankle for God's sakes hottest hitter like that to stop getting completely wild and failed eating a big hit an 811 million he's made it a little Elliott. It is likely to what did Chan or to the I ball. Is that all nervous about lightning back I thought I had no idea and always liked at a Tripoli is shall the ballpark delightful third say we earlier music and our. Barack what are and it's in some young did not leave them be the only could be here to get expert and let's not exit costs are straight this thing out it exceed its that indicates music. Does he coach is it mental or feel like doing anything that you could they not socialist gonna write an article I know he's not playing well but he felt he's responsible for this guy this guy and that guy. Between he nobody talking about between him there was a route down the hill wasn't there. I don't want to two months ago Watergate called up and all the luxury tax big foot putt second larger payroll and then some teams in Major League yeah Greg we're going to save a million dollar point two million dollar and 211 you know unbelievable. So we left here on Friday and we thought it was doom and gloom with David Price this is it out for the season and Tommy John surgery it's gonna screw him up for next season. Because it's a year to get back and then by that time he's gonna have the opt elbow why would he opt out wind. He's looking at thirty million dollars it doesn't make any sense that it suddenly weak we. We left and about two hours later on I'm reading all the stuff. It never mind. It and it as George just sit there. It could be the actual opposite happened you. Most of time gears second opinion you hear elbow you hear it ECB AG news stories why am I skeptical about all all of this right now why am I getting the feeling. When he comes out in says David Price said that he's like different physically unlike other human beings or something. That would incite more pliable so maybe that's ordered another sit at the elbow he's iconic album no differently on elbow so it's not a. Very unique I heard that before we knew enough. Johnson will be on the search through. As you know wasn't. Won't do when it's cool to hear from those two guys. Does he got Angelo as you get something that almost a guy that's the guys how to get me innings he had in his career without an elbow issue. That's about a double. Evan disabling of these days again but it go to throw. What he's thrown it the quality the velocity the amount and to have. You know at this stage. You look at it sets impressive wasn't there some question last year the fastballs down a couple miles from town location within his own was down but I mean it was this I don't know. Not clearly itching to they have been coming out of a better at least double play any paid Evans music rights are now get hurt it's announced Johansson is she flowers to. Scott flower that's what happens. See it as an athlete issue. Consolidate. I. We do like it's only good thing in the windows good for right well. Venus and honestly I don't get them now there is ours come in and out of the money gets them you don't get these geeky looking people with little pencil. For Connecticut resident hip hop crowd is huge blow missing that part lies and can you giggle grabber ask officials and they don't question. At a strip club is strictly. A big you get what you did because they they only the rights to. Do his thing he she wants. Seem happy birthday or their overpriced right now. Happy weight loss to you that we have flattened at a show you used to be that sort of facts are so the and what we value and we know suspicious though than. That was cut so another note up to us from now if he's noticed that the and we thought what timetable is seven to ten days now that he's just thrown that out. Did you get an amount. He's gonna throw bullpen a month from now. That's this time he's used 22 weeks off. And it's going to be 4560. Feet on flat ground ninety feet black crowd 120 feet lack round. Now is gonna take a bullpen session at which is a picture of what you shut your program Downey revamp it you start from zero. It's gonna take a month just the toll bullpen. Lisa seven to ten days that I'm not out there in ten days and sure that's gonna be the next story if I'm now yeah five days I'm sure that'll be the next story as well. He lives right I was worried about that's. But here's the thing yeah I learned and don't put a day on it that we could have easily frightened last year. Don't put a timetable on it don't say anything but he's when he in the back. He's very consumed with. Think I think he's actually very consumed with the median Boston yes and people lost or trolling on Twitter whatever it might be right in just the way he deals with the media. Seen in person. He he's very into it and he's got to go you might say he's not agree that not a lead and I liked. Why make it worse who put a timetable was it him or was it I hate aren't you young well what are. Up or down down for weeks it's and its. Last year with robberies. Johnson apparently. Don't matter to H medicated and it is why they don't see a pattern here in Spain each day goes. That's right that's my point. You used a lesson by now like you're putting. And steadily and having David Price beyond mentally nutty about depending on top and worrying about what people are gonna say about because he's got back in time. How you do with solid and don't put a timetable at all on. Once you get me back when he's back. Boy look at a map get a good you have got to go prodigal we were probably we don't expect a guy that they thought the old ray Charles de and it has always surprised patriots philosophy. Don't put that to be its most you know here's the thing it's not the featured a lot would be it's like every team's philosophy. This still leaves in just carefree with timetables and injured reports that one when a guy's gonna be back. You don't do woman he favors. Because CBC's Quebec in three days three days of the reporters there why isn't what I -- back I don't know what I thought is now trying but there's a lack what I think is that it has not changed here. Then he had discomfort. In the noble and four. And it felt different than the discomfort. That he had felt in the past try that has changed or stiffness. Yes get to that hasn't changed. Now no but he says that you went three days without India inflammatory medication anything you know treatment. They already feels a lot better. Well that's great pit stop thrown local baseball right now if you. That's on Medicare well we don't know anything. And Carson Smith. A year ago it's pretty much now. He they shut him down in camp said the same thing he got an MRI. They say it is no structural damage to his UCL a which is the nerve that causes of malignant that causes Tommy John no damage whatsoever. Innovate setbacks come back and amount Boston month and a half later atomic. Don't know anything with David for about a month month and a half two months. Well right now they get five guys hopefully they'll stay healthy that break camp. And yet he just plod along and got a 55456. Week trial for the bottom three guys. Very throws the ball well Rodriguez was the xxx. Yes it sure is being reported right now maybe because people wanna look at it optimistically like there's nothing to see here and he's fine now we found out it unique Al. Any program. I'm near you I'm would you like I I think this would appear more this one bears watching it bears watching that just too much there because out of out of an. And even price talked about it. Everything. That everything you're hoping to hear. There's what they said they said everything they give you all the great news best case scenario is this that's exactly what the doctors told him. Like everything it wasn't you don't need surgery there's a short time table as far as when he you can return there's not a lot of rehab there's no injections. Normally the guy you know there's some inflammation there let's at least that lets objective was some core zone to get the swelling out of there and and see how you go. I don't know if that happened. Everything you want to hear talk like they're making it up. The progression of its main water on a day to day basis as we. Really really good and that's who. Forty hours. Mostly. It's time for. When nothing was as much as some reports Lou to. Where it. Nothing to see here nothing got cut the hullabaloo methane if it can also alarm does anybody believe he's gonna start the season. I would say no no I'm 80 no no well I don't know why does not leaving us at the home opener. That's going to be its first bullpen right. In my mind I think you're right. As far as a timetable goes forget about being ready for opening the first time he takes the mound. You know this particular time to warm it was in the but it doesn't do. But certain. I don't think it's four. No longer than change yours. Aren't gonna enlist and an average person again. That doesn't get federal and after Drexel says he doesn't unaudited Karstens to me it's like a Tommy John it's it's fastball. Velocity command. And soul. That's what he got destroyed last year my mind on his fastball. You know within the strike Sony won it over strike you're happy -- for strike ought to happen it was a bomb you wanna throw it out and happy to happen it was a bomb. Give a moment he's ever given up in Iran as fastball for the most part. Lost confidence in that pitch within games within at bats. Seoul with this injury. There is eager gain confidence in his fastballs gonna be more effective. That's owls opened for this year now at this it's just wait and see. Because that's the pitch. When he dominating games you go back and look that was changeup dominant. Changeup he got a lot of strikeouts breaking ball got a lot of strikeouts because the data forever and they buried in the clearly dominating game is basketball existence the.

Should Snap buy Twitter? Posted 12 hours ago by Alex Wilhelm (@alex), Jonathan Shieber (@jshieber) 0 SHARES Next Story Justin Kan launches his own startup incubator program called Zero-F Now that Snap is flush with public dollars, the question becomes: How to spend it? One suggestion floated as a “what if” scenario among armchair executives in banking, finance and tech over the weekend is that Snap could make a bid for Twitter. To be clear, we have not heard any sources tell us that the two companies are in talks. And reached for comment, Snap said BLAH, and Twitter said BLEURGH (actually Snap didn’t respond to a request for comment and Twitter declined to comment). But there’s more logic than one might think in a potential tie-up. For starters, Twitter has had a not-so-hidden For Sale sign hanging on its front door for some time. Kara Swisher and Kurt Wagner at Re/code detailed the potential bidders last September. Interested buyers reported throughout the Fall of last year included just about everyone. At a price tag of roughly $18 billion, the deals would have been worth a stiff 60 percent premium to Twitter’s current valuation. At one point Apple, Disney, Microsoft, Salesforce and Google were all rumored to be interested in making a bid for Twitter’s twittering masses. If sold at the previously rumored $18 billion mark, Twitter would be a big bite for Snap to swallow, but not a complete impossibility. Notably, both firms have billions in cash, which could make a tie-up interesting from an accounting perspective. At the same time, $18 billion would constitute 56 percent of Snap’s current valuation, using Google Finance’s tallies for both firms. Why is Twitter for sale? While the media-popular social network has a solid user base that has continued to grow, it’s growing at a glacial pace. Meanwhile, investors, especially public market investors, want to invest in rocket ships, not icebergs.  In short, Twitter’s core product isn’t growing usage quickly enough to drive a rising share price, regardless of its corporate financial performance. Dynamic duo? It isn’t hard to summon a clutch of reasons why a Twitter-Snap link-up would prove interesting. Snap is already lining up strategic partnerships (and large investments) with big media companies like NBCUniversal, and live events like the Olympics are big part of that. Twitter has worked along similar lines to bring live sports content to its own platform. Snap’s media play already has some points on its board. As NBCUniversal’s chief executive wrote in a memo to his staff first reported by Re/code: Most notably, we produced a pop-up Discover channel which featured Olympic content produced by BuzzFeed. Throughout the Rio Games, this content generated over two billion views. On the heels of that success, we are already planning an expanded partnership with Snapchat and BuzzFeed for the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. Our entertainment programs have been among the first shows to launch a Snapchat series, including The Voice, SNL and E! News’ The Rundown. We expect to launch even more Snapchat shows with additional NBCU brands in the coming weeks. Buying Twitter would give Snap another live platform that draws millions of viewers from the blue bird’s big deal with the NFL. As others have written, sports content is going to be critical for Snap’s success as a platform. And as Twitter makes a push into e-sports, it could open up another significant streaming market. (That both companies are working to bring sports video to a social network instead of bringing a social network to sports video is notable; there’s likely a lesson in the move for other content verticals.) There are other potential advantages to buying Twitter from the Snap side of things. The company has different demographics from Snap’s millennial media mavens, attracting users whose income doesn’t necessarily depend on an allowance from mom and dad. SnapTwitter could pitch advertisers a way to reach individuals from their youth through to adulthood inside a single social entity. A Twitter buy also allows Snap to pitch products to a new demographic without diluting its brand: Snap could protect its dominance among millennials, while still expanding its reach without fear that a younger generation would leave the platform after seeing it overrun with “olds.” For Tom Goodwin, a senior vice president of digital strategy at Havas Media, Twitter adds a thin layer of content that makes Snap more horizontal and lets it compete with some of the other players who approach content distribution in a more multi-pronged way. It moves from being a channel to a cross-channel player. Finally, Snap’s acquisition could take the social networking fight to Facebook after being on the receiving end of several lumps from the social networking giant. A more visually minded Twitter could conceivably compete more aggressively with Instagram and be more of a challenge to Zuckerberg & co. on their own turf. Facebook itself is more than an explicit threat to Snap. Some observers expect that Snap will eventually monetize at Facebook-like ARPU levels. That seems difficult, given the per-user information advantage that Facebook enjoys over Snap. Twitter lies somewhere in-between, implying that it might be able to help Snap push its ARPU higher than it could on its own. Perhaps. A troubled union Positives aside, there are significant problems with any scenario in which Snap comes in as a White Knight for Twitter’s troubled social network. For one investor we spoke to, brand dollars are easier for a video-centric product like Snap to capture than Twitter. Whatever data Twitter has may also be meaningless for a company like Snap, the investor said. That could limit corporate synergies across ad budgets. Another executive in the media business opined that adding Twitter could open up usership and a new audience, but at an extremely high overhead; that opinion was seconded by a banker. For the deal to work, Snap would have to gut Twitter’s headcount and reduce its infrastructure costs, they both said (although, given the high cost of its own infrastructure — and how that impacts its bottom line — the Twitter buy could give Snap instant scale). “For Snap to go down that path, there would need to be a turn in market sentiment with respect to their growth curve,” the executive said of both companies. In fact, a Snap acquisition of Twitter would probably have been viewed more favorably if the deal was done while Snap was still a private company, the executive claimed. Beyond the problems with investors, Twitter has talent retention issues that have been widely reported in the media. Rapid-fire departures are either a vote of no-confidence in the business by those exiting, or an inability to manage the demands of keeping talent in place by management. Finally, there are Twitter’s well-documented problems with the developer community and its almost comical inability to make money off its active user base. For Snap, which has been pushing away its own influencers through heavy-handed tactics, it may not be a great bet to align itself with another poor talent manager. Still, the parlor game of who should buy Twitter continues to flit its way through the Valley. One investor friend thinks it’s Salesforce’s opportunity to lose, while another thinks the most likely buyer would be Softbank’s still-forming multi-billion dollar fund or one of the big Chinese internet players (who’d view the company as a massive foothold in the U.S. market). Impacts While the Snap-Twitter tie up has a number of potential positives and downsides, it’s worth keeping in mind that any marriage of the two platforms would only work to cement the winner-take-most style of the social space. Consider the companies both dying and dead that Snap left in its wake. If it consumed Twitter as well, the social landscape would constrict further — at least in the United States — to something approaching a duopoly. Capitalized messaging companies that have failed to raise capital in recent years total at least 12. That list of social startups has raised a combined $739 million to date. If they fail to find an exit, all that illiquid capital could disappear. And if Snap buys Twitter, the move could satiate its appetite for acquisitions for years to come. Big bites, etc. If Snap stops buying, who else might have enough capital and gumption to get purchasing? It isn’t clear. Twitter could, therefore, act as a blocking agent in the event of a union with the younger Snap. Snap is the new kid, Facebook the big brother. If you already spurned your eldest sibling, perhaps a battlefield alliance with the middle child is a prudent possibility. The enemy of Zuck is my Jack?

Dustin Lee Camp was arraigned on several charges including rape, pandering and gross sexual imposition. The case was forwarded to Springfield detectives from the Cuyahoga County Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force in February. Court documents show that around February 5 Google became aware of images and conversations between Camp and an unknown individual about child pornography and child molestation. Google reported these conversations and three images of apparent child pornography to law enforcement. According to the documents, Google identified the owner of the suspect email address as Dustin Camp at a Springfield address. Police obtained a search warrant for Camp’s home in the 400 block of South Schaffer Street and searched the home on March 1. Police found six mobile phones and two laptop computers in the residence. Camp was taken to police headquarters where he admitted to raping a child victim less than two years old to investigators. Camp also admitted ejaculating into the child’s diaper while she was wearing it. Further, Camp said he took the three images captured by Google and sent them over the internet. Camp was arrested and charged with rape, gross sexual imposition, two counts of pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor and pandering obscenity involving a minor. Camp pleaded not guilty to the charges in court Monday. He is now being held in the Clark County Jail on $70,000 bond. Keep checking WDTN.com for the latest news, weather and sports.

Here's how to find the one that's right for you. Wearable Tech by Scott Stein March 6, 2017 12:02 PM PST @jetscott by Dan Graziano March 6, 2017 12:02 PM PST @DanGraziano Sarah Tew/CNET If you're shopping for a piece of wearable tech in 2017, you're facing compromises. Smartwatches and fitness trackers aren't really the must-have devices many companies hoped they would be. And no, you don't really need one. But if you're looking for a piece of tech for your wrist, here are the best choices right now, followed by a list of what you need to consider. The best smartwatches and fitness trackers right now The best smartwatches right now For the iPhone: Apple Watch Series 1 (but see below about the Series 2) For Android: Samsung Gear S3 For most people, The Apple Watch Series 1 is all you'd need. But if you want to swim or use GPS away from your phone, the Series 2 is the one to get. (And note: If you have an original Apple Watch, there's not a huge need to upgrade to the Series 2 unless you really need that swim-proofing or GPS tracking.) But the Apple Watch wins mainly because it's well hooked-in to iOS, and functions as a great wrist-remote. The Apple Watch isn't perfect by any means, but its feature set is ahead of the competition. The decision gets harder for Android users. Android Wear is the most hooked-in platform that connects to Google's apps and services (including Google Assistant), and Android Wear 2.0 is a big improvement. But there aren't any truly great watches for Android Wear yet. LG's Watch Sport and Watch Style, the first to have the updated software, are full of limitations. Sarah Tew/CNET The best watch hardware isn't Android Wear at all: it's the Samsung Gear S3. Samsung's large smartwatch has deep features and decent fitness tracking modes, plus use-anywhere Samsung Pay (which requires Android). But it requires a separate set of Samsung Gear apps and syncs to Samsung S-Health for fitness. This requires more conduits and app plug-ins than you might have patience for. It's not as seamless an experience, and sometimes feels too removed from core Android functions. If you have an Android phone and you're absolutely sold on getting a smartwatch, the Samsung Gear S3 is the best option right now, but that could change once older Android Wear watches are updated to Android Wear 2.0. We're also waiting for Fitbit, Misfit and other companies to release their smartwatches in 2017. 10 The smartwatches and fitness trackers we can't wait to see in 2017 The best fitness trackers A Fitbit is the right choice for most people. The whole range can track the basics like steps, distance, calories burned and sleep, and some can even measure heart rate and include guided breathing sessions. One of the reasons we recommend Fitbit is for the app. If one of your friends owns a fitness tracker, there's a good chance it's a Fitbit -- the company has the largest user base. The benefit of this is being able to compete with friends and family members in a variety of competitions, which helps keep you motivated and more likely to reach your goal. The app also integrates a number of third-party devices and services. For most people, the Fitbit Charge 2 is the tracker to get. (Note: The just-announced Fitbit Alta HR should be considered as well.) For a more basic (and swim-proof) tracker, we recommend the Fitbit Flex 2. Looking for a fitness smartwatch? The Fitbit Blaze is worth a look. Sarah Tew/CNET The best non-Fitbit tracker A reason to skip the Fitbit would be if you're already invested in an ecosystem like Withings or Garmin. In that case, it's best to get one of their trackers. The Garmin Vivomove is our favorite tracker that doesn't look like a tracker. The Garmin Vivosmart HR (or HR+ for GPS) is our favorite traditional Garmin fitness tracker. The Withings Steel HR is our favorite Withings tracker. The best GPS watches Athletes and outdoor enthusiasts are better off with a GPS watch to accurately measure pace, distance, speed and other metrics. For casual and serious runners, our favorite is the Garmin Forerunner 235. For casual multisport athletes it's the Garmin Vivoactive HR. Serious triathletes should check out the Forerunner 735XT. For the ultimate multisport and outdoor watch, there's the Garmin Fenix 3 HR , but it will soon be replaced by the newly announced Fenix 5. All of these watches are waterproof down to at least 50 meters, include multiple sport profiles, can track daily fitness metrics like steps, sleep and heart rate, and can display notifications from an iPhone and Android phone. Sarah Tew/CNET The best GPS bike computers Cyclists should consider a GPS bike computer for measuring distance and speed. These devices can also connect with other sensors on your bike to measure additional metrics like cadence and power. For beginners, we recommend the Polar M450. More serious riders should check out the Garmin Edge 520. Shopping for wearables: What you need to know The wearable market is getting smaller. Fitbit bought Pebble, Jawbone has pivoted away from consumer trackers, and other companies (such as Motorola) have put their smartwatch plans on hold. But there's still a wide variety of smartwatches and trackers to choose from. Here's how to find the right one. Android or iPhone? That still matters, to a degree. The Apple Watch works with iPhones -- and only iPhones. Android phones work with Android Wear. Samsung's Gear S2 and S3 watches work with Android phones, too. Both Android Wear and Samsung watches pair with iPhones, but in a more limited way that is nowhere as good as what the Apple Watch offers. Fitness bands tend to work cross-platform, but not always. Does charging a watch annoy you? Many premium smartwatches still have battery life of two days or less between charges. The Apple Watch, Google's Android Wear watches, and Samsung's Gear S2 and S3 are high-maintenance, and need daily or every-other-day charging. Are you ready to live with that? If so, the Apple Watch, Samsung Gear S3 or an updated Android Wear 2.0 watch might be worth a try. Pebble's long-battery smartwatches still exist, but Pebble's sale to Fitbit and Pebble's uncertain watch future as a platform means we don't recommend current models anymore. Sarah Tew/CNET Do you want a great fitness tracker? Most wearable bands and watches aim for fitness tracking, but some are better than others. The best pure overall fitness tracker is still the Fitbit Charge 2. Garmin also makes several good alternatives, and good running watches. Full-featured smartwatches like the Apple Watch and Android Wear 2.0 watches can track activities and work with many third-party fitness apps, but connect mainly to Apple Health and Google Fit for synced data. Do you want to swim with it? Many wearables are water resistant to at least wash-your-hands or quick-dunk-in-a-sink level, but the list of real swim-proof trackers and watches is short. You want to look for 3ATM or 5ATM, or anything that suggests meters of water resistance. The Apple Watch Series 2, Fitbit Flex 2, Withings Steel HR, Misfit Ray, Garmin Vivoactive HR and Garmin Forerunner 235 are some of our favorite swim-friendly wearables. The Pebble 2, Pebble Time and Time Steel are swim-friendly, too. But they don't all do swim tracking. For swim tracking, look into the Garmin Vivoactive HR, Garmin Fenix 3 HR, Garmin Forerunner 735XT, Apple Watch Series 2, Misfit Ray, Withings Steel HR and Fitbit Flex 2. Sarah Tew/CNET Watches with built-in phones aren't great, but they exist Some smartwatches come with phone service inside. The Samsung Gear S3 Frontier, LG Watch Sport and Verizon's upcoming Wear24 work with SIM cards and can function as independent phones. Samsung and LG's watches work with T-Mobile and AT&T, while Verizon's Wear24 is, well, Verizon. Phone service can be useful in case of emergency, but it drains battery life on the watch and requires an extra monthly payment (currently $5 a month on T-Mobile, $10 a month on AT&T) to use. AT&T allows phone-number syncing across devices. You can pay for things with your watch Lots of smartwatches support mobile payments now. They mostly work the same way. Apple Watches have Apple Pay. Samsung's Gear S2 and S3 watches can use Samsung Pay. It adds an extra wrinkle on the S3 model with MST, a technology that works at regular credit card terminals as well as tap-to-pay ones. Android Wear 2.0-updated watches will work with Android Pay as long as the watch has NFC. Not all Android Wear watches do. Right now, in fact, the only Android Pay-enabled watch is the LG Watch Sport.

If you own one of the smartphones in the list below, you’ll now be able to download the factory images and the over-the-air (OTA) files directly from Google. Similar to past security updates the security update cutoff is the Nexus 9 tablet. Here’s a full list of factory image downloads for Pixel and Nexus devices currently running Android 7.1.1 Nougat: Google Pixel XL (NOF27B) Google Pixel XL (Rogers only) (NOF27C) Google Pixel (NOF27B) Google Pixel (Rogers only) (NOF27C) Google Pixel C (N4F26T) Nexus 6P (N4F26T) Nexus 6P (Verizon only) (NUF26N) Nexus 5X (N4F26T) Nexus 6 (N6F26U) LTE Nexus 9 (N4F26T) Wi-Fi Nexus 9 (N4F26T) All of the security fixes in the latest security update can be found here. The most significant fix in the update allowed hackers to execute remote code via email, web browsing and MMS when the phone processes media files. Google says that there have been no examples of this exploit being used in the wild, but that the flaw has been patched.

Current Galaxy S7 Edge (on Telus) is still stuck on a Nov 1, 2016 security patch level. Not sure if it’s because of Samsung or Telus (or both) but either way pretty poor for a flagship device gommer strike Well that’s just the way it is for devices from carriers, and I’m sure you knew that going in. Yes it’s a year behind. But it’s not a surprise, nor will it be changing anytime soon. Eluder Got my Pixel updated a few hours ago, obviously nothing too noteworthy, but nice to get updates promptly. LarryD Unlocked S7 on Fido and still waiting for Nougat and last security patch was from November. So much for Samsung promises of regular updates. Yeah, so piss poor performance on their part.

In order to mark the occasion, Google has revealed the most popular apps, games, books, movies, songs, and albums of all time on Google Play Why You Shouldn't Trust App Ratings on Google Play Why You Shouldn't Trust App Ratings on Google Play You need a new camera app; you open Google Play and find 50. Naturally, you install the highest-rated one. Guess what? You just got tricked. Read More . Since 2012, Google Play has grown to serve 1 billion active users in 190 countries. Millions of apps, games, books, movies, songs, and albums are available from Google’s digital retail park. And thanks to a post on Google’s The Keyword blog, we now know the most popular content. The Top Fives of Google Play What follows are the top fives of Google Play across a number of categories. The lists of apps and games only take downloads into account, so any that are pre-installed on Android devices are excluded. Which is why no Google apps make the cut despite being generally brilliant. The Most Popular Apps Facebook Facebook Messenger Pandora Radio Instagram Snapchat The Most Popular Games Candy Crush Saga Subway Surfers Temple Run 2 Despicable Me Clash of Clans The Most Popular Books Fifty Shades of Grey by EL James The Hunger Games Trilogy by Suzanne Collins A Game of Thrones by George RR Martin The Fault in Our Stars by John Green Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn The Most Popular Movies The Interview Frozen Deadpool Star Wars: The Force Awakens Guardians of the Galaxy The Most Popular Songs Thinking Out Loud by Ed Sheeran Royals by Lorde Blank Space by Taylor Swift Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson Feat.

Because, let’s face it, Facebook, Instagram, Candy Crush, Fifty Shades of Grey, Star Wars, Taylor Swift, and Adele were always going to figure. Still, it’s nice to know that what we all assume is popular is what’s actually popular. Have you downloaded any of the apps, games, books, movies, songs, or albums listed above? How do you rate the overall Google Play experience? What one thing do you wish Google would change about Google Play? Please let us know in the comments below!

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS Google Assistant gets a baby tracker, art history, and its funniest service yet Khari Johnson@kharijohnson March 6, 2017 12:42 PM Above: Google Home Image Credit: Google About a dozen new Google Assistant actions have been made available in recent days, including a baby activity monitor and a train tracker for San Francisco’s BART system. More than 30 new actions have been added for Google Assistant in the course of the past week, representing the largest addition of new services since the platform at the end of 2016. New actions added last week include a beer guide, slang dictionary, and some that draw on Hindu and Christian scripture. All of the 118 skills available today have been added since the launch of the Actions on Google platform last December. By comparison, Alexa has more than 10,000 skills made by third party developers. That may seem like a lot, but ecosystems can grow fast. This time last year, Alexa had a little over 100 skills. Among the Google Assistant actions added in recent days is Baby Stats for logging and tracking baby activity like when they eat, sleep, or go to the bathroom. I wonder just how helicopter-y parents will get when an action like this is mixed with a virtual assistant especially made for parents or emerging wearable devices for babies. Life Stories, based on the fairly large database from fmylife.com, may be the funniest action available today. Drawing from a community of human misery, Life Stories rattles off random and top stories of failures and misfortune in the tradition of FML online, things like: “Today my dog ate a whole case of my son’s paint balls because apparently they are made of a fish byproduct. Not only does the whole house smell like fish, there are countless bright yellow dog turds all over the house and our yard. F*ck my life.” Warning: This action contains a fair deal of mature content, like the F word. Like Life Stories and the World Air Quality Index, the Artsy action rests on a lush dataset. Made by Artsy, the Art Genome Project is a collection of more than 1,000 biographies of prominent artists from Raphael to Ai Weiwei. Can’t wait for this action to include descriptions of art periods and styles so I can show off to my friends and talk about the difference between Renaissance and Byzantine art styles. Danish Games action will give the latest Euro Jackpot or Danish lottery numbers. San Francisco finally got its own public transportation action with SF Transit. Just ask when the next BART train is leaving the station near you and it will rattle off a list of trains leaving within the next 30 minutes. Getting around London should be super easy now. With Departure Mate and Line Status, there are now four different Google Assistant actions to help you ride the London Tube. Other public transit actions will help you catch a bus in Dublin, Singapore, and New Zealand. Finally, the Weather Sky action, from the makers of the Dark Sky smartphone app, gives you information based on weather anywhere in the United States. That’s pretty simple — Google Assistant can already do that — but Weather Sky can give you information about weather anywhere in the U.S. in the past. So if you ask questions like “What was the weather like June 1, 1965 in Wichita, Kansas?,” after a time travel sound effect the skill will say “The weather was mostly cloudy and the temperature was 78 degrees. There was a moderate breeze with winds at 15 mph from the southwest and most of the sky was covered by clouds. The air felt quite humid at the time, with a relative humidity of 70 percent and there was rain in the area. Visibility was 10 miles. Rain was active in the area and began at approximately 10 a.m. The rain stopped after two hours at about noon.” The action goes on like this for another 30 seconds, talking about high and low temperatures, sunrise and sunset, and the stage of the lunar cycle that day. All this information may not be of practical value to everyone, but it’s fun to recall memorable days in your life or family history and then ask the skill what the weather was at the time. It sort of helps paint a better picture in your mind of what that day was like. In other recent Google Assistant news, last week the intelligent assistant was made available to millions of Android smartphone users who have the Marshmallow or Nougat operating system, and Pullstring brought the ability to make Google Assistant actions to its bot-making platform. New features were also brought to Allo, the chat app with Google Assistant as its main feature. Right now, Google Assistant third-party actions like the kinds listed above are only available on Google Home smart speakers.

Google today published the Android Security Bulletin for March 2017, detailing the Android vulnerabilities that’ve recently been discovered and the patches that fix ‘em. Google says that there will be two security patches this month, one for March 1 and one for March 5, to give its partners the flexibility to quickly patch a set of vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices. There are 21 vulnerabilities that’ve been identified this month, with three of the issues being classified as “Critical.” The good news is that Google hasn’t received any reports of this month’s issues being exploited. All Android partners were notified of the vulnerabilities on February 6 or earlier. Google will be pushing the March 5 update (which includes the March 1 fixes as well) to Nexus and Pixel devices over the air. If you don’t feel like waiting for your OTA update to arrive and you’re comfortable with manually flashing a factory image, you can find those right here. Many folks store important personal info on their devices, whether that’s photos, passwords, or whatever else, so it’s important that our phones be as secure as possible. Google is working to keep Android phones safe with its monthly security patches, so if you’ve got a Nexus or Pixel device, be on the lookout for your March update.

Name: Subject: Message: Obama’s planned coup and Google’s part in the spreading of fake news Newsby Brian Reigh12 hours ago 33 169 14 You’ve probably heard a thing or two about fake news by now. And no, I don’t mean the CNN; I mean baseless headlines floating around the web whose primary purpose is political manipulation. While companies like Facebook have been at the center of heavy criticism after the surprising election result here in the US – and the social network has since implemented ways to combat fake news on its site – Google somehow managed to remain immune to the public outcry, for the most part. Well, not so fast, you colorful little search engine. As it turns out, Google did and still does play a huge role in promulgating fake news, and the company must take action to address what could ultimately be detrimental to the American democracy. How many times have you seen headlines such as “Pope Francis officially endorses Donald Trump” or “Hillary Clinton involved in child sex-trafficking” or really, anything absurd along those lines? If you’re on Facebook, probably at least once. These are what we call fake news, or stories that simply are false. And they can distort people’s perception of public figures and events and consequently have an irreversible impact on politics. Indeed, it’s a curious problem of the 21st century where information has become so accessible yet the validation of its sources isn’t necessarily there. Indeed, it’s a curious problem of the 21st century where information has become so accessible yet the validation of its sources isn’t necessarily there. Now, Facebook has acknowledged this widespread issue and is working to reduce fake news on its site, but what about companies like Google? Why haven’t Google and its parent company Alphabet been under scrutiny? Is it because they’re not affected by fake news? Well, apparently that’s not the case. First of all, as you may already know, many “conspiracy theory” videos circulate via YouTube, an Alphabet-owned website. Absurd allegations like Pizzagate have been promoted and shared on Alphabet’s platform. If you’re wondering if Obama is planning a coup, Google’s “one true answer” is yes. FFS. pic.twitter.com/pFr7omJttU — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) March 5, 2017 Second, even Google’s search engine itself has some serious issues. As shown by Danny Sullivan of SearchEngineLand above, when asked questions like “Is Obama planning a coup?” or “Is Obama planning martial law?” Google cites extreme right websites as if those are factually correct (and no, they are not; as you may have noticed, no coup has happened). Of course, since Google Home devices use the same network as Google Search, its answer is just as ridiculous: And here’s what happens if you ask Google Home “is Obama planning a coup?” pic.twitter.com/MzmZqGOOal — Rory Cellan-Jones (@ruskin147) March 5, 2017 As Eric Johnson of Recode points out, when asked the same question, Amazon’s Alexa simply says she cannot find the answer. So while Google may be better at giving an answer, that answer may not necessarily be fact-checked. When he reached out to Google, he received the following response: Featured Snippets in Search provide an automatic and algorithmic match to a given search query, and the content comes from third-party sites. Unfortunately, there are instances when we feature a site with inappropriate or misleading content. When we are alerted to a Featured Snippet that violates our policies, we work quickly to remove them, which we have done in this instance. We apologize for any offense this may have caused. While it’s reassuring that Google did indeed take action to remove that answer, it’s still troubling that the biggest search engine in the world isn’t proactively combatting an issue that could limit our access to information and ultimately hurt democracy as an institution. While its promise to reduce financial incentives for these websites is a good start, the effort cannot end there as shown here. Have you noticed any fake news or fake information on Google lately?

The internet giant reacted after a blog post highlighted unsubstantiated search results indicating former president Barack Obama was planning a “coup d’etat’ and that four former US presidents were members of the Ku Klux Klan. The weekend post from Search Engine Land editor Danny Sullivan found Google delivered “terribly wrong” answers to some queries in its “one true answer” box at the top of search results and in queries to its Google Home speaker. “The problematic examples I review don’t appear to have been deliberate attempts,” Sullivan wrote. “Rather, they seem to be the result of Google’s algorithms and machine learning making bad selections.” Sullivan said when he asked the speaker if US Republicans were the same as Nazis, it answered in the affirmative. Fake news Similarly, he cited an example in which Google’s search engine listed four former US presidents as “active and known” KKK members, even though there has been no conclusive historical evidence supporting that. The news comes amid a growing controversy over “fake news” circulating online via Google or Facebook, and efforts by the internet giants to weed out hoaxes and misinformation. In a statement to AFP, Google said its boxed results at the top of a search query, known as “featured snippets,” are based on an algorithmic formula. “Unfortunately, there are instances when we feature a site with inappropriate or misleading content,” Google’s statement said. “When we are alerted to a featured snippet that violates our policies, we work quickly to remove them, which we have done in this instance. We apologize for any offense this may have caused.” Google also noted it includes a “feedback” link under these snippets that can allow the search giant to flag or remove inappropriate content. - © AFP, 2017 Read: Allegations that his wife earned €830,000 in a “fake job” could end a man’s bid for France’s presidency> Get breaking news from TheJournal.ie via Facebook.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat Google today is announcing that it’s switching to a modern approach called neural machine translation for translations of text in Hindi, Russian, and Vietnamese in its Google Translate app. The shift away from Google’s phrase-based machine translation system will result in more natural, higher-quality translations. Google adopted this method to translate from English into Chinese in September, and brought it to English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Turkish, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean translations in November. Now it’s available for three more languages in Google Translate for Android, iOS, and the web, as well as Google Search and the Google App. It will come next to web page translations in Google’s Chrome browser. Support for neural machine translation in even more languages will arrive in the next few weeks, Google Translate product lead Barak Turovsky wrote in a blog post. The commitment isn’t a surprise, but the near-term timeline is. Google has said it will move to neural machine translation for all 103 of the languages that Translate works with. Neural machine translation entails training artificial neural networks — in Google’s case, long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs) — on available data and then getting them to make inferences about new incoming queries. Google has also looked to this approach to artificial intelligence (AI) to generate Smart Replies to messages in various products, recognize objects and people in images, and even make its data centers run more efficiently. Google isn’t the company tapping AI to boost translations. Microsoft has done the same thing in its Translator app. While Google is plenty proud of its smarter translations, the company does still very much appreciate real people’s contributions through the Translate Community — people shouldn’t stop contributing to it, Turovsky wrote.

WIRE Google Home Shares Fake News as Facebook Adds a Fact-Checking Initiative The fight against fake news continues, but some battles may be harder than others. By Emily Canal Emily Canal is a reporter at Inc. Previously, she wrote for Forbes Magazine, The New York Times and The Boston Globe. @emilycanal Reporter, Inc.com@emilycanal WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement It might be a good idea to think twice before using Google Home as a source for all your political questions. The virtual-assistant device is the latest technology to regurgitate fake news from the Web and present it as facts. On Sunday, BBC News correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones asked Google Home whether Barack Obama was planning a coup, the smart speaker said that the former president is "in bed with the Communist Chinese," and may "in fact be planning a Communist coup d'état at the end of his term." This occurs when Google attempts to answer by pulling information from the Web. When a user asks, "What is the capital of America," for instance, Google can pull from reputable sources to answer the question in a "Knowledge Graph," according to The Outline. If the search engine can't find information from a reputable source, it turns to outside "off-the-wall" sources and creates a "Featured Snippet." Quartz reporter Mike Murphy asked Amazon Echo the same questions as Cellan-Jones, but the device said it did not understand the questions. Google told Quartz it fixes problems like the ones listed above manually when it's alerted to them. Fake news and how it's spread came under the microscope during the 2016 presidential election. Since then, several social-media sites have take measures to either identify false reports or take them down. Facebook joined the campaign on Friday after debuting a "disputed" tag that will appear under news items that have been deemed inaccurate. What's more, Facebook, Google, and several news organizations teamed up to fight fake news in France by launching a fact-checking tool ahead of the county's presidential elections. YouTube is another site that struggles with fake news. While the video-sharing website has a news vertical that features content from publishers--with approval from Google News--the site may be ungovernable, given the amount of video uploaded per day.

Cam Bunton6 March 2017Phones Pocket-lint 4.0 stars £550 For Nice build, big scale, colourful and high-resolution AMOLED display, camera is great, fast-charging tech Against No Google Play by default will be tricky for casual users, no capacitive buttons or softkeys in the software Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment You often hear the age-old rhetoric that China is taking over the world, and nowhere is that more clear than in the smartphone market. Companies like Huawei, Oppo and Vivo are now in the top five global smartphone vendors. And for good reason: they're making some top product. One company you may not be aware of is Meizu. Like Xiaomi - another popular Chinese smartphone maker - it's known for producing great quality hardware at relatively affordable prices. The Meizu Pro 6 Plus is the company's biggest and best phone, yet still costs considerably less than an iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel XL or Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. But, is it a great phone?  Meizu Pro 6 Plus review: Design 155.6 x 77.3 x 7.3mm 158g in weight All metal chassis with curved edges Like so many other China-made Android phones, the design is immediately familiar. But then again, when it comes to premium phones, the current choices for staying on trend are limited. You can either use an all-metal back and be forced to have antenna bands running along it (like the iPhone), or go with glass (like a Samsung Galaxy). Pocket-lint On the whole, Meizu has built a phone that's both attractive to look at and pleasant to hold in the hand. In many ways, it reminds us of the similarly designed (and sized) Oppo F1 plus. It's roughly the same width as an iPhone 7 Plus, too, so it's still quite big - but it does have a larger screen, making its overall smaller footprint an impressive feat.  The metal back panel is anodised - our review unit in gold, but other colours are available - with antenna bands at the top and bottom. They're not your typical completely straight bands though, as they're curved to match the curves of the phone's edges. The camera sits near the top, placed centrally above an unusual LED flash ring (which is made up of multiple dual-tone LED lights) that surrounds the laser focus sensor. On the front, there's a single pill-shaped home button which also acts as the fingerprint scanner. Unusually, there are no capacitive buttons joining the home button, and there are no typical home, back or multitasking virtual buttons on the screen either. Pocket-lint As far as other ports, switches and buttons go, they're in the places you'd expect to find them. The bottom edge features the USB Type-C port, the loudspeaker grille and the 3.5mm jack. The top edge has nothing except the noise-cancelling microphone, while the power button and volume rocker live on the right side of the phone, and the dual SIM tray lives on the left edge. Although it's not a one-handed device by any stretch of the imagination (or your grip), the Pro 6 is impressively slim for a device with such a big screen and powerful innards.  Meizu Pro 6 Plus review: All the pixels 5.7-inch Quad HD (2560 x 1440) display Super AMOLED 1000:1 contrast ratio 3D touch-like technology As smartphone screens go, the 5.7-inch display on the Meizu Pro 6 Plus is definitely at the larger end of the scale. And it's when looking at it that we get our first hint that Meizu really is going after flagship territory with this beast. It's a Quad HD resolution panel built using Super AMOLED technology (similar to Samsung's best phones). It's big, bright and colourful, while boasting a 1000:1 contrast ratio - meaning those blacks look really inky and dark and combine well with the bright saturated colours. Pocket-lint One of things that's quite striking about the Pro 6 Plus' screen is how clear and bright it is. It doesn't seem to matter what angle you're looking at the phone from, the content just pops, like there's no interface between you and what's on display. It's just you and your movie or game. It's genuinely beautiful.  As a bonus, Meizu has built in a pressure-sensitive layer into the screen to enable 3D Touch-like features, giving you the option to press hard on app icons to bring up bespoke quick actions. In a lot of ways, this is similar to the latest iPhones; giving you the ability to send a quick text from the messages icon, or create a new contact from the dialler icon, among others. Meizu Pro 6 Plus review: Exynos inside Exynos 8890 processor, 4GB RAM 3,400mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 USB 3.1 support Depending on whether you buy the 64GB or 128GB version of the Pro 6 you'll get different internal specifications. For instance, while both come with 4GB RAM, the lower storage model's Exynos 8890 processor is clocked at a slightly lower speed to the more capacious 128GB version. Likewise, the higher storage model has a slightly more powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) too. Pocket-lint Regardless of which one you end up going with, Samsung's Exynos 8890 processor inside is one of the most powerful chips available on the market. In fact, this is the same chip that powers the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. In short: it's no slouch. In daily use it launches apps and videos without showing any signs of effort. It's fast, fluid and rarely stutters or pauses for a breath. Likewise, unlocking the phone using the home button's fingerprint sensor is virtually instant, providing you don't get the unmatched fingerprint message, which did happen a couple of times a day.  Providing the audio chops is a DAC capable of producing 32-bit/192kHz audio which is designed to produce great sounding music without consuming a lot of power. Not many phones are able to deliver high-end audio such as this, so it's good to see support for those high-end music aficionados. Meizu Pro 6 Plus preview: Battery life Backing all of this processing power is a 3,400mAh battery, which is enough juice to get you through a full day without issue, but not likely to get you far into a second day unless you're a very light user. For those times when the battery is running really low and you know you won't make it to a power outlet for a while, there's a software feature which lets you enter a super mode to dramatically reduce battery consumption. It limits you to just phone and text messages and switches to a simple black and white theme.  Meizu claims that its battery is long-lasting and can survive up to twice as long as regular batteries, with a lifetime of over 900 cycles. Obviously we can't test this, having only owned the phone for around a month (at the time of writing). Pocket-lint Once it depletes, the Quick Charge 3.0 enabled power adapter can fill it speedily. Its USB cable has been designed specifically to deal with high wattage power transfer up to 60W (MacBook charger territory). The phone has short circuit protection to ensure it doesn't overheat or short circuit, as an additional security measure. As well as all that, it's worth mentioning that the phone supports USB 3.1 via a USB Type-C port giving you data transfer speeds up to 5Gbps. Matching that speediness, the fingerprint sensor on the front is claimed to be one of the fastest out there, and our initial testing does nothing to dispel those claims. The phone unlocks within the blink of an eye. Well, more the touch of a finger. Meizu Pro 6 Plus review: Flyme to the moon Flyme 5.2 software Runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow No Google Play services out of box As is the case for most Chinese smartphone manufacturers, Meizu's big flagship phone runs a heavily skinned custom version of Android, called Flyme. It's in version 5.2 currently, which uses Android 6.0 Marshmallow as its foundation, but you wouldn't know it from looking at it. Some basic core elements of Android just aren't there initially. For instance, there are no on-screen virtual home, back or multitasking buttons despite the fact that there aren't any capacitive ones. Instead, to go back you have to touch lightly on the home button, and to launch the multi-tasking screen you have to swipe upwards from the bottom of the display. Pocket-lint It also doesn't ship with Google staple apps and services, so there's no Play Store, Google Maps or anything else. However, there is a way to manually install them by downloading the Google Installer APK. You can do this from the preinstalled "app store", or by using other unofficial sources, like APKMirror. This took a few goes to get right and required resetting and rebooting the phone more times than we would have liked. However, once we got that installed, we were able to download and install all of our favourite and most-used apps. That's one of the limitations of a Chinese company that hasn't fully adapted to the out-the-box UK experience. As you'd expect, there's also no app drawer, which means all of your apps live on the home screen. That means either arranging everything into folders, or just downloading a third-party launcher for a more traditional Android look and feel. Similar to many other modern 'droid phone, the Flyme software has a phone management app for optimisation. You can use it to perform virus checking, RAM clearing to kill background apps, delete old and useless files, and so forth. Pocket-lint There's also a handy toolbox app that gives you instant access to things like a compass, spirit level, flashlight and ruler. They're obviously not as useful or reliable as their genuine physical counterparts, but useful to have in a pinch when you don't have your trusty Stanley measuring tape to hand.  Meizu Pro 6 Plus review: Camera happy 12MP Sony sensor 10 LED flash ring 4-axis OIS (optical stabilisation) The Pro 6 Plus' flagship claims are bolstered even further by its camera capabilities. Images are captured by a 12-megapixel Sony sensor with large 1.25μm pixels to produce great shots in low-light conditions. Combine that with the 4-axis optical image stabilisation, f/2.0 aperture and 6-element lens, and you should see great results, and you should be able to snap them quickly thanks to the laser-guided autofocus. Pocket-lint Meizu has also built-in what it calls the "latest generation high-performance ISP image processor" and paired the camera with a unique dual tone flash ring made up of 10 individual LEDs. In other words, you should be able to shoot smooth, noise- and blur-free shots with great colour regardless of the lighting conditions. What all of this means is that you can take great looking shots in most circumstances. Focusing and capture times are virtually instant, and the plethora of useful camera features and modes should be enough to keep anyone occupied.  Like so many other phone cameras there's a manual shooting mode too. This gives you control over shutter speed, ISO sensitivity, manual focus, exposure compensation, saturation, contrast and white balance. There's also the usual collection of video and still modes like panorama, beauty mode and slow-mo as well as some more unusual ones.  There's Macro mode for taking close-up shots of small objects, GIF mode for creating animated GIFs and even a Light Field mode which takes a series of photos in one with the focus set at different focal lengths.  Pocket-lint End results, in most instances, are nicely balanced and naturally coloured. Low-light scenes don't pose too much trouble, with very little image noise creeping in unless things get really dark. It doesn't struggle to focus, unless an object is really, really close to the lens. All in all, it's a great camera.  Verdict In the Pro 6, Meizu clearly shows why Chinese manufacturers need to be taken seriously. It's a quality product with only a few shortcomings.  The biggest concern for many regular consumers will be the lack of Google Play Services as standard. While you can install them yourself with a bit of know-how, that's an extra step that's just beyond the comfort zone of many casual smartphone users who'll want something that works out of the box. Oh, and the lack of capacitive buttons and softkeys might be seen as an oddity by many. Apart from that, Meizu has built a phone that competes with the best of them in virtually every regard, and does it at a lower price. A company to watch for the future? We think so. Alternatives to consider... Pocket-lint OnePlus 3T Its screen is slightly smaller at 5.5-inches, and features a less pixel-dense 1080p full HD display, but as an overall experience the OnePlus 3T is one of the most complete phones out there. It's solid, charges really quickly and is a smooth, fast performer that costs even less than the Meizu.

Image: THE ASAHI SHIMBUN VIA GETTY IMAGES By Kerry Flynn2017-03-06 20:00:15 UTC "Media Organizations Make Pilgrimage To Facebook Headquarters To Lay Content At Foot Of Mark Zuckerberg," reads the headline of perhaps my favorite article from The Onion.  It's a satire, of course, but the act of media companies traveling to Facebook's headquarters and speaking about how each party can better serve each other is, in fact, a reality. Two weeks ago, 15 of the top stakeholders in local media traveled to the New York office to do exactly that, among a day of other publisher-focused events including one on video monetization, previously reported by Digiday.  The roundtable for local news included partnership groups like the Local Media Association and the Local Media Consortium, as well as media companies like Gannett, TEGNA and McClatchy. The three participants, who Mashable spoke with, seemed optimistic about the future relationship given Facebook's commitment to listening, transparency and execution. "I think it’s been really encouraging to see them opening up their news and content sides of their business to work with media companies because Facebook has been, 'We’re just a platform and everyone else can use it or not or go to hell,'" said Gordon Borrell, CEO of Borrell Associates and chairman of Local Media Association. "They’ve become reactively engaged." What's happening  It took awhile for Facebook to engage so closely, yet that timeline wasn't surprising to publishers. "It took us that long to get with Google. About 10 years ago, Google was like, you give me your archives and we'll digitize them," said Rusty Coats, executive director of the Local Media Consortium.  In January, Facebook announced the "Facebook Journalism Project," an initiative to collaborate with media outlet and provide new tools and training for journalists. In the week prior, Facebook hired Campbell Brown, former NBC and CNN journalist, to serve as the new head of news partnerships.  So far, Facebook is impressing publishers more than Google did. "There seems to be a bigger openness with the folks at Facebook to go in and learn. Before with Google, it was we’re going to tell you how it works. With Facebook, it’s tell us how," Borrell said.  Facebook already has some tools to offer based on publisher feedback. At the meeting last month, Brown began the day with an introduction and a welcome and spoke about monetization, highlighting new ways publishers can more easily make money from their content shared on Facebook. Brown said publishers soon will be able to insert more ads into Instant Articles, perhaps every 150 words. These changes to the ad load are not finalized and could change. Facebook also presented its new option for publishers to insert ad breaks, a.k.a. mid-rolls ads, in videos, which it is currently testing with a select number of partners.  "There was a lot of negative reaction to mid-roll, but when they showed us the tool, it was simple, easy to implement," said Nancy Lane, president of Local Media Association. "They showcased that they were listening loud and clear." Brainstorming  The meeting also included a brainstorming session, where Facebook engineers and product managers sat down with participants to discuss potential updates to the product itself. "This could compete with Twitter, and I think they had interest in it." Coats of the Local Media Consortium said he would like to see more information surfaced from Facebook's Groups, like which ones are the most popular in the area.  "It would help know how to better cover my market, capturing that master narrative," he said, likening it to the readership surveys he used to do while working for newspapers.  Coats also suggested more localized trending topics.  Lane said they discussed and made mockups of how local news could be reimagined of the site. For instance, they drew an "opt-in local News Feed" on tablets.  "There's real value in that, opt-in, consumer-driven, in Facebook," Lane said. "We don't know what's going to come of it. It's their company. We have to play by their rules. This could compete with Twitter, and I think they had interest in it."  For now, publishers can expect more commitment from the Facebook Journalism Project with regional meetings and larger events. Members of the team have already met with publishers in Dallas and Atlanta. Seattle and San Diego are up next.  Facebook is, for the first time, integrating a news and publisher track into F8, its annual developers conference. Brown is also scheduled to host an event with the local Media Consortium in May, according to Coats.  Still figuring it out  This moment in history required action not just by Facebook, but also an admission from publishers that Facebook is a game they have to play. Publishers "have seen themselves as owners," Borrell said, "and they've had to learn." "This is consumer-driven. Consumers are going to Facebook to get their news," Lane said.  But there are still some publishers at the early stages of figuring the transition out. Facebook is changing that, in part, with the Facebook Journalism Project.  One platform partner at the top of everyone's minds, including Facebook's, is Snapchat. Indeed, Facebook's head of local partnerships Phillip Rather, speaking at the Borrell Associates' 2017 Local Online Advertising Conference Monday, said, "Snapchat had a very successful IPO. The other successful millennial app is Instagram." For now, working with Snapchat on Discover or another activation just isn't on the table for most small, low-budget publishers.  "I used to ask my kids about the media on there [Discover], and they were like, 'We never looked at that.'  But not sure if you heard, when Marty Baron last week said we're looking at it. You know if Marty's thinking it's important, we have to pay attention. Anyone who can bring down the Catholic Church is worth listening to," Coats said.  BONUS: Watch how global warming heats up the world from 1880-2016 Topics: Business, Facebook, facebook-journalism-project, newspapers, online media About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Pixabay Teaching machines to truly understand natural language has been one of the biggest challenges facing computer scientists working to advance artificial intelligence. But Google has made real progress in getting computers to look at language as more than just a bag of words, and these advancements are now making their way into its products. Google Translate, for example, is getting a technical makeover with the introduction of Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Starting today, you’ll notice vast improvements for any translations with Hindi, Russian and Vietnamese. This follows the first go at utilizing NMT in Translate last November, when English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish all saw the same improvement. “We have 103 languages overall, and our goal is to get all of them working with neural nets,” a Google spokesperson told the Observer. He added the rollout of the remaining languages will take place over many months, but exact timing is unknown because Google is simply launching each whenever it’s able to outperform the current system. Sometimes this will be a few at once, like with today’s introduction of improved Hindi, Russian and Vietnamese. Old versus new translation. Google Google Translate has always been kind of useful but ehhh overall. You could use it to get a sense of what something means in another language, but anything more than a simple phrase wouldn’t be an accurate translation. But with this new approach, translations on Google Search, translate.google.com, Google apps and, eventually, automatic page translations in Chrome will be significantly better and finally reflect natural language. “Neural translation is a lot better than our previous technology because we translate whole sentences at a time, instead of pieces of a sentence,” Barak Turovsky, product lead at Google Translate, wrote in a blog post announcing the news. Previously, Google relied on Phrase Based Machine Translation (PBMT), which breaks an input sentence into words and phrases to be translated independently. The new NMT, however, considers the entire sentence as an input and translates it as one. NMT uses deep neural networks, which enable a computer to understand situations it hasn’t seen before by learning, overtime, from other information. In this case, some of the training sets the program uses to learn are data from the Google Translate Community, where everyday users from all over the world translate sentences from their own languages and even rate translations. While all languages won’t make the switch for many months, the next batch is expected in a few weeks. Up NextShould Indie Authors Publish Exclusively With Amazon or Not?

The March 2017 update comes almost exactly one month after the February security patches were detailed. Google says that all of the vulnerabilities disclosed in its latest bulletin were revealed to its partners on February 6, 2017 or earlier. "Security patch levels of March 05, 2017 or later address all of these issues," it added. There are two separate security patch level strings in the new bulletin "to provide Android partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices", Google explained. However, it also pointed out that "supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the March 05, 2017 security patch level". That OTA update has begun to roll out today to Google devices; the latest OTA binary image files for supported Nexus and Pixel devices can be found here on Google's site, and the new factory images are available here. Details of the vulnerabilities and issues addressed in the latest security update follow below: 2017-03-01 security patch level—Vulnerability summary Security patch levels of 2017-03-01 or later must address the following issues.

Credit: Futuresource Consulting Ltd More like this Apple forfeits teachers' pet rep as U.S. share sinks Get to know the Premier 100 Class of 2017 The father of Google Apps and Chrome OS has a new vision -- and it revolves... Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Almost since its inception, Apple has had a strong presence in education. In the 1980s, schools weaned kids on the Apple IIe, including mine. From the 1990s on, it became all about Macs. You've probably seen the infamous picture of a classroom at the University of Missouri's Columbia School of Journalism with all the kids sitting with their MacBooks open. But that is changing, with use of iPads and MacBooks in U.S. schools hitting a new low last year, according to market research company Futuresource Consulting. The firm sad that in 2016 the number of iOS and MacOS devices in American classrooms fell to third place behind both Google- and Windows-powered devices. Of the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the U.S. in 2016, 58% were Chromebooks, up from 50% in 2015. Windows devices held steady at 22%, while iPads and Mac laptops fell from 25% in 2015 to just 19% last year. This is showing up in Apple's education revenue stream. According to IDC, Apple's share of the $7.35 billion in education spending in 2016 was $2.8 billion, down from $3.2 billion in 2015. Futuresource cited a strong combination of productivity tools via G-Suite, easy integration with third party platforms/tools, task management/distribution via Google Classroom and easy device management for the reasons Chromebooks are doing so well. The pricing also helped, with Chromebook prices reaching as low as $120 on certain projects. Despite its share remaining the same, Microsoft has made significant strides in the education market in recent months. This includes the launch of Microsoft Classroom, the cloud-based School Data Sync and a large number of integrations with popular third-party solutions. Microsoft also announced InTune for Education, a tool that effectively replicates the Google Management Console and allows IT admins to easily provision and set up large numbers of student devices remotely. On the hardware side, Microsoft recently announced partner devices that would be priced at $189 to target Chromebooks. "Microsoft has made huge strides in developing its education ecosystem offering in the past year, with major announcements on both the devices and platform side. To date however, these developments have not stopped Google's momentum within the U.S. K-12 market. Microsoft continues to face challenges to win back end-user mindshare," said Mike Fisher, associate director of education at Futuresource Consulting in a statement. Apple has not been sitting still. Last year it announced its Classroom app, Swift Playgrounds, and a number of other major education-focused feature updates in iOS 9.3, including the ability to share iPads. Futuresource predicts that 2-in-1 devices will be the next big trend in education, something Apple doesn't offer. Both Microsoft and Google and their respective OEM partners have announced a wide range of 2-in-1 products designed specifically for education and are expected to sell for under $300.

That is a fantastic question. Mobile by Jason Cipriani March 6, 2017 10:23 AM PST @MrCippy Just last week, Google announced its Google Assistant feature was making its way to Android devices running Android 6.0 Marshmallow and Android 7.0 Nougat. According to Google's announcement, the personal voice assistant that launched on the Pixel phone will slowly make its way to all devices in the US with English set as the device language. Awesome! Right? Yes, except the exact timing of when your device will actually receive the update is a giant mystery. While I can't tell you exactly when your phone will start using Google Assistant, you can take a few steps to ensure it will happen sooner than later. Join the Google Play Services beta by opening this link and clicking on "Become a Tester" using the same Google account linked to your Android device. Wait a few minutes, then open the Play Store and go to the My Apps section. In there should should be an update listed for Play Services. You may have to open the Beta tab and manually start the Play Services update. While you're in the Play Store checking for updates, make sure the Google app itself doesn't have any pending updates. With all of your apps updated, now you wait. To check for Assistant on your Android device, hold the home button down for a few seconds. One of these days, eventually, maybe, possibly... you will see a prompt asking you to begin the setup process for Google Assistant instead of Google Now opening.

Name: Subject: Message: March 2017 Android security updates now available for Pixel and Nexus devices Newsby John Callaham14 hours ago 11 554 8 Right on schedule, Google has released the March 2017 Android security patches for a number of the company’s Pixel and Nexus devices. If you own one of those devices, you can go ahead and download the factory images and OTA files right now directly from Google. Here’s the full list of factory images for Pixel and Nexus devices that are based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat: Google Pixel XL (NOF27B) Google Pixel XL (Rogers only) (NOF27C) Google Pixel (NOF27B) Google Pixel (Rogers only) (NOF27C) Google Pixel C (N4F26T) Nexus 6P (N4F26T) Nexus 6P (Verizon only) (NUF26N) Nexus 5X (N4F26T) Nexus 6 (N6F26U) LTE Nexus 9 (N4F26T) Wi-Fi Nexus 9 (N4F26T) In addition, there are also new Android 7.0 Nougat factory images to snag for the Nexus 6 (NBD92E), as well as the AT&T-only Nexus 6 (NBD92D). You can grab all the OTA download files for March 2017 as well. At the time of this writing, Google has not released any March 2017 factory images or OTA files for the Nexus Player. You can also check out the full Android security bulletin for March 2017. The post shows that this download fixes three critical vulnerabilities, along with eight high severity vulnerabilities, nine moderately severe vulnerabilities and one low vulnerability. The most critical security issue that has been fixed in this update would have allowed hackers to enable a remote code execution on devices, using methods such as emails, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. Google says it has seen no examples of any of these issues being exploited out in the wild. All Android partners were notified of the issues included in the March 2017 security update on February 6 or earlier.

Did you know these six things about the “Chinese Google”? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 6, 2017 at 1:37PM Many tech investors are probably familiar with the basic facts about Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) -- it's the biggest search engine in China, it has a growing ecosystem of cloud-based services like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, and it benefited greatly from Google's exit from the mainland Chinese market in 2010. Those are the bullet points in the growth story that boosted Baidu stock by nearly 1,500% over the past decade. But today, we'll take a look at six lesser-known facts about the "Chinese Google" which many investors might have overlooked. Image source: Author's screenshot. 1. CEO Robin Li cut his teeth in the U.S. tech industry After earning a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Buffalo, Baidu co-founder and CEO Robin Li worked at Dow Jones & Co.'s IDD Information Services and search company Infoseek in the 1990s. At IDD, Li developed the software for the online version of The Wall Street Journal and invented his patented Rankdex site-scoring algorithm for SEO rankings -- which currently powers Baidu's search engine. At Infoseek, Li created the image search function, which was subsequently used in Disney's Go.com network. After spending over five years at those two companies, Li returned to China and co-founded Baidu with investor Eric Xu in early 2000. 2. Baidu is developing driverless cars Like Google, Baidu believes that autonomous electric cars would be a natural extension of its data mining ecosystem. The company started testing out driverless cars on public roads in late 2015, and formed a driverless tech research center in Silicon Valley last April. Image source: Getty Images. Baidu is powering these vehicles with a combination of NVIDIA's automotive chips, HERE Maps, and its own AI algorithms. It's currently outsourcing production of these vehicles to Chinese automakers, and has declared that it will launch an autonomous shuttle bus by 2018. 3. It's beefing up its AI efforts For search engines like Baidu and Google, AI plays a key role in recognizing images, analyzing search patterns, and deciding what types of targeted ads will appeal to users. That's why Baidu hired a lot of top talent in AI -- its chief scientist Andrew Ng previously helmed the Google Brain AI project, and its new augmented reality chief Qi Lu was previously an AI specialist at Microsoft. Baidu hasn't been shy about challenging Google in the AI arms race. In January, it pitted its AI program against Google's AlphaGo AI in a series of facial and voice recognition tests in a live TV broadcast. 4. Baidu owns a small stake in Didi Chuxing Baidu previously invested in Uber's Chinese division, but Uber eventually retreated from the market due to tough competition -- especially from market leader Didi Chuxing. Uber sold its Chinese business to Didi last August, but retained a 17.7% stake in the new subsidiary. Baidu and Uber China's other shareholders received a 2.3% stake. That stake is small, but Baidu could boost it and more tightly integrate Didi's services into its O2O (online-to-offline) ecosystem. Didi could also play a key role in automating Baidu's driverless cars. 5. It owns a big part of Ctrip Baidu owns a 25% stake in Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP), the largest online travel agency (OTA) in China. For years, Ctrip was engaged in a price war with its primary competitor Qunar (NASDAQ:QUNR), which crushed both companies' margins. Baidu owned a 45% stake in Qunar, but it swapped that stake for a 25% stake in Ctrip in 2015 -- which effectively merged the two companies and ended the price war. That move also tethered Ctrip's services more tightly to Baidu's growing O2O ecosystem. 6. Baidu also sells smart bikes In late 2014, Baidu introduced DuBike, a bike equipped with a wide array of health and motion sensors which sync to a mobile app. It also features on-board navigation signals, which let riders follow directions without glancing at their phones, and lets riders share their routes with friends. To top it off, the entire system is powered by a rider's kinetic energy -- so the bike never needs to be recharged. Baidu's DuBike. Image source: Baidu. The key takeaway The heart of Baidu's business is still search-based advertising, but that could gradually change as its efforts in driverless cars, AI, its O2O ecosystem, and even smart bikes pay off. Therefore, investors should keep an eye on these adjacent efforts as the company trades blows with other tech titans -- like Tencent and Alibaba -- over the next few years.

Self-driving car technology is chugging along. Find out where we are today, and when we might actually be able to buy an autonomous car. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Mar 6, 2017 at 2:17PM Autonomous cars have been the buzz of the energy and tech sectors for years now, but how close are we as consumers to actually having fully autonomous cars in our driveways? In this week's episode of Industry Focus: Industrials, analyst Sean O'Reilly talks with Motley Fool senior auto specialist John Rosevear about the state of autonomous driving tech today, and when consumers will start to see the fruits of the industry's labors. Tune in to find out what the different levels of automation are and why they matter; where companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford (NYSE:F), and Fiat Chrysler fit into the story; where Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) alleged car project seem to be heading; and more. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on March 2, 2017. Sean O'Reilly: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. Today is Thursday, March 2, 2017, so we're talking about energy, materials, and industrials. I am your host, Sean O'Reilly, and joining me today via phone is Motley Fool senior auto specialist, Mr. John Rosevear. Good morning, John! John Rosevear: Good morning, Sean! How are you, today? O'Reilly: Extremely well. It's good to hear your voice. It's been awhile, a month or two, since we last had a podcast, and I missed you, buddy. Rosevear: Yeah, it's been a few weeks. O'Reilly: I had to get you in here to answer an all-important question. Rosevear: What's the question? O'Reilly: You're the only guy I know who can answer this for me. I hate driving, I live in D.C., it's very tiring, I want to know when I'm going to get my self-driving car. Rosevear: Well, it depends on what you mean by get, and really depends on what you mean by self-driving, [laughs] unfortunately. O'Reilly: I'm not touching the wheel in my driveway. Rosevear: Let's back up and define some terms here. This system of classification for things that assist drivers has become pretty universal. It was developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers in the U.S. The U.S. government has adopted it, other governments have adopted it, it's the way all automakers talk now. They categorize it in six levels that are helpfully numbered from zero to five. A level zero system, there's no automation, the driver does everything. This might even include warning systems like lane departure warning. But, the driver actually has to do everything. Level one is when you get some basic level of driver assistance, assistance that parallel parks for you, that kind of stuff. That's a level one system. O'Reilly: Does that include anti-lock brakes? I'm surprised that's on here. Rosevear: That's... O'Reilly: Eye of the beholder? Rosevear: The driver is still executing that. They count that as an intervention system. It's when the car decides to break for you that it starts to become assisted. These emergency stopping systems that they have now where the radar is on the front of the car, the levels one through five require some level of sensing what's going on around a car. So, yeah, these parallel park systems where the car spins the wheel for you and backs into the spot, that kind of thing, that's a level one. Level two is where it starts to get interesting. This is the system where you're on the highway and the traffic jam assist systems, maybe the earliest versions of Tesla's autopilot, where you can kind of take your hand off the wheel under certain circumstances, and the car will maintain and adjust its speed relative to the cars around to you, and it will keep itself in its lane. It's doing a little steering and a little accelerating and decelerating on its own. But there still has to be a human driver, the human driver has to be ready to grab the wheel. In fact, a lot of these systems require you to actually touch the wheel every minute or two, or something like that. Level three is when it kind of gets into self driving. This is a system that can drive under certain conditions, we might say highway driving, this is where Tesla's autopilot is starting to go, this is where some of the systems, GM's (NYSE:GM) Super Cruise that will come out on Cadillac soon, this is where it ends up, level three. O'Reilly: Super Cruise? [laughs]  Rosevear: That's what they call it. That's what they've been calling it for a few years, I'm not completely sure that's what they're going to call it when it comes to market. Anyway, the gist here is, it's self-driving until suddenly it isn't, the driver has to be ready to grab the wheel. That makes it a little tricky. We'll talk about that in a minute.  O'Reilly: The Motley Fool's Dan Sparks did that article about a year ago, he lives out in Colorado and he has a Tesla, how far did he get, 90 miles? I can't remember, but, I don't think he touched the wheel on the freeway with that thing. Rosevear: Tesla's official instructions with the original system where you're supposed to touch the wheel regularly, they considered it an advanced level two system. I think now they're into level three territory. The border here is a little bit fuzzy. The border to level four is not fuzzy. Level four is, the car is driving itself, period. It does not need you, but it's limited. Usually what it means is it's limited to an area that's been mapped, we say it's been geofenced. These systems tend to depend on very highly detailed 3D maps that show stuff that normal maps don't show, like exactly where the curb is within a couple inches and so forth, so the car can navigate precisely, especially on a city street. So, it's full self-driving, you don't ever have to touch a steering wheel, but it only works where the car has a map. Level five -- and we'll get back to this in a minute -- is the full-blown thing. It'll drive itself wherever you want under any conditions. If it's snowing, it'll go up a mountain, whatever, anything.  So, what we're talking about in the near future is level four, a car that will self-drive itself. This is coming soon. But it's limited by its maps. The idea is, gradually the maps will expand over time and you'll be able to drive -- O'Reilly: Are there cities that are being mapped right now? I'm actually surprised to hear this. Rosevear: Yeah, Pittsburgh is being mapped. This is where Uber is doing their testing, a lot of it. This is actually where Ford's new company they created as a start-up with a veteran of Uber and a veteran of Google's self-driving car project running it. This is basically Ford's software team for self-driving, and they're in Pittsburgh. There's been a lot of mapping done, interestingly, in Pittsburgh, because the artificial intelligence lab at Carnegie Mellon is the source of a lot of the research that went into this, so, a lot of the people are there. There's some mapping going on in San Francisco. I know GM's cruise automation subsidiary is doing testing of level four assistance in San Francisco, so they have mapping going on. Then, there are companies mapping all over the place. Tesla, I think, is automating some of this mapping with the sensors on their existing cars. A company called Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) is going to start doing mapping with sensors on their customers' cars, these are sensors for level two systems but they can help do the mapping for level four. This is going to start very soon, probably next year for Mobileye. There are private companies trying to do this, too, hoping to be able to sell the maps to the automakers or whoever. And, of course, the big wild card in this is, of course, Waymo. Google's been mapping for years and years. [laughs]  O'Reilly: You've seen the cars? They look ridiculous, they have the pole and they have the ball of cameras on the top, and they just drive around all these cities. That's how I can see what my dentist's office looks like from across the street. They're mapping cities with that, too? Rosevear: Yeah. I think everybody is. And it's not just mapping for Google Maps, it's mapping at a much more fine level of detail, where is the curb, where is the speed bump, and so forth, so the car knows what to expect as it's driving. The idea is, a map is a fallback from its sensors. If it's dark out, if it's foggy, if the lighter system is being buggy for whatever reason, you can kind of fall back on the maps. Because these are safety systems, there has to be redundancy built in. That's the thinking. O'Reilly: So, when is this stuff coming out? Rosevear: Good question. Tesla constantly does these upgrades, and they'll break into level four at some point. If I had to guess, I'd say 2019. But I don't know for sure. They may not even know absolutely for sure when they'll be ready to ship it. There's also an interesting question there that with their owners of their current models, they've been shipping stuff that maybe has some bugs still in it for the owners to bang on. And because Tesla owners tend to be early adopter types, they're mostly cool with that. As Tesla moves into the mass market with its upcoming Model 3, something else we've talked about, I don't know if they're going to tighten it up a little bit. They might. We'll see. But that might push that data off. But, anyway, this partnership of giant auto supplier Delphi, Mobileye, which is a machine vision specialist that has done a lot of work around-- O'Reilly: And but they are publicly traded, right? For our listeners. Rosevear: They are. The ticker there is MBLY. Look them up, because if you want a pure-play on self-driving, that's as close as it gets. The third company in this is Intel, which is designing the processors. They're working together on a level four system. We've talked about this before. They will have this available to any automaker who wants it by the end of 2019, they say. Now, the cars are going to ship in 2019. These things are incorporated as the cars are developed. So, probably late 2020, early 2021, people will be shipping cars with this system in, but those cars may not go to retail. [laughs]  O'Reilly: What?! Will they hang out and not do anything? [laughs]  Rosevear: Here's what, for instance, Ford is saying. Ford says, "We're going to mass produce a level four vehicle starting in 2021." Great. Then, they say, "Yeah, but we're not going to sell it at retail. This is going to be for car sharing use in cities and ride hailing services, Lyft and Uber and so on." It's because of the maps. They only want to sell it where they have the maps. CEO Mark Fields at Ford has said, "We're not even going to give it a steering wheel in this," so obviously it has to have the maps. Again, as the maps expand, there'll be more. Ford is saying right now that they think they'll have level four functionality in their retail vehicles 2025-ish. But they always say that, Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford, always says, "We throw out these dates, but it's always earlier than I expect." So, we'll see. Right now they're saying 2025. So, yeah, he says, "This stuff moves much faster than we expect." There's also some other stuff going on. The thing to emphasize here, I should back up a little bit, not all the automakers, not all the tech companies talk about what they're doing. There will be surprises here. This is just, what has been announced, what we have seen, what we generally know is coming. O'Reilly: Yeah, once you go public with something you get held to it in some capacity, and nobody wants to get egg on their face. Rosevear: Right. And GM originally said they'd launch Super Cruise in 2016 -- O'Reilly: They need to get a different name for that. [laughs]  Rosevear: Yeah, OK. They're a level three system. They came out a while back and said, "Wait a minute, we're not happy with it, we're going to do more work and make it more advanced. We're not going to set a firm date, but we think late 2017-18, probably around there." But again, they are not holding themselves to a firm date on that. In fact, they're not holding themselves to a firm date on a lot of this stuff. Mary Barra's thing is, "We'll ship it when it's ready." But what we do know is that GM is planning to actually start building a whole lot of level four vehicles, reportedly in the thousands. These will be the electric Chevy Volts. They will be fitted with prototype level four systems, and they will go into this massive test with Lyft in several different cities. So, when will you get your level four car?  O'Reilly: Which is why they invest in Lyft. Rosevear: Right. They own 9% of Lyft, it's something like that. It's a major investment, certainly, for GM. But, when do you get yourself a driving car? If you're in D.C., you might get one in several months from now or a year from now, when you summon Lyft with your smartphone and a Chevy Volt comes. Uber is already doing this on a tiny scale in Pittsburgh. They have 8 or 12 cars or something that are prototype self-driving vehicles in their fleet. With these things, there are two engineers on board. One is ready to grab the wheel and the other one is taking notes on everything that's happening with the system. And it may be the same deal with these GM Lyft self-driving vehicles. So it might not seem all that exciting because there's somebody in the front seat, but the car is driving itself, is the idea. This is a way to rack up a whole lot of test miles quickly, if you have a whole bunch of these things out there, you know? O'Reilly: Yeah. I can't wait to see all these Lyft driverless cars handle all the roundabouts in D.C., that'll be a treat.  Rosevear: Yeah, they'll teach them. We call them rotaries up here in New England, we have lots of them too. It'll be interesting to see how they handle Boston, which is colonial era streets in some areas of town. [laughs]  O'Reilly: Yeah, they're made for horses, not driverless cars. Rosevear: Yeah. Well, they were made to walk in, or cow paths, definitely not driverless cars. But, there's other stuff in here, too. The wild card is Waymo, which is the Alphabet subsidiary that used to be the Google Self-Driving Car Project and has now been set up as a company to go into business and commercialize this in some way. Who will partner with them? They had this little deal with Fiat Chrysler where Chrysler built them some Chrysler Pacifica minivans as test vehicles that took on their latest prototype system. They've been talking to Honda, reportedly. But of course, there's a certain view in the auto industry that a deal with Waymo is a deal with the devil because Google will want all the data. And then you're an Android phone maker, and Google's making all the money. That is a great fear. I think every auto CEO in the world is mindful of the example of the phone industry. [laughs] They don't want to give up the data. I think that is actually a lot of the selling proposition of the Delphi-Mobileye system, this is a system developed within the established auto industry supplier structure. We'll share the maps among our fellow automakers and so forth, but we're not selling the data to Google. [laughs]  O'Reilly: What do you think has been going on there? Correct me if I'm wrong, but Google has those tiny little white go-kart looking driverless cars for years. The laymen, we haven't gotten a hint of them trying to make a buck off of them at all. It's weird. Rosevear: They hired, a while back, and executive named John Krafcik. He had been the president of TrueCar, and before that, he had been in the business for years. He was with several automakers, in management capacities, executive capacities. He's a guy who knows the business, a good guy, smart guy. His job is to lead Waymo and find a way to bring this stuff to market somehow. He's been out there talking to automakers. He actually did a really big presentation at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January -- I was going to say last month, but it's March now. He was talking about where their system is and so forth. They have a solid prototype level four system. I think he was there, in part, fishing for automakers who might want to have conversation. It's possible those conversations have happened and nobody is talking about them. The ones that have made it into the media are Honda and, of course, Fiat Chrysler, which is a much more overt thing, because the latest test vehicles are all Chryslers. O'Reilly: We don't have this as a note, so feel free to tell me you don't know a ton about this, but I'm sure all of our listeners are on the tip of their tongues with this, they want to hear, what is Apple up to? They have that big plan, and I've got a push notification from The Wall Street Journal a year ago that Apple was going to build a car within the decade, blah blah, then they pulled back on it, they're doing testing again. What is Tim Cook scheming right now? Rosevear: Good question. Yeah, I remember when that Wall Street Journal thing came out. O'Reilly: You got the notification too, I'm sure. Rosevear: I did, and I actually poked a few sources and ended up writing a big piece for The Motley Fool first thing on Saturday morning after that broke, sort of, what does this mean, can they actually do it, that kind of thing. And the answer was, Apple has so much money that, of course, they could start a car company, the question is, do they want to? O'Reilly: Yeah, I remember you talking about that. Rosevear: Right. They can throw money at it. The full boat, it's about $10 billion to get to where Tesla is where they have a factory and they're banging out cars and it's really high level of quality and so forth. Full boat. That's Tim Cook's lunch money these days. [laughs] Their cash load is unbelievable. They can do anything. The question is, would they want to? The margins in the car business, by Apple's standards, are pretty lousy. A luxury car business might make an operating margin of 10-12%. If you're Porsche, you might make 16%. That's kind of the upper limit. O'Reilly: So, is it possible that Google and Apple wind up dropping the brains in these cars and calling it a day? Google already, they must have tons of data on these cars operating. Rosevear: Google has made it clear, John Krafcik came out and said, "We're not building cars, we're not going to build a car factory, we are not building cars. We're looking for partnerships, we are not building cars." Apple hasn't said anything, of course. Officially, this program doesn't even exist. But the word was, a lot of the people who might have been on the actual build-a-car side of the business have been let go. People working on electric self-driving cars are in very hot demand these days. So, none of these people are wanting for employment. But it was thought that a lot of those folks were let go, and they really ratcheted down the ambitions of the program. They may be aiming to do something where they come out, like Waymo, and offer a system that Apple-izes a self driving car built by somebody else. It's possible that they will find an automaker to partner with, and maybe offer that as a deluxe ride hailing option. My thought when they were originally talking about this was that they were going to build the deluxe Apple version of robot Uber, where it's a little bit more money but it's a nicer car, and it recognizes all your Apple devices and it's this seamless experience, it sees your iPhone and it automatically sets your seat and your climate and your music and everything else and all this stuff, it takes exactly where you want to go, and it's just a subscription model, $500 a month for the Apple Car service. That's where I thought they were going to go. Others disagreed. Some of my fellow Fools who are also very close watchers of this kind of technology and particularly close watchers of Apple thought they might actually build a car for retail Tesla-style. O'Reilly: Cool. We're about out of time, John. I want to give you the last word. When am I magically going to get my driverless car in my driveway? Rosevear: If you want a Tesla, you might get it by the end of the decade. If you want a car from one of the bigger automakers, it's probably a few years beyond that. Somebody may surprise us and have a level four car out by 2020 or 2021 that has a fairly big map. But I'm thinking it might be over the next couple years after that that these start to be available for retail. I suspect the first ones that come out, it will be an expensive option on a luxury car. O'Reilly: Awesome. John, I cannot thank you enough, once again, for your time. Rosevear: It's always a pleasure. O'Reilly: I have to imagine that as this continues to ramp up, this will not be our last show about this topic.  Rosevear: Oh, heavens no. We'll be talking about this for several years to come. It's a big deal. O'Reilly: Awesome. Well, have a good day, John! Thank you, again! Rosevear: All right. Take care, Sean! O'Reilly: Bye. That's it for us, folks.

Google released an API design guide recently. I'll be adding the design guide to the list of examples I have in my API design research. The Google API design guide is pretty straightforward in its purpose, with a goal of helping "developers design simple, consistent, and easy-to-use networked APIs" — but I thought it was noteworthy that they were also looking to help "converging designs of socket-based RPC APIs with HTTP-based REST APIs." gRPC and Protocol Buffers have been on my task list to learn more about for a while now, but without any projects at scale, it's probably not a task I'll find much time for anytime soon. I'll try to carve off more time to learn how folks like Google are doing it through their guides and storytelling. One thing I did know, which Google reinforces, is that "many companies use socket-based RPC APIs to carry most network traffic, which can be orders of magnitude higher than public REST APIs." I like their approach that "both RPC APIs and HTTP REST APIs are needed for various reasons. Ideally, an API platform should provide the best support for all APIs." They also note the following: "This Design Guide explains how to apply REST principles to API designs independent of programming language, operating system, or network protocol. It is NOT a guide solely to creating REST APIs." I like this because we are getting past the notion that API design is simply about REST--it is clearly evolving to be more about getting the work done than any single philosophy or dogma. In addition to encouraging more API providers to craft an API design guide for their companies using API Stylebook and to share their API design guides with the public, I will also be encouraging companies to think beyond just REST when they consider their API design best practices. I'm hoping that more companies will continue to do the hard work of getting their API design house in order because that means they can also begin to think about best practices when it comes to API deployment, management, testing, and the other stops along the API lifecycle. Is iPaaS solving the right problems? Not knowing the fundamental difference between iPaaS and iPaaS+ could cost you down the road. Brought to you in partnership with Liaison Technologies.

Google is making it more difficult for malware to worm its way into your computer. Google announced on its Security blog that it’s broadening the protections given by Safe Browsing for macOS devices. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY It’s combating malware on two fronts: First, it’s working to eliminate unwanted ad injections — which are ads that appear in places and sites where there shouldn’t be any. Second, it’s getting rid of Settings Overrides — which typically hijack your default search engine or homepage. The changes will roll out by March 31. Starting in April, you’ll see this screen if you come across an unsafe site on the internet: Credit: Google. Malware isn’t as common on macOS as it is on Windows, but it does exist. Earlier this year, security researchers discovered two new viruses that exploited vulnerabilities long known among Windows users.

Cam Bunton6 March 2017Phones Pocket-lint 4.0 stars £550 For Nice build, big scale, colourful and high-resolution AMOLED display, camera is great, fast-charging tech Against No Google Play by default will be tricky for casual users, no capacitive buttons or softkeys in the software Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment You often hear the age-old rhetoric that China is taking over the world, and nowhere is that more clear than in the smartphone market. Companies like Huawei, Oppo and Vivo are now in the top five global smartphone vendors. And for good reason: they're making some top product. One company you may not be aware of is Meizu. Like Xiaomi - another popular Chinese smartphone maker - it's known for producing great quality hardware at relatively affordable prices. The Meizu Pro 6 Plus is the company's biggest and best phone, yet still costs considerably less than an iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel XL or Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. But, is it a great phone?  Meizu Pro 6 Plus review: Design 155.6 x 77.3 x 7.3mm 158g in weight All metal chassis with curved edges Like so many other China-made Android phones, the design is immediately familiar. But then again, when it comes to premium phones, the current choices for staying on trend are limited. You can either use an all-metal back and be forced to have antenna bands running along it (like the iPhone), or go with glass (like a Samsung Galaxy). Pocket-lint On the whole, Meizu has built a phone that's both attractive to look at and pleasant to hold in the hand. In many ways, it reminds us of the similarly designed (and sized) Oppo F1 plus. It's roughly the same width as an iPhone 7 Plus, too, so it's still quite big - but it does have a larger screen, making its overall smaller footprint an impressive feat.  The metal back panel is anodised - our review unit in gold, but other colours are available - with antenna bands at the top and bottom. They're not your typical completely straight bands though, as they're curved to match the curves of the phone's edges. The camera sits near the top, placed centrally above an unusual LED flash ring (which is made up of multiple dual-tone LED lights) that surrounds the laser focus sensor. On the front, there's a single pill-shaped home button which also acts as the fingerprint scanner. Unusually, there are no capacitive buttons joining the home button, and there are no typical home, back or multitasking virtual buttons on the screen either. Pocket-lint As far as other ports, switches and buttons go, they're in the places you'd expect to find them. The bottom edge features the USB Type-C port, the loudspeaker grille and the 3.5mm jack. The top edge has nothing except the noise-cancelling microphone, while the power button and volume rocker live on the right side of the phone, and the dual SIM tray lives on the left edge. Although it's not a one-handed device by any stretch of the imagination (or your grip), the Pro 6 is impressively slim for a device with such a big screen and powerful innards.  Meizu Pro 6 Plus review: All the pixels 5.7-inch Quad HD (2560 x 1440) display Super AMOLED 1000:1 contrast ratio 3D touch-like technology As smartphone screens go, the 5.7-inch display on the Meizu Pro 6 Plus is definitely at the larger end of the scale. And it's when looking at it that we get our first hint that Meizu really is going after flagship territory with this beast. It's a Quad HD resolution panel built using Super AMOLED technology (similar to Samsung's best phones). It's big, bright and colourful, while boasting a 1000:1 contrast ratio - meaning those blacks look really inky and dark and combine well with the bright saturated colours. Pocket-lint One of things that's quite striking about the Pro 6 Plus' screen is how clear and bright it is. It doesn't seem to matter what angle you're looking at the phone from, the content just pops, like there's no interface between you and what's on display. It's just you and your movie or game. It's genuinely beautiful.  As a bonus, Meizu has built in a pressure-sensitive layer into the screen to enable 3D Touch-like features, giving you the option to press hard on app icons to bring up bespoke quick actions. In a lot of ways, this is similar to the latest iPhones; giving you the ability to send a quick text from the messages icon, or create a new contact from the dialler icon, among others. Meizu Pro 6 Plus review: Exynos inside Exynos 8890 processor, 4GB RAM 3,400mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 USB 3.1 support Depending on whether you buy the 64GB or 128GB version of the Pro 6 you'll get different internal specifications. For instance, while both come with 4GB RAM, the lower storage model's Exynos 8890 processor is clocked at a slightly lower speed to the more capacious 128GB version. Likewise, the higher storage model has a slightly more powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) too. Pocket-lint Regardless of which one you end up going with, Samsung's Exynos 8890 processor inside is one of the most powerful chips available on the market. In fact, this is the same chip that powers the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. In short: it's no slouch. In daily use it launches apps and videos without showing any signs of effort. It's fast, fluid and rarely stutters or pauses for a breath. Likewise, unlocking the phone using the home button's fingerprint sensor is virtually instant, providing you don't get the unmatched fingerprint message, which did happen a couple of times a day.  Providing the audio chops is a DAC capable of producing 32-bit/192kHz audio which is designed to produce great sounding music without consuming a lot of power. Not many phones are able to deliver high-end audio such as this, so it's good to see support for those high-end music aficionados. Meizu Pro 6 Plus preview: Battery life Backing all of this processing power is a 3,400mAh battery, which is enough juice to get you through a full day without issue, but not likely to get you far into a second day unless you're a very light user. For those times when the battery is running really low and you know you won't make it to a power outlet for a while, there's a software feature which lets you enter a super mode to dramatically reduce battery consumption. It limits you to just phone and text messages and switches to a simple black and white theme.  Meizu claims that its battery is long-lasting and can survive up to twice as long as regular batteries, with a lifetime of over 900 cycles. Obviously we can't test this, having only owned the phone for around a month (at the time of writing). Pocket-lint Once it depletes, the Quick Charge 3.0 enabled power adapter can fill it speedily. Its USB cable has been designed specifically to deal with high wattage power transfer up to 60W (MacBook charger territory). The phone has short circuit protection to ensure it doesn't overheat or short circuit, as an additional security measure. As well as all that, it's worth mentioning that the phone supports USB 3.1 via a USB Type-C port giving you data transfer speeds up to 5Gbps. Matching that speediness, the fingerprint sensor on the front is claimed to be one of the fastest out there, and our initial testing does nothing to dispel those claims. The phone unlocks within the blink of an eye. Well, more the touch of a finger. Meizu Pro 6 Plus review: Flyme to the moon Flyme 5.2 software Runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow No Google Play services out of box As is the case for most Chinese smartphone manufacturers, Meizu's big flagship phone runs a heavily skinned custom version of Android, called Flyme. It's in version 5.2 currently, which uses Android 6.0 Marshmallow as its foundation, but you wouldn't know it from looking at it. Some basic core elements of Android just aren't there initially. For instance, there are no on-screen virtual home, back or multitasking buttons despite the fact that there aren't any capacitive ones. Instead, to go back you have to touch lightly on the home button, and to launch the multi-tasking screen you have to swipe upwards from the bottom of the display. Pocket-lint It also doesn't ship with Google staple apps and services, so there's no Play Store, Google Maps or anything else. However, there is a way to manually install them by downloading the Google Installer APK. You can do this from the preinstalled "app store", or by using other unofficial sources, like APKMirror. This took a few goes to get right and required resetting and rebooting the phone more times than we would have liked. However, once we got that installed, we were able to download and install all of our favourite and most-used apps. That's one of the limitations of a Chinese company that hasn't fully adapted to the out-the-box UK experience. As you'd expect, there's also no app drawer, which means all of your apps live on the home screen. That means either arranging everything into folders, or just downloading a third-party launcher for a more traditional Android look and feel. Similar to many other modern 'droid phone, the Flyme software has a phone management app for optimisation. You can use it to perform virus checking, RAM clearing to kill background apps, delete old and useless files, and so forth. Pocket-lint There's also a handy toolbox app that gives you instant access to things like a compass, spirit level, flashlight and ruler. They're obviously not as useful or reliable as their genuine physical counterparts, but useful to have in a pinch when you don't have your trusty Stanley measuring tape to hand.  Meizu Pro 6 Plus review: Camera happy 12MP Sony sensor 10 LED flash ring 4-axis OIS (optical stabilisation) The Pro 6 Plus' flagship claims are bolstered even further by its camera capabilities. Images are captured by a 12-megapixel Sony sensor with large 1.25μm pixels to produce great shots in low-light conditions. Combine that with the 4-axis optical image stabilisation, f/2.0 aperture and 6-element lens, and you should see great results, and you should be able to snap them quickly thanks to the laser-guided autofocus. Pocket-lint Meizu has also built-in what it calls the "latest generation high-performance ISP image processor" and paired the camera with a unique dual tone flash ring made up of 10 individual LEDs. In other words, you should be able to shoot smooth, noise- and blur-free shots with great colour regardless of the lighting conditions. What all of this means is that you can take great looking shots in most circumstances. Focusing and capture times are virtually instant, and the plethora of useful camera features and modes should be enough to keep anyone occupied.  Like so many other phone cameras there's a manual shooting mode too. This gives you control over shutter speed, ISO sensitivity, manual focus, exposure compensation, saturation, contrast and white balance. There's also the usual collection of video and still modes like panorama, beauty mode and slow-mo as well as some more unusual ones.  There's Macro mode for taking close-up shots of small objects, GIF mode for creating animated GIFs and even a Light Field mode which takes a series of photos in one with the focus set at different focal lengths.  Pocket-lint End results, in most instances, are nicely balanced and naturally coloured. Low-light scenes don't pose too much trouble, with very little image noise creeping in unless things get really dark. It doesn't struggle to focus, unless an object is really, really close to the lens. All in all, it's a great camera.  Verdict In the Pro 6, Meizu clearly shows why Chinese manufacturers need to be taken seriously. It's a quality product with only a few shortcomings.  The biggest concern for many regular consumers will be the lack of Google Play Services as standard. While you can install them yourself with a bit of know-how, that's an extra step that's just beyond the comfort zone of many casual smartphone users who'll want something that works out of the box. Oh, and the lack of capacitive buttons and softkeys might be seen as an oddity by many. Apart from that, Meizu has built a phone that competes with the best of them in virtually every regard, and does it at a lower price. A company to watch for the future? We think so. Alternatives to consider... Pocket-lint OnePlus 3T Its screen is slightly smaller at 5.5-inches, and features a less pixel-dense 1080p full HD display, but as an overall experience the OnePlus 3T is one of the most complete phones out there. It's solid, charges really quickly and is a smooth, fast performer that costs even less than the Meizu. Read the full review: OnePlus 3T review: The best mid-price phone, now with Nougat sweetness Pocket-lint Google Pixel XL As big phones go, the Pixel XL is one of the best out there, if not the best. It runs the latest, purest version of Android Nougat, has a beautiful display and a fantastic camera. It's a little pricey, but we think it's worth it.  Read full review: Google Pixel XL review: Android's heavyweight champion Pocket-lint iPhone 7 Plus If you want a reliable, smooth and consistent performer with software updates for years, a wide selection of the best apps available from a company that offers brilliant customer support, you can't go wrong with an iPhone.

Google caught spreading fake news over the weekend Is Barack Obama planning a coup? The answer, according to Google this weekend, could have been yes. Internet Services by Katie Collins 7 March 2017 4:54 am AEDT @katiecollins Google Home spouts crazy talk with fake news in answers The smart speaker is criticized for spreading conspiracy theories about President Obama and other untrue statements as part of its spoken search results. by Bridget Carey 2:10 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Don't believe everything you read on the internet. Google acknowledged Monday reports that it inadvertently allowed false information to spread over the weekend. "Unfortunately, there are instances when we feature a site with inappropriate or misleading content," a Google spokeswoman said in a statement. On Sunday, chatter about the tech giant spreading inaccurate information and conspiracy theories through a search function called "Featured Snippets" bubbled up on social media, highlighting reports from TheOutline.com and Searchengineland. You may have seen the Featured Snippets displayed in a box at the top of Google search results or heard them parroted by your Google Home device when you input a query. Over the weekend, Featured Snippets was giving a rather funky answer to the question: "Is Obama planning a coup?" The Obama is, of course, former President Barack Obama. "According to details exposed in Western Centre for Journalism's exclusive video, not only could Obama be in bed with the communist Chinese, but Obama may in fact be planning a communist coup d'état at the end of his term in 2016," Google would reply. The spread of false information -- aka fake news -- has been attracting attention recently though it's a problem as old as the internet itself. Still, it was the 2016 US presidential campaign that transformed "fake news" into a hot-button topic, with claims that fake news reports influenced the outcome of the election. Since the election, President Donald Trump has used the phrase in attacks on mainstream media. At the center of the storm last year was Facebook, a network where people can easily share fake news. The company has since promised to crack down on the problem. But it's not just Facebook. In this specific instance, Google fixed the problem as soon as it was alerted to the result. But people are actively trying to find other examples. If you do happen across what you believe to be a Featured Snippet containing false information, you can click on the feedback link directly underneath to flag the problem to Google. Spreading false information is not Google's intention. The company has been trying to crack down on it. Last month, Google teamed up with Facebook to combat the problem in France and Germany, both of which face upcoming elections. So what went wrong over the weekend? According to Google, the Featured Snippets search function relies on algorithms to automatically provide a match to a search query, pulling in text from third-party sites. Most of the time this provides people with a helpful summary or answer to their question. But the algorithm doesn't always discriminate between reputable and disreputable sources. "When we are alerted to a Featured Snippet that violates our policies, we work quickly to remove them, which we have done in this instance," Google said. "We apologize for any offense this may have caused." Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility. Special Reports: CNET's in-depth features in one place.

Recommended for You AI’s PR Problem Amazon’s $150 Million Typo Is a Lightning Rod for a Big Cloud Problem Moscow Billboard Targets Ads Based on the Car You’re Driving How Google Street View Images Reveal the Demographic Makeup of the U.S. The Department of Defense Wants to Double Down on Renewables In the wake of the U.S. presidential election, much public ire was directed at Facebook for failing to combat the rising tide of fake news. Whether or not it made any impact on the result of the election—which is incredibly difficult to ascertain—the sustained hand-wringing had an effect: the social network announced it would work with third-party fact-checkers to tag some posts as Disputed News. This week, it appears to have come good on its promise, with some users reporting that the tool is now in use. The system runs suspicious posts past the fact-checking organizations Snopes, Politifact, ABC News, and FactCheck.org for analysis. If at least two of them contest facts within an article, users will see it tagged as “Disputed by Third Party Fact Checkers.” Then they can make up their own minds. Problem solved? Not quite. Misinformation is still here—and now it seems that Google is the one that will happily allow its algorithms to serve it up to you. Over the weekend, the Outline pointed out that Google’s Featured Snippet tool doesn’t behave quite as you may hope. Usually, the feature is designed to answer a question quickly when you use Google’s search engine or AI voice assistant. But the answers are mined from high-ranking Web pages, and aren’t necessarily correct. According to the Outline, snippets have variously: claimed that President Warren Harding was once a member of the Ku Klux Klan (false); suggested that Barack Obama may have planned a coup d'etat (still waiting); and blurted out some rather unsavory views on whether or not women are evil. In each case, the answers are taken from websites that many people would not usually turn to for trustworthy information. On the Web, Google does at least allow you to find out where the information came from and report it if you think it’s incorrect or inappropriate. And, according to the BBC, some of these specific slips have now been fixed. But Google would be loathe to switch off its Featured Snippet tool, particularly on its voice assistant, altogether. As our own Tom Simonite has pointed out in the past, the company sees its search abilities as a big differentiating factor between its own Assistant AI and the likes of Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. It’s simply better practiced at scouring the Web for answers. But, clearly, when the Internet is constituted with content spanning the full spectrum of veracity, it won’t always get it right. In fact, Google itself might become home to more of the questionable content that it serves up. YouTube has always been a  source of weird and wonderful conspiracy theories about, say, the moon landing having never happened. But last week Buzzfeed pointed out that the video site is increasingly home to  what  it calls “right-leaning conspiracy and revisionist historical content,” such as suggestions that the Sandy Hook shooting didn’t result in deaths, or that Michelle Obama is, in fact, a man. The arguments leveled at Facebook over its fake news—namely, that if you show people enough false content over and over, they will get confused and potentially start to believe some of it—can be equally leveled at YouTube. As NPR reiterated over the weekend, algorithms decide what video to suggest you watch next on YouTube, so watching just one questionable clip can easily lead you down a rabbit warren of similar content. Next thing you know, you might actually be questioning Michelle Obama’s gender. To be sure, filtering out content is hugely problematic. There are blurred lines here between opinion and misinformation, and censorship at the cost of free speech is clearly unacceptable. Mark Zuckerberg is all too aware of that fact, having called the issues at stake “complex, both technically and philosophically.” At this point—and we didn’t necessarily expect to be saying this—Facebook’s solution looks like a good first step. By flagging content, users can exercise their own healthy skepticism, without the social network having to tackle the thorny concept of simply yanking it from a feed altogether.

FILE PHOTO | NMG  Betting companies were among the top Internet searches in Kenya last month, reflecting the growing gambling craze in the country. Google on Monday listed February’s top searches as SportPesa, Elitebet, Adbet, Betin, Betika, Kwikbet and Betway. “Google Search Trends that indicate search patterns over a period of time reveal that the betting craze continues to develop among Kenyans,” said the tech company in a statement. The second most popular search item among Kenyans on Google was the newly opened Two Rivers Mall. The late Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua, who died on February 24, was the third most popular search query. Kenyans were also interested in Eunice Njeri, a popular gospel musician who recently annulled her marriage. Valentine’s Day was another top query as was the English Premier league. Excitement over the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport’s gaining a direct link to the United States was reflected in Google searches for Kenya Airways.  Also Read Corporate NewsBank of Africa seeks arrest of Bosnians in Sh131m loan case Corporate NewsShelter Afrique picks Sierra Leonean as CFO The online obsession with betting comes even as legislators target the betting companies in Kenya with tough regulation. Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo, has proposed a law that would restrict where betting and gaming companies can advertise. The proposed legislation will see the firms rely on phone applications and betting websites. Sports betting firms have been raking in billions of shillings in Kenya over the past three years. The Kenya Revenue Authority last month said it had collected Sh4.7 billion from betting firms over the past three years. The taxman is hoping to up revenue from the firms through new laws that came into force at the beginning of the year. advertisement In the Headlines BAT Kenya names new managing director By VICTOR JUMA  Homa Bay duo’s investment of Sh10m loan in bakery pays off By BARACK ODUOR  30 minutes ago Kenyan investors to gain from EU green energy fund By NEVILLE OTUKI  39 minutes ago Helb now goes after guarantors in new quest to recover bad loans By ANNIE NJANJA  50 minutes ago Corporate News Money & Markets Stocks Economy & Politics Kenya Africa World Opinion & Analysis Life Society & Success Magazines BDLife Digital Business Enterprise Shipping n-soko About us Contact us Digital Editions Syndication Help Privacy Policy Terms

Google caught spreading fake news over the weekend Is Barack Obama planning a coup? The answer, according to Google this weekend, could have been yes. Internet Services by Katie Collins March 6, 2017 9:54 AM PST @katiecollins Google Home spouts crazy talk with fake news in answers The smart speaker is criticized for spreading conspiracy theories about President Obama and other untrue statements as part of its spoken search results. by Bridget Carey 2:10 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Don't believe everything you read on the internet. Google acknowledged Monday reports that it inadvertently allowed false information to spread over the weekend. "Unfortunately, there are instances when we feature a site with inappropriate or misleading content," a Google spokeswoman said in a statement. On Sunday, chatter about the tech giant spreading inaccurate information and conspiracy theories through a search function called "Featured Snippets" bubbled up on social media, highlighting reports from TheOutline.com and Searchengineland. You may have seen the Featured Snippets displayed in a box at the top of Google search results or heard them parroted by your Google Home device when you input a query. Over the weekend, Featured Snippets was giving a rather funky answer to the question: "Is Obama planning a coup?" The Obama is, of course, former President Barack Obama. "According to details exposed in Western Centre for Journalism's exclusive video, not only could Obama be in bed with the communist Chinese, but Obama may in fact be planning a communist coup d'état at the end of his term in 2016," Google would reply. The spread of false information -- aka fake news -- has been attracting attention recently though it's a problem as old as the internet itself. Still, it was the 2016 US presidential campaign that transformed "fake news" into a hot-button topic, with claims that fake news reports influenced the outcome of the election. Since the election, President Donald Trump has used the phrase in attacks on mainstream media. At the center of the storm last year was Facebook, a network where people can easily share fake news. The company has since promised to crack down on the problem. But it's not just Facebook. In this specific instance, Google fixed the problem as soon as it was alerted to the result. But people are actively trying to find other examples. If you do happen across what you believe to be a Featured Snippet containing false information, you can click on the feedback link directly underneath to flag the problem to Google. Spreading false information is not Google's intention. The company has been trying to crack down on it. Last month, Google teamed up with Facebook to combat the problem in France and Germany, both of which face upcoming elections. So what went wrong over the weekend? According to Google, the Featured Snippets search function relies on algorithms to automatically provide a match to a search query, pulling in text from third-party sites. Most of the time this provides people with a helpful summary or answer to their question. But the algorithm doesn't always discriminate between reputable and disreputable sources. "When we are alerted to a Featured Snippet that violates our policies, we work quickly to remove them, which we have done in this instance," Google said. "We apologize for any offense this may have caused." Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility. Special Reports: CNET's in-depth features in one place.

Google celebrated by rounding up the most successful media so far. Single store Google officially unveiled the Play Store on March 6 2012. It replaced the company's disparate selection of Android apps for purchasing individual kinds of content. The Android Market, Google Music and Google eBookstore were combined into the all-encompassing Play Store, giving you a single destination for every kind of media. At launch, 450,000 apps and games were available. That has now grown to "millions" of apps, alongside 40 million songs and five million books. It's all available from the unified Play Store app installed on Android phones, tablets, watches and now Chromebook laptops. Top content Images of upcoming Google Play Store redesign, October 2015 Kirill Grouchnikov [Google+] To mark its fifth birthday, Google has released a new set of top five lists for the top-performing media on the Play Store to date. Leading the apps chart is Facebook, followed by Facebook Messenger and Pandora Radio. Instagram and Snapchat come in fourth and fifth respectively. In the games list, Candy Crush Saga, Subway Surfers and Temple Run 2 hold the podium positions, followed by Despicable Me and Clash of Clans. The Interview is the top-selling movie, leading Frozen and Deadpool in second and third place respectively. Star Wars: The Force Awakens comes fourth with Guardians of the Galaxy in fifth. The albums chart sees Adele's 25, Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP2 (Deluxe) and Taylor Swift's 1989 gain the top spots, with Drake's If You're Reading This It's Too Late and Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly coming in fourth and fifth respectively. "Distribution platform" The Play Store was developed as a rival to Apple's rapidly growing App Store. Five years later, the two ecosystems remain the biggest in the world. Overall, Google's is larger but Apple manages to make more money. Google's best apps of 2015 collection [UK edition] Google As a content destination, Apple has gained the upper hand as it's been selling digital content for over a decade. Google is pioneering in emerging sectors of digital entertainment though, including virtual reality. The Play Store is expanding to access new frontiers of technology, reaching additional users along the way. "In five years, we’ve grown to more than 1 billion active users in 190 countries," said Google. "And with millions of apps, 40 million songs, 5 million books, and more movies than ever, there’s so much to explore. Google Play has also become an important distribution platform for developers to build their global audience." "Just the beginning" Evolution of the Android Market to 2015 Google Play refresh Kirill Grouchnikov [Google+] In its five-year tenure, the Play Store has gradually evolved through a selection of interfaces, flattening over time to meet industry trends. The last overhaul came in 2015 when the app was overhauled to use Google's Material Design language. Less minor revisions are frequently released, such as an update rolling out this week that includes an improved app download progress page. Five years after abandoning the restrictive Android Market and its plethora of multimedia apps, Google said it's only just "beginning" with the Play Store. As the store comes to more Chromebooks and begins to fill with virtual reality content, the company is pitching Play as the go-to media solution.

But an artificial intelligence (AI) program owned by Alphabet, Google's parent company, may be able to do it much, much faster. DeepMind, an artificial intelligence company also owned by Alphabet is working to tell the difference between healthy and cancerous tissue as well as discover if metastasis has occured. "Metastasis detection is currently performed by pathologists reviewing large expanses of biological tissues. This process is labour intensive and error-prone," explained DeepMind in a white paper outlining the study.

"Our method leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and obtains state-of-the-art results on the Camelyon16 dataset in the challenging lesion-level tumour detection task." Such high-level image recognition was first developed for Google's driverless car program, in order to help the vehicles scan for road obstructions.

The software only looks for one thing - cancerous tissue - and is not able to pick up any irregularities that a human doctor could spot.

How about CTA buttons? Columnist Drew Eastmead outlines five best practices to keep in mind when you're adding content to your company’s website or blog. Drew Eastmead on March 6, 2017 at 12:54 pm More If you are charged with adding content to your organization’s website, then you know that creating a new blog post or web page can require significant time and effort. Do you dread the process of working in your content management system (CMS)? Do you know what to spend time on? Are you paying attention to the right details and optimization strategies? It may take a writer several hours to create a content piece, and too often, we see that the same writer or editor rushes through the final portion — inputting the content into your CMS, such as WordPress, and hitting “publish.” That hasty approach — and the repetitive nature of creating new pages or blog posts — leads to sloppy work, which can drastically reduce the chances of your content being successful. I’ve seen it on almost every website I diagnose — there are crucial, but easy, elements that a non-web developer can add to their toolbox to make them a more effective content marketer. These are the top five easy fixes and best web practices that are commonly overlooked by those who add content to their company’s website or blog. 1. Add H2s or subheads within your post The bold subhead you just read above is coded as <H2>. It’s a simple designation that signifies to Google that this is an important component of this page. While it isn’t as critical and all-encompassing as my <H1> headline, you’re telling Google’s spiders to use the H2 as a stepping stone toward understanding the context of your page. This is easily the most consistently missed opportunity I see across websites in all industries. Their blog posts are simply walls of text with plain-looking paragraphs. By not using subheads, you’re telling Google that essentially everything under your <H1> is of equal importance. Adding H2s (and H3s) accomplishes many things: H2s provide context to a reader, so they can quickly scan a piece of content. Subheads make your piece visually more appealing by adding white space. Most importantly, H2s are a valuable search engine optimization (SEO) tool that can help your content rank for keywords that aren’t necessarily in your <H1> headline. Here’s how to label a subhead as an H2 in WordPress. Highlight your text and find the drop-down menu in the toolbar: 2. Promote your new content on your website’s home page or section pages Do your blog posts live on their own island? Usually, there are five ways you can find a new piece of content on a website: External marketing (social media, email, etc.) Organic search (through Google or Bing) Internal search on your website Clicking directly to the page, section or blog where the content now lives Clicking on a module or image that promotes the new content piece The fifth way is an underutilized method of making your content more visible. Depending on your website setup, your new content may automatically be highlighted in a “Latest Posts” or “From the Blog” feature on your home page. But if you have the option to manually highlight content — from your home page or a “Resources” section — don’t forget that this, too, can help draw out valuable content, whether it’s a recent piece or not. 3. Add images (or video) Writing is tough. At the end of the writing process, you just want to get your post up and be done with it. But users only read on average 20 percent of the text on any given web page, so you have to give them something else to entice them and focus them. You need to be able to tell at least part of your story through images. One of the best examples of this is Neil Patel’s blog. He consistently includes 20+ images in his rather epic blog posts: Source: Neil Patel Adding a featured header image to your blog post is table stakes at this point; it’s the bare minimum. If you want your readers to stick around and be informed, then you need to complement your content with multiple images, screen shots, tables, charts and/or videos. 4. Add internal and external links Links are the currency of the internet. When I coach my clients, I always encourage them to include both internal and external links in their content pieces. If you don’t offer your readers anywhere to go for more information, then it’s not a genuinely helpful article. Linking to other pages or posts on your website is a good way to help Google understand your website, and it can improve your bounce rate and time on site. And remember that when you link to external websites, it’s best practice to open those links in a new window. 5. Add a call-to-action button This happens — All. The. Time. If someone has made it halfway through your article — or even all the way to the bottom — you’ve done a good job as a content producer. Now it’s time to offer them a next step. What do you want them to do? Read another, related blog post or e-book Visit a product page Sign up for your e-newsletter Fill out a lead form Purchase a product or service Pick only one action you want the reader to take, and promote it. Make the button clear and the offer compelling by focusing on the benefits to the user. You can do better than “Learn more” or “Buy now.” The vast majority of blog posts miss this opportunity, and — irony intended — abruptly end.

Trump’s Immigration Policy Threatens Asians Working in Silicon Valley Asians in Silicon Valley, whether CEOs or undocumented workers, will be impacted by the new policies. In Silicon Valley, where 60 percent of foreign-born individuals hail from India, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and other Asian countries, the outcry against President Trump's anti-immigration stance has been especially high-profile. And the latest immigration rules, rolled out in the last few days, have many communities on edge. On Friday, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency announced that it would suspend the H-1B visa program, one of the main routes to employment for immigrants sponsored by tech companies. Then Trump signed a new executive order on Monday banning entry from six countries: Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. These new rules will weaken the Asian community in the US, and its powerful contribution to the technology industry in the US. Throughout 2015, Asians made up 27 percent of the workforce at Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, LinkedIn, and Yahoo (though they were underrepresented in managerial and executive-level positions). In recent years, they've also made gains in the C suite with Google's Indian-born CEO, Sundar Pichai, and Microsoft's Indian-born CEO, Satya Nadella. Microsoft, Google and Amazon were in the top 20 companies that sponsor immigrant workers through H-1B visas, according to My Visa Jobs. But less visibly, thousands of low-paid foreign workers on H-1B visa programs also work to keep Silicon Valley running. Many work as janitors, security guards, maintenance employees, or cooks to support their families. And often for a less-than-livable wage. When the first wave of travel ban and immigration rules was announced under the Trump administration, more than 100 tech companies, included Apple and Facebook, joined together to sign an amicus brief opposing the executive order. These companies are likely to speak out again since the latest rules are just slightly scaled-back versions of those announced earlier, though several of them also seek to benefit from the Trump administration. "The Order makes it more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world's best employees," it read. "It disrupts ongoing business operations. And it threatens companies' ability to attract talent, business, and investment to the United States." Meanwhile, the administration's crackdown on undocumented workers will also upend the communities in and around Silicon Valley. There are an estimated 1.6 million undocumented Asian immigrants in the valley—a number that may be surprising to some—according to AAPI Data. They account for roughly 14 percent of the entire undocumented population, and have remained largely invisible compared to other minority diaspora. "Undocumented immigration is clearly not just a Latinx issue, but also a deep AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islanders] one too," Gregory Cendana, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance (APALA), told Motherboard. Trump's newest immigration rules, which seek to deport anyone in violation of immigration laws, not just those with criminal records, will impact almost all immigrant communities. The measures detailed in two Department of Homeland Security memos introduced in February outline a policy that looks similar to President Obama's, but with greater and more severe law enforcement mandates. Together, first and second-generation Asian Americans (in many cases, children and their immigrant parents) amounted to 37 percent of their racial demographic in 2012, a Pew Research Center census found. The combination of stripped-down visa programs and law enforcement will undoubtedly alter the communities that comprise Silicon Valley, and weaken some economic sectors supported by Asian immigrants.  But maybe that's what Steve Bannon wants.

Boasian Anthropology is a widely respected branch of anthropology and not in any way a “pseudo-scientific Jewish assault” on anything. The article that was popping up at the top of Google search results was from a website called Smash Cultural Marxism, which is known for espousing anti-communist and white nationalist views, in case the phrases about race being “rooted in biology or scientific determinism” rather than social constructs didn’t make the latter clear. As The Verge noted in an article on the issue, anthropologist Michael Oman-Reagan tweeted that the Smash Cultural Marxism article was still appearing at the top of Google search results eight hours after Weibel-Swanson posted about it. The “bug” was eventually addressed or worked itself out. “Google does not endorse or select responses manually,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge. “This content comes from the third-party sites that we do not control. The feature is an automatic and algorithmic match to the search query. We welcome feedback, as we’re always working to improve our algorithms. Users and content owners can give feedback on incorrect information through the ‘Feedback’ button at the bottom right of the WebAnswer.” This week’s mix up was the second time in recent months that white nationalists seem to have somehow manipulated Google’s algorithm to get articles bumped to the top of search results. In December, users complained that searches for “Did the Holocaust happen?” were returning an article from a neo-Nazi website as the top result. The article, titled “Top 10 reasons why the holocaust didn’t happen,” was from the website Stormfront. The first line of the featured snippet that appeared with the article at the top of the search results read, “The Holocaust Lie more than anything else keeps us down.” Frank Boas is a late 19th and 20th century Jewish anthropologist who founded the relativistic, culture-centered… https://t.co/QOfLbJu0qD — Leo Baeck Institute (@lbinyc) February 28, 2017 Gizmodo reported at the time that Google initially refused to take any action to have the article removed from the top of search results. A Google spokesperson said that while the company was “saddened to see that hate organizations still exist,” it does “not remove content from [its] search results, except in very limited cases such as illegal content, malware and violations of our webmaster guidelines.” The spokesperson also made clear that “the fact that hate sites appear in Search results does not mean that Google endorses these views.” Previous issues with racist and anti-Semitic results populating the top of Google searches date back to 2008 at least, when a search for “Jew” would often return a hit for the website Jew Watch near the top of the results, according to Gizmodo. When Google cofounder Sergey Brin was asked about adjusting the algorithm to prevent such results from reaching the top levels of search results, he said that would be “bad technology practice,” the Gizmodo article continues. “An important part of our values as a company is that we don’t edit the search results,” Brin said. “What our algorithms produce, whether we like it or not, are the search results. I think people want to know we have unbiased search results.” It is not clear if Google altered the search results for Boasian Anthropology, or if the issue corrected itself through changing search patterns.

How to use Google Tag Manager to show your clients results Columnist Sherry Bonelli provides an overview of Google Tag Manager, including how get started with it. Sherry Bonelli on March 6, 2017 at 12:39 pm More Are you tired of asking your web developer to add code, snippets, pixels or scripts to your site so you can track remarketing, conversions, analytics and more? Google Tag Manager (GTM) allows you to add or update tags without having to bother your developer. Google Tag Manager gives you control over how your tags are defined and how they fire. GTM involves a little bit of a learning curve, but once you understand the basics, you’ll wonder how you ever got along without it. If you’re an SEO who hasn’t yet delved into tracking codes (I know you’re out there, and it’s okay!), now’s the time to start. Using tracking code will help you measure the results of your marketing campaigns — essentially, you’ll be able to show the results that your digital marketing efforts are making. And don’t worry, you don’t have to be a programmer to dig in. As an added bonus, you can use GTM to manage your clients’ campaigns as well — all without having to log into the back end of their websites. Google Tag Manager is a large topic, so in this post we’re just going to cover the basics. What is a tag? A tag is a snippet of code that tracks and sends information about activities on your site to third parties (such as Google). You might use tags to track conversions or visits to a particular web page. In the past, if you wanted to add tags to your site, you’d have to manually add these snippets to the source code of your web pages. This often required going through a developer, which could delay implementation for days or even weeks. And of course, if you needed to make adjustments or updates to the tags, you (or a developer) would need to do so within the page source code. With Google Tag Manager, you add a single container code snippet to each page of your site. This container snippet handles the deployment and execution of all your tags across the site. You simply add, update and manage the tags you want to use within the Google Tag Manager interface. Getting started with Google Tag Manager To start using GTM, visit the Google Tag Manager login page. If you already have a Google Analytics account, it’ll be super-easy to set up — you simply need to log in with your Google account, and you’ll be ready to set up your tags. The first thing to do is give your account a name. You’ll want to name your account with the name of your company so that you can find and manage each of the sites you have in GTM. It’s generally recommended that you have one account per company and one container per site. Once you have your account set up, you will create your first container. Give your container a name and indicate where you want to use the container: website, iOS, Android or AMP. Click Create once you’ve chosen your container location, and agree to the Terms of Service. Next you will be given two pieces of script to put on your site: The Google Tag Manager snippet must be placed on every page of your website. Google cautions you not to put code in a hidden iframe and not to use another tag management system while using GTM (It can cause issues). Once you’ve added your GTM snippet code to your site, Google Tag Manager is ready to go. As your containers grow over time, it can get difficult to track all your tags, triggers and variables. GTM allows you to create folders to help you organize. With folders, you can organize your tags in groupings so it’ll be easier to update and manage as needed. Setting up triggers & variables Tags typically execute, or “fire,” when a web page loads or when some other user interaction occurs. In Google Tag Manager, you define triggers with tags to tell GTM when a tag should fire. A great example of a trigger is the “Page View” trigger, which can be used if you want to have your tag fire when a specific page loads. You will want to tell GTM what to do when a certain action is taken by a user. Setting up triggers is easy to do — you just choose the trigger type: Variables help define triggers and what data they send. For instance, you could set up a variable when someone goes to a specific page or clicks on a checkout button or download page. More in-depth GTM features Google Tag Manager has a lot more advanced features and details, like layers and setting up administrators/users. You can find information on all Google Tag Manager features on Google Tag Manager’s help section. Remember to publish Changes you make to GTM don’t work until you publish. Once you’ve added or edited tags, triggers and variables in a workspace, you’ll need to publish: With a little learning and practice, you’ll find that managing the tracking code you use will be much easier and more efficient thanks to Google Tag Manager.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Warren Report So Much for Trump Being “Presidential” Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Warren Report So Much for Trump Being “Presidential” Trump’s disastrous, conspiracy-filled, tweet-obsessed weekend. (A version of this column originally appeared on Poynter.org.) by James Warren, Chief Media Writer, Poynter.orgMarch 6, 2017 12:00 pm Email Facebook Twitter Trump's been listening to Breitbart conspiracies. By Mark Wilson/Getty Images. President Trump’s speech to Congress prompted the press to act like a parent rewarding a toddler for not throwing up at the dinner table. It set the bar rather low, as he reminded the world over the weekend. It was just last Tuesday night that Van Jones of CNN cited one part of the speech and announced how Trump “became president of the United States in that moment, period.” Until a few days later, when Trump badmouthed President Obama and offered no evidence for a charge that he was wiretapped during the campaign. (@realDonaldTrump) It appeared he was responding to implications in a Breitbart News story, which then prompted Breitbart to assert that we should all blame The New York Times. (Breitbart) Yes, defending itself by saying it had merely aped that paragon of the evil mainstream media, The New York Times. Like Trump, it appears to crave validation by the same media it reflexively derides. But put aside the wiretap-related tweets. My own personal favorite came at 7:10 a.m. Eastern Saturday from Mar-a-Lago, presumably during a commercial break in the weekend edition of “Fox & Friends.” “Arnold Schwarzenegger isn’t voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me,” tweeted the newly “presidential” Donald Trump. “Sad end to great show.” (@realDonaldTrump) So how does one square the Trump praised by pundits last week with the Maligner of Mar-a-Lago? Says Joe Conason, editor of the National Memo, “Like most Americans, our colleagues wish that America had a ‘normal’ president. But he has reminded us more than once that he can mimic presidential demeanor. This is a dangerous illusion that we shouldn’t foist on the public.” And, as put by Keith Olbermann to me Sunday: “From Chris Wallace to Van Jones, they provided insight that would last a lunchtime.” An amazing saga continues The New York Times disclosed, rather amazingly, “The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, asked the Justice Department this weekend to publicly reject President Trump’s assertion that President Barack Obama ordered the tapping of Mr. Trump’s phones, senior American officials said on Sunday.” CNN and The Washington Post were those who both quickly sought to cover the story and credited The Times. But one obvious question not quickly broached was this: What in the world is the difference between the FBI chief asking the Attorney General to call Trump claim B.S. and the FBI chief essentially going public and calling it B.S.? An obvious long profile: “James Comey: Sober law enforcer gone haywire.” He screwed up the Hillary Clinton emails matter and now is way out front on this wiretap tale without quietly laboring to be part of a coherent Department of Justice position. As a Justice Department alum friend of mine says, Comey seems totally, completely self-absorbed. Our wayward warriors “The U.S. Department of Defense is investigating hundreds of Marines who used social media to solicit and share hundreds — possibly thousands — of naked photographs of women service members and veterans,” writes Thomas James Brennan, a former Marine sergeant-turned-journalist and a Purple Heart winner for the Center for Investigative Reporting. (Reveal) As The Charlotte News & Observer reported, and his agent Stuart Krichevsky underscored, Brennan and family have received death threats. Through his agent comes this statement from Brennan: “The story I reported is obviously a highly sensitive one, and it’s no surprise that there have been some negative responses and threats made. However, the focus here should not be on me or the threats to my family, but on making sure the stories of the victims of these behaviors come to light.” Google and “fake news” “During the initial dustup over ‘fake news,’ Google and its parent company Alphabet got less flack for spreading hoaxes than social media platforms like Facebook and Reddit. This week, the search giant is taking its lumps.” (Recode) “First: BuzzFeed explained how Alphabet-owned YouTube became the ‘engine’ of false conspiracy theories like Pizzagate. Strike one.” “Second: SearchEngineLand editor Danny Sullivan noticed that Google was passing off right-wing paranoia as the promoted answer to questions like, ‘Is Obama planning a coup?’ and, ‘Is Obama planning martial law?’ Strike two.” As Snap ascended, they faltered TechCrunch’s Joanna Glasner looks at all the once “hot” messaging apps that started going south, despite the initial adoration of tech investors, as Snap headed north. (TechCrunch) “Last year, the biggest tech IPO was Line, an unprofitable messaging app known for its cute animated stickers. Before Line, there was WhatsApp, which had just 55 employees in 2014 when it sold to Facebook for $19 billion. Twitter, not really a messaging tool but sharing many of the features, peaked a few years ago around a $40 billion valuation. Tencent-owned WeChat, China’s hottest messaging and productivity app, has an internal valuation some analysts have pegged around $80 billion.” The FISA court Thanks to The Washington Post’s Ellen Nakashima for a quick and solid backgrounder on the very secretive FISA court amid Trump’s tweet-inspired journalists’ own tweetstorm Saturday. The ignorance and conspiracy theories were rampant for much the day. Having a friend who served on the court, I cringed. (The Washington Post) Send in the clowns At the elite Gridiron Dinner in Washington Saturday, Mike Pence tried his hand at humor. On analysis of Trump’s speech to Congress: “I even thought I heard Rachel Maddow start to say something nice, but then MSNBC immediately cut to commercial.” When it came to his own email mess: “The end of the week was a little embarrassing for me. Not that I had a personal email account when I was governor. [It] really was embarrassing for me to have millions of Americans learn that I’m one of the few people in the country to still have an AOL account.” Guys, get some writers. Maybe fellow Hoosier David Letterman can assist. Cuts at Commerce “White House proposes steep budget cut to leading climate science agency,” declared The Washington Post. It focused on plans “to slash” the budget of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The New York Times referenced the Post story the next day in a piece on EPA cuts. Lost amid the implicit theme of odious Trump cuts was whether or not one might actually be able to find such cuts in a government agency without the end of the world beckoning. It’s the sort of question the vast majority of beat reporters, even at A-list places like The New York Times and The Washington Post, are incapable of answering. They may know a fair bit about overall policies and politics of an agency but zilch about personnel quality, productivity and efficiency of those agencies with their multitude of separate departments, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I asked a former top Commerce official (a Democrat), who knows the 47,000-employee department cold, about whether that agency in particular could tolerate such cuts. The response? “Yes.” Pravda’s Sunday highlights The White House now offers its own press release on the “highlights” of the Sunday shows. It opened yesterday’s with, “Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on ABC’s This Week: ‘If this happened, if this is accurate, this is the biggest overreach and the biggest scandal.’” Huckabee’s fumbling performance with sub-host Martha Raddatz was rightly skewered this morning by CNN’s Brian Stelter and Bill Carter, who noted Trump’s “smear” against Obama and reliance on dubious conspiratorial sources. Creative relief Need a respite from journalists blogging (at times, it seems, for other journalists) about Trump, be it press conferences or speeches? Trying journalists blogging about art, in particular New York’s big Armory Week art fair. (ARTnews) Want to know how a big installation by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, 87, began as a mere sketch on a napkin that she faxed over? That and much more can be found. The graying of our billionaires In a follow-up to its expanded Billionaire’s Index, Bloomberg reports on how so many of American billionaires are just very old. “The problem is most acute in the U.S. and Europe, where about a quarter of the billionaires on the index are age 80 or older, compared to 20 percent in Asia.” There there’s this: “In mainland China, where only chemical maker Xu Chuanhua has reached that milestone, just 3 percent of the wealth is in the hands of the elderly, with about 40 percent held by billionaires under age 50.” A reporter’s latest ignominy Juan Thompson was described by one and all as a former disgraced reporter for The Intercept when word got out about his being charged “with making more than a half-dozen bomb threats against Jewish community centers, schools and a Jewish history museum, federal authorities said.” (The New York Times) He had other stops. Michael Miner of the alternative Chicago Reader, wrote a year ago, “Has anyone ever been disowned faster than Juan Thompson?” Miner goes on. “He’d just been accused by the website the Intercept of fabricating quotes, creating fake email accounts, and impersonating other people, including the editor of the website. The site had described Thompson as a former reporter for DNAinfo Chicago and for WBEZ, but both media were quick to minimize their connections.” “‘He interned for us a few summers ago — VERY briefly,’ tweeted DNAinfo’s Jen Sabella. WBEZ’s Ben Calhoun, the head of programming, said Thompson had been an intern for a talk show for four months and ‘the extent of his duties was minimal.’” Miner noted how The Riverfront Times in St. Louis ran an opus on Thompson that argued “Thompson might have done more damage than more celebrated media fabricators such as Stephen Glass and Jayson Blair because in Thompson’s time reporting is so much more rapidly (and carelessly) repurposed.” (Riverfront Times) Saturday night at Mar-a-lago The Palm Beach Post reports, “Some 300 guests mingled with donors and doctors at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, sipping champagne and admiring the cherry blossoms and hydrangeas that decorated the tables in the grand ballroom, the one where President Donald Trump and wife, Melania, had celebrated their 2005 wedding.” “But in other parts of the Trump-owned property, the mood was decidedly more serious. Guests caught glimpses of Trump meeting with members of his team, including Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and Gen. John Kelly, head of the Department of Homeland Security.” There was Attorney General Jeff Sessions, too, but if he “was taken to the gilded woodshed at Mar-a-Lago, he showed no signs of it during a brief encounter with Bascom Palmer guests. In Mar-a-Lago’s grand salon, where tapestries hang heavy on the walls, Sessions was all smiles as he greeted the gala’s attendees.” In search of online sizzle Headline on print version of Amanda Hess story in New York Times Magazine on internet trolling: “Clickbait.” Headline on mobile version: “How the Trolls Stole Washington” The morning babble Fox & Friends opened with, what else, possible surveillance of Trump’s New York office. It chided a key New York Times story for having unnamed sources (while MSNBC actually had one of the reporters). Co-host Brian Kilmeade said, with scant argument, that “in retrospect, it (Trump’s) was a tweet that caused a lot of consternation,” while badmouthing the integrity of James Clapper for a notoriously wrong 2013 statement during congressional statement about whether the NSA collected (so-called phone metadata) on millions of Americans. CNN’s New Day noted that Hillary Clinton felt the FBI (Comey) was out to get her, now Trump thinks the intelligence community is undermining him. Citing the latest wiretap story, co-host Chris Cuomo said, “My main question every day is why?” He opted for the term “V.D.,” for “virtual deception” — before switching to the North Korean missile program, and the Obama-era cyber war against it so vividly (and scarily) detailed over the weekend by The New York Times. Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC’s Morning Joe found nothing especially “virtual” in our midst. We are viewing “no respect for the office (of president) and (Trump) calling the former president unbelievable names. We are at a low point in American history, and I don’t know how anybody can defend this president even if it’s their job.” Any doubt about her take on things? Here’s her speaking, and emoting, to Trump-ites: “And when you are out speaking for President Trump, I would urge you not laugh at yourself because this is not funny. This is really bad. just for the record, we’re all really nervous. So if people out there feel really nervous, we do, too.” Corrections? Tips? Please email me: jwarren@poynter.org.

The Komodo dragon has become one of Indonesia's rare conservation success stories. Trisnadi/AP/File | Caption Loading... Jason Thomson Staff | @jason_a_thomson March 6, 2017 —Today, Google honors the Komodo dragon in its latest Google Doodle – the shifting shape of its logo that celebrates all manner of things, from holidays and anniversaries to artists, pioneers, and scientists. And legendary animals. The Komodo dragon is the world’s largest living lizard – stretching to some eight feet in length – and survives only on a handful of Indonesian islands. Yet, while many large animals both in Indonesia and other parts of the world are suffering a slide toward extinction, the Komodo dragon’s story reads differently: Conservation efforts to preserve this giant lizard are proving remarkably successful. Can the Komodo dragon's success provide a blueprint for other big beasts, a roadmap to survival? As Achmad Ariefiandy, an Indonesian expert on Komodos with the Komodo Dragon Survivor Program, explained to environment and wildlife publication Mongabay, one of the keys to this creature’s survival has been the establishment of Komodo National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site. In fact, Google is celebrating the 37th anniversary of this park's creation. Within the preserve, which holds most of the wild Komodo dragon population, conservation biologists have focused on protecting not only the dragons themselves but also their habitat and their prey, as well as educating and working with local communities. And while the islands draw tourists from all over the globe, the adverse effects of that intrusion are limited because a mere 10 percent of the national park is open to visitors. 14 animals declared extinct in the 21st century While this multi-faceted approach certainly holds lessons for other conservation efforts, there are also some unique characteristics about both the Komodo dragons and their circumstances. For one, their sharply limited geography actually helps efforts to preserve them. Such distinct borders to their territory create a natural barrier to various forms of encroachment and a clear definition to the areas being preserved. Of course, living on only a few islands also brings challenges, not least the inhibition of substantial population growth. But these lizards are also resilient, able to withstand harsh environmental conditions. They can smell carrion from as far away as 2.5 miles, and will spend hours in a single spot, waiting for prey to wander by. Scientists believe that the Komodo dragon used to inhabit a range far larger than its present-day confinement. In fact, the discovery of fossils from between 300,000 and 4 million years ago in Australia indicate they may have originated in the land down under. And when the Komodos lived in Australia, they did not hold the title of “largest lizard.” They were outdone by the 16-foot-long Megalania, extinct for the past 40,000 years. Just why the Komodo dragon has survived, and other giant lizards did not, is an open question. But most experts agree that the precipitous decline in numbers of the Komodo, to today’s total wild population of somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000, is the fault of humans. Researchers are keen to dig deeper into these historical trends, hoping they could provide insights into future prospects.

Among its most popular content: lots of Facebook apps and a movie that caused an international incident. Internet by Richard Nieva March 6, 2017 9:00 AM PST @richardjnieva Adele's album "25" is the top-selling album in Google Play's five-year history. Paul Kane, Getty Images It's time for a trip down memory lane. On Monday, Google Play, the search giant's online store for apps, movies, music and books, turns five years old. To commemorate the anniversary, Google is releasing lists of the store's most popular content of all time in the US. Some of the top titles aren't surprises. Candy Crush Saga, the addictive game by the mobile company King, was the top game. Adele, perennial internet darling, had the top-selling album, "25." (Adele, by the way, also accounted for last year's top viral video on Google-owned YouTube, with her turn on "Carpool Karaoke" on "The Late Late Show with James Corden.") Editors' note: Corden's show airs on CBS, CNET's parent company. Three of the top five apps come from Facebook: the main Facebook app, the Facebook Messenger chat app and Instagram. Snapchat, the disappearing photo app whose parent company, Snap, went public last week, rounds out the top five. (The ranking doesn't include preinstalled apps, like Gmail or Google Maps, on Android devices.) App stores have been a driving force behind the popularity of smartphones, which for many people are much more about apps than about basic phone capabilities like calling. All that got rolling with Apple's App Store, which launched in 2008, offered 2.2 million apps last year and recorded its best sales day ever on New Year's Day of this year. The Play store has "millions" of apps (though a Google spokeswoman declined to share a more specific number), 40 million songs and 5 million books. The best-of lists aren't just a measuring stick for each of the apps or artists. The lists are also a good window into pop culture -- and sometimes a wormhole into major events -- in the United States over the past five years. For example, the No. 1 movie was "The Interview," the Seth Rogen and James Franco film about assassinating North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. If you remember, that was the movie embroiled in the Sony Entertainment hacks in 2014. At the time, the FBI said the hackers had ties to North Korea, and there was fear of terrorist attacks if the movie was released in theaters. So, the studio released the movie on services like Google Play and iTunes on Christmas Eve that year. Below are the full lists: Top installed games Candy Crush Saga Subway Surfers Temple Run 2 Despicable Me Clash of Clans Top installed apps (doesn't include preinstalled apps on Android devices) Facebook Facebook Messenger Pandora Radio Instagram Snapchat Top-selling songs Ed Sheeran - "Thinking Out Loud" Lorde - "Royals" Taylor Swift - "Blank Space" Mark Ronson feat. Bruno Mars - "Uptown Funk" Pharrell Williams - "Happy" Top-selling albums Adele - "25" Eminem - "The Marshall Mathers LP2 (Deluxe)" Taylor Swift - "1989" Drake - "If You're Reading This It's Too Late" Kendrick Lamar - "To Pimp A Butterfly" Top-selling movies "The Interview" "Frozen" "Deadpool" "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" "Guardians of the Galaxy" Top-selling books "Fifty Shades of Grey," by E L James "The Hunger Games trilogy," by Suzanne Collins "A Game of Thrones," by George RR Martin "The Fault in Our Stars," by John Green "Gone Girl," by Gillian Flynn CNET Magazine: Check out a sampling of the stories you'll find in CNET's newsstand edition.

Google is planning to release a second-generation Pixel smartphone later this year following the success of the first generation phone. Speaking at a roundtable discussion during Mobile World Congress last week, Google senior vice president of hardware Rick Osterloh told Android Pit that the company intended to follow the “annual rhythm” of the smartphone industry. “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me,” Osterloh told the publication, adding that the phone’s pricing would stay in the premium segment. Osterloh did not provide details on when the phone may be released or about specifications on the feature set of the Pixel 2. He said there are too few current-generation Pixel devices to meet consumer demand. Last month, Google released a statement saying that it will not stop Pixel devices manufacturing in response to rumors that the company would cease production of its Pixel lineup.

The Pixel, with the built-in personal Google Assistant, has the highest rated smartphone camera. It combines hardware and software made by Google, including all the users’ favorite Google apps.

(encrier / Istock.com) Relaxnews Published Monday, March 6, 2017 11:47AM EST In a strategy seen as an offensive move against Google Trips, Facebook has launched city guides of its own, and gone one step further by adding the option of booking a hotel restaurant or tour. The feature was launched within a Facebook update with little fanfare, notes industry travel watcher Skift, and enables users to book their hotel room or make reservations in select cities directly through the app via a Book Now button. "Facebook's latest move into the travel ecosystem could be seen as a big challenge to Google," wrote Skift analyst Dennis Schaal in the piece. Because while Google Trips was also created as a mobile trip planner, complete with travel itinerary, city guide and tips on how to get around, the app stops short of allowing users to book reservations. Facebook's booking feature is "an important step by a company with a mammoth user base," Schaal adds. The app likewise takes a page out of the geolocating app Foursquare, showing users lists of cities their friends have visited, along with recommendations on the places to go and things to do thanks to Facebook's existing check-in feature, noted TechCrunch. A section called "Places the Locals Go," is also made up of the most popular, highly-rated spots within Facebook. Last year, Icelandair launched a new service allowing passengers to book their flight through Facebook Messenger, while KLM passengers became the first carrier to partner with Facebook in a new feature that allows fliers to check-in, get their boarding pass and receive flight status updates directly through Facebook Messenger.

The company has been marketing it a lot in the country, hoping to get as many users on board as possible. It partnered up with All India Bakchod, a popular stand-up comedy group with over two million YouTube subscribers, to make a comedy sketch that advertised a few of Allo’s features. It also advertised its app in a popular coffee chain called Cafe Coffee Day. Unfortunately, it looks like Google’s efforts hasn’t been producing the results that were expected. According to an app analytics firm Sensor Tower, Allo has been downloaded just 3.1 million times on Android and 264,000 times on iOS devices in India since its launch — September 2016.

In the same time frame, Facebook Messenger was downloaded 33 million times on Android and 1.7 million times on iOS devices, while WhatsApp was downloaded 58.6 million times from the Google Play Store and 3.2 million times from the App Store. The data shows that Google Allo isn’t very popular among Indian users, at least not yet. As of now, WhatsApp is number one on the list of the most popular messaging apps in the country with over 200 million active users. Nevertheless, we still expect that Google will keep trying to increase Allo’s market share in India as well as in other countries around the world. The company has already announced that it plans on bringing Allo to desktops, although we still don’t know when exactly will that happen.

The problem lies in its ‘featured snippets’ functionality, which allows users to ask a question without leaving the search box and provides a short answer by taking information from across the web.   For instance a user may ask “how many countries are in the world?”. Google’s search engine will provide a quick answer of 196 countries, citing website infoplease.com without the user having to click on a further link. A version of the feature is also provided through the Google’s smart speaker device, Google Home. However, the feature has been criticised of pulling inaccurate information from the internet and failing to recognise it as fake news. Over the weekend, Google’s featured snippets was asked if Obama was planning a coup to which it pulled up a response from a website called Secrets of the Fed.  “According to details exposed in Western Centre for Journalism’s exclusive video, not only could Obama be in bed with the communist Chinese, but Obama may in fact be planning a communist coup d’état at the end of his term in 2016!” Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has since removed the search snippet but The Outline’s Adrianne Jeffries nas revealed a number of other inaccurate results including search snippets claiming that monosodium glutamate causes brain damage, Obama is the King of the US, and former US President Warren Harding was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Responding to the criticism, Google said: “Featured snippets in search provide an automatic and algorithmic match to a given search query, and the content comes from third-party sites. Unfortunately, there are instances when we feature a site with inappropriate or misleading content. When we are alerted to a featured snippet that violates our policies, we work quickly to remove them, which we have done in this instance.

But what about hotels with limited funds? What about hostels, bed and breakfasts, inns and other small properties? NB This is a viewpoint by Brandon Dennis, VP of marketing at Cloudbeds. It is harder for small properties to get SEO right, but the good news is that it’s possible. Here’s how you start: Set the right expectations SEO is a long-term strategy. There are no quick wins. There are no shortcuts. You might not see success for months, or even years. You need to be ok with that. Think about SEO like investing in the stock market. Sure, a few people get quick wins, but for most investors, they only find success after years of investment in mutual or index funds. You will only find success with SEO if you understand that you are in it for the long-haul. Become “the SEO guy (or girl)” The big hotel chains have SEO teams. Even large independent properties have a marketing and SEO person. You need one too. Now, maybe you already have a web development person on staff. Or maybe you have someone who produces content, and does social media. Great! This person needs to take on SEO duties. If you don’t have an employee who does this, then you need to do it yourself. I realize that you’re already busy with running your property. I realize that you are already stretched for time. But you must market your business online to ensure its success. If you don’t have someone on staff who can do this for you, and if you don’t have the resources to hire one, then you need to it – pure and simple. A great way to free up time to work on your property’s SEO is to simplify the other aspects of your business. Too many properties are still using spreadsheets to manage their daily activities. Invest in an affordable property management system to free up your time, and then use that time to forge an SEO strategy. Optimize your website There are countless guides on how to optimize your website for SEO. The truth is that the success or failure of your SEO doesn’t depend on technical website optimization. It rests more on the content you produce than on the technical “i’s and “ts that you dot and cross. You can optimize almost any website platform for search engines. This includes WordPress, the world’s most popular content management system. Once you choose your platform, look up guides on how to optimize that system for SEO. Spend some time tinkering, but not too much–your primary concern is content. And if you have a managed web hosting provider then be sure to reach out to them to fix SEO issues. You’re already paying for their help, after all. Content Content is the most important part of your SEO strategy. If you have no content on your website, then Google has nothing to index, and nothing to rank. The more quality content you produce, the more visitors you will get from search engines. The more visitors you get, the more guests you get. Thus content, and the velocity at which you produce it, impacts how much business you get from your SEO strategy. Focus You’re not the big guys. You can’t have content on every single topic that might relate to your property. So instead, specialize. If you can’t be an expert on everything, then become an expert on one thing. What is the one thing about your area that you can become an expert on? What can you write about that people will find interesting, and that will draw people to your business? Find this focus. Make it part of your brand. Write about it. Post about it on social media. Make it part of your identity. Become a topical authority on this focused idea, so that guests go to you instead of OTAs and large chains. Keyword Research This focus ties in with keyword research. There are many ways to research the kinds of words your guests use to find properties like yours when booking travel. One tool is Google’s free Keyword Planner tool. You can discover the words that have sent people to your website, and to the websites of your competitors. You can understand how competitive they are. Using tools like Moz’s Keyword Difficulty Tool (paid), you can discover good keyword opportunities. Understanding these things is essential to produce the right kind of content. I once was doing keyword research for a customer. I discovered that my client was getting a lot of traffic about something called a “grunion run”. What on earth is a grunion? Some sort of…greasy onion? I did some Googling, and discovered that a grunion is a special kind of fish. Once a year, millions of grunions crawl out of the sea to lay their eggs in the sand. This event is a popular tourist attraction. Wouldn’t you know it, my client’s hotel was smack-dab on the very beach where the grunions came out of the sea each year. Now, my client had no content about grunions on his website. So I created a content strategy around grunions. My client changed his property’s brand to focus on the annual grunion run. He became a topical authority on it. He produced maps on where to find the best grunions, lists of tools to use, recipes for cooking grunions, and so on. This one, niche topic became part of his hotel’s brand, and it improved his business. Keyword research will help you discover things that you can use to brand yourself. It will help you uncover topics about which you can become an authority. This will make your property a homing beacon for people interested in your topic. Share your content Once you start producing content, you have to promote it. You can’t rely on friends and family alone. You can’t post it to Facebook and hope that it will “go viral”. No, your only shot at success is if you get your hands dirty and promote your content. Let’s say you made an infographic about the best spots on a specific beach to catch grunions. Sure, post it to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram, but then go even further. Find a dozen popular blogs about fishing. Email the owners and journalists and share your infographic with them. Find local businesses. Contact them and ask if they will publish your infographic on their websites. Email your local newspaper and share it with them. Find online fishing communities and share it there. You get the idea? Content won’t share itself, so you have to. Consider online ads I’ve discovered a funny thing. Every time I spend money on ads, I tend to get a burst of organic traffic from search engines that sticks. I can’t explain it. Google has said that it  does not improve a website’s ranking just because the website purchases ads. Nevertheless, I have noticed that properties who spend money on online ads tend to get more organic traffic too. It works using Google Adwords, or even social media ad platforms such as Facebook Ads. Take a look at your marketing budget. Even if you did not intend to start advertising, it may be worthwhile to create a few campaigns with limited budget, to see how it goes. Spend, say, $100 a week or even less. It doesn’t have to be a lot. But try it, and then compare your organic traffic before you started advertising to after. If it has improved, you may want to expand your online advertising. The Billboard Effect Everyone is familiar with the Billboard Effect by now. It describes the phenomena by which your website’s direct reservations improve by as much as 25% when you start listing inventory on online travel agencies (OTAs). It works like this: Your guest goes to Expedia to shop for travel. While there, they discover your property, but they want to learn more. They open up a new browser tab and Google your property name. Your website pops up, and while on your site, they see a deal that they just can’t miss. So, instead of booking with Expedia, they book with you. This is the Billboard Effect. Now, this can help your SEO too. Google tends to reward websites in the rankings that display “positive brand metrics”. That’s a fancy way of saying that people know about you and use Google to search for you. The more branded searches your property gets on Google, the healthier your SEO will become. Leveraging the Billboard Effect is a great way to get more branded Google searches. It’s good to list at least a few rooms on a healthy variety of OTAs. You may be concerned about overbookings. If so, use a channel manager to make sure that your online listings are always kept up-to-date. Online business profiles Claim as many online business profiles as you can, and keep them up to date. Use a channel manager to create listings on popular and niche OTAs. Then, use a tool such as Moz Local (paid) to discover online business directories. Create listings for your property on them. The thinking behind this goes like so: Google likes seeing positive brand metrics. It likes seeing lots of listings about your property, and it likes seeing listings that all agree about you. You have a dozen listings. But if the hotel name is misspelled in half of them, or has the wrong address, Google gets confused. It doesn’t know what to think about your hotel. But if all your property’s online profiles are complete, then this gives Google confidence in the quality of information they have about you. This makes them more likely to promote you on Google. Ensure your listings have correct spelling, updated contact info, and helpful descriptions. Claim and update your business listing on Google Business Places, Bing for Business, Yelp, YP.com, TripAdvisor, and more. Conclusion Yeah, this is a lot of work. No doubt about it. But no one expects you to finish it all in a day. Instead, create a strategy. Break it into phases, and give each phase a due date. Work on it slowly over time. One day you will wake up and realize that you have a killer website, with great content, and a vocal fanbase on social media. You’ll see your organic slice of the pie get bigger and bigger in Google Analytics. One day you’ll realize that most of your direct reservations are coming from search engines, and you’re not paying for them. It’s a long journey, but one worth taking.

In particular the section on the Billboard effect, that showing conflicting evidence, based on who is sponsoring, from time to time, the market research. However the fact is that, at least, in local SEO, a good optimization on site and with good contents you can begin to make a good SEO for hotels. Reply 17 hrs ago   Consulente seo Great list. Just a question. For a small B&B you will consider to use a simply html website instead a cms? Usually a B&B has few pages and write few news so, cold be done manually on html. Do you think it’s could be an advantage? Reply 10 months ago   Stuart smart Reply 1 year ago   Brandon Dennis Very kind 🙂 Reply 1 year ago   Alessia Martalò Great post!

She had found the infant playing with an open bottle of aspirin. "They told him to go home and take a nap. So they went somewhere else where they pumped his stomach and sent him home," Wojcicki says today. "She then went to another hospital and they sent my mother and my grandmother home, but kept him in. The next morning when my grandmother called, they said to her, 'Your son is in the morgue. You can pick him up.' "My mum doesn't trust the system and she hammered it into me that you can't just trust that somebody is going to do the right thing for you. If you want to have the best health outcome, you need to be in charge of your health." ADVERTISEMENT Wojcicki's personalised-genetics company 23andMe aims to do just that. By offering customers individual genomic information – spit in a test tube, post it to a laboratory and, a couple of weeks later, you'll receive a report detailing health conditions towards which you may have a genetic predisposition – it aims to give people the data that is currently languishing in silos. Wojcicki wants individuals to take control of this information to adapt their behaviour, arguing that this targeted data should be fully integrated into the health system to drive efficiencies and superior patient outcomes. Wojcicki's ideas seemed distant a decade ago when the human genome had just been mapped at a cost of £1.85 billion, and scientists and entrepreneurs were still establishing practical uses – and business models – or the determination of chemical base pairs. But her vision is closer now, partly because of 23andMe, which she cofounded with biologist Linda Avey (who has since left the company) and life-sciences and finance executive Paul Cusenza.

These have limited 23andMe's product offering in the US to a DNA ancestry service that offers information on what percentage of a customer's genome relates to particular populations across the world, making it easier to find relatives and trace paternal and maternal lineages. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has blocked the company's wider health offerings – risk factors for diseases, for instance – pending regulatory approval. Wojcicki wants health records to be as easy to access as online banking and her story, and that of her company, epitomises both the promises and the challenges of the ongoing worldwide genetics revolution. "It's your job to manage your health," she says. Despite having problems in the US, 23andMe's full service, including its personalised health report, launched in Canada in October and in the UK on December 2. 23andMe markets itself as a consumer-friendly personalised-genetics concern. But its product offering is wrapped around a core of hard, rigorous science. It starts with thousands upon thousands of vials of human saliva.

This DNA is then copied multiple times in a process called amplification, until it grows to the point where it can be genotyped (meaning the point at which differences can be determined when compared to other samples). In order to do this, the amplified DNA is cut into smaller pieces, which are then applied to a customised DNA chip, known as a microarray: a small glass slide with millions of microscopic beads on its surface. Each bead is attached to a "probe", a piece of DNA that matches one of the genetic variants that 23andMe tests. 23andMe doesn't sequence an entire genome – the human genome contains anywhere between ten million and 30 million genetic variants, many of them closely correlated, meaning certain variants are highly representative of thousands of others. So the company's scientists have selected tens of thousands of variants linked to various conditions and traits identified in genetic literature. Cut pieces of DNA stick to the matching DNA probes. A fluorescent signal on each probe tells which version of a certain genetic variant corresponds to the DNA being tested.

Wojcicki's own family has made lifestyle changes after receiving the results of 23andMe's genome mapping: her estranged husband, Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, was found to have a high risk factor for Parkinson's. "His mother has Parkinson's disease, he had another family member who has the disease, so he has a 50/50 chance of developing it," Wojcicki explains. "We're more proactive. We try to be aware. He exercises more, he drinks more coffee because that is associated with reducing the risk. Personally, I'm high risk for breast cancer, so I mitigated my alcohol consumption." It is September 2014 and Wojcicki is welcoming WIRED to the 23andMe office in the middle of the Google site in Mountain View, California. Wojcicki is the public face and voice of 23andMe, inseparable now from the product and its mission. By the time she emerged into public view, she'd already made a fortune as part of a Wall Street hedge fund. Jason Madara "Wall Street emphasises the point that my mother taught about the conflict of interest between health and money," she says. "From a Wall Street perspective, it's all about how to monetise issues like the obesity crisis or diabetes. It leads to the question about who makes money from me not getting sick? If you actually stay healthy, the system doesn't make money. Is that a conflict of interest?" READ NEXT Stay safe online with these cybersecurity tips from GCHQ Stay safe online with these cybersecurity tips from GCHQ By Kathryn Nave Sergey Brin started his company in 1998 in a garage owned by Wojcicki's sister Susan, who would later become the CEO of YouTube. Anne Wojcicki was brilliant and rich, in possession of a science degree from Yale and unafraid of, and deeply knowledgeable about, big business. She had grown up in the right place at the right time. It also helped that she was nerdy enough to sustain an all-consuming passion for genetic science. As the sequencing of the first human genome neared its completion in the mid-2000s, Wojcicki felt tremendous excitement about the potential health benefits. She could sense the potential of combining genomic science with big data. She envisioned a world where diseases could be targeted via millions of discrete genetic data points, and where everyone would have access to as much genetic health information as they needed. Countless lives would be saved and transformed. "23andMe starts this revolution," says Wojcicki. "If I really want to be healthy, we need to have a parallel consumer universe. You need to have ownership of your own information, you need to be proactive, you need to be the one taking charge." 23andMe launched with early funding from Brin, Google and Genentech. On November 17, 2007, the company announced the launch of its Personal Genome Service, at a cost to the public of $999. By 2008, the company was being featured on Oprah and had been awarded Time magazine's "Invention of the Year". The New York Times ran an article describing how 23andMe's saliva tubes were all the rage at the 2008 Davos conference. READ NEXT Marcus Krause's lung cancer wouldn't stop growing. Then he took a new kind of blood test Marcus Krause's lung cancer wouldn't stop growing. Then he took a new kind of blood test By João Medeiros Through his 23andMe profile, Brin learned that he was a carrier of LRRK2, a genetic mutation in the 12th chromosome that greatly increases his risk of developing Parkinson's. His mother, also a carrier, had contracted the disease. This gave 23andMe a little extra narrative push. Could the billionaire, via diet and exercise, turn back this horrible disease? Could his genome provide vital clues to a cure? When, in 2010, 23andMe's major competitor Pathway Genomics announced plans with the pharmacy chain Walgreens to put saliva kits in stores around the US, the federal government raised a red flag. Within 48 hours, the FDA had sent letters to every direct-to-market genetics company, having decided that the products were medical devices that required clearance. Other government agencies also put out warnings, saying that there were no clear standards for genetics testing. 23andMe wrote an open letter to various government agencies saying that it was willing to work to help establish those standards. The competition got scared off. Within two years, 23andMe's was the only over-the-counter genetic test available. It published papers about Parkinson's, announced research communities for sarcoma and other blood cancers and received a million-dollar grant from the US National Institutes of Health. By 2013, it was offering tests, providing data on more than 200 health markers, for $299. Further funding, taking the total from investors to $110m, was then used to drop the price to $99. The customer base shot up to 700,000 people on the back of the company launching a slick TV advertising campaign. Fast Company magazine featured Wojcicki on the cover, declaring her "The Most Daring CEO in America". READ NEXT How Facebook wants to save the world How Facebook wants to save the world By Cade Metz Then, on November 22, 2013, the hammer fell. The FDA sent Wojcicki an ominously titled "Warning Letter", telling her that, in essence, it was cutting 23andMe's operation off at the knees, threatening "seizure, injunction and civil money penalties". The letter took shots at the TV advertising campaign and seemed concerned that 23andMe was releasing allegedly inaccurate results. It also implied that, even if the results were accurate, people who received them wouldn't know what to do with them. "Everyone has the right to access and understand their personal genetic information," says Wojcicki. "It's amazing to me it's so controversial that you should be able to get your genetic information." On December 1, 2013, the company's website offered "reports on 240+ health conditions and traits". By December 5, it was promising merely "ancestry information" and "raw genetic data without interpretation". And that's where it stands for US customers today. 23andMe samples are prepared by LabCorp technicians in Los Angeles for DNA extraction Jason Madara READ NEXT Started from the bottom now he's here: how Drake became a generation's music tastemaker Started from the bottom now he's here: how Drake became a generation's music tastemaker By Stuart Dredge Soon, the lease on 23andMe's office on the Google campus will expire, meaning that the company will be relocating to what Wojcicki describes as an "extremely cool" new space downtown. The current space is an unremarkable warren of office cubicles and conference rooms but, in the middle of the site, there's a full gymnasium where, one afternoon, WIRED takes a yoga class as busy workers' keyboards clack all around. Every day, 23andMe employees receive a healthy, catered lunch, along with a full menu that includes a detailed description of the cheese of the day. When WIRED visits, it is "a Gouda-like cheese with a yellowish tan wax rind and pale-yellow flesh, made for three months during the spring, while the cows are feasting on meadow grass". The FDA sent Wojcicki an ominously titled 'warning letter', telling her it was cutting 23andMe's operation off at the knees, threatening 'seizure, injunction and civil money penalties' Some of that rarefied cheese is on display at a lunch meeting with Wojcicki. The CEO is wearing workout shorts, a jogging top and grey Chuck Taylor trainers; she has ridden several kilometres from home on an ElliptiGO, a £2,000 stand-up bike with training pads instead of pedals. 23andMe makes ElliptiGOs available to employees at all times. READ NEXT How Frieze Academy is making the art fair go global How Frieze Academy is making the art fair go global By Matt Cowan This is the only hour Wojcicki has free in her schedule for the following month, such is the cofounder's diary now that she's spending much of her time dealing with a federal agency. In the past, 23andMe has operated without a general counsel; Wojcicki has been distracted by having two young children, and hasn't been going to Washington as often as she could have. "We were out on a three-day off-site, talking about the next five-year plan," she says, recalling the regulatory intervention. "It never crossed my mind that the FDA would ask us to stop." But ask it did. After the FDA's intervention Wojcicki didn't leave her home office for seven days, calling everyone she could. "One of the best pieces of advice I got from a senior regulatory person in the Valley," she says. "We sat down, and she said, 'Are you trying to have a cash-out strategy? Because that's one path. But if you really want to change the system, and you want to dominate in ten years, that's a different strategy, and that's going to take patience. You have to hire the right people, you have to build a team.'" Wojcicki hired the best genetics lawyer she could find and engaged with the FDA. "We weren't speaking the right language for them," she says. "They didn't understand our process. I get it now." READ NEXT Amazon's vision for streaming independent films Amazon's vision for streaming independent films By Kathryn Nave For the past year Wojcicki has travelled to Washington every few weeks, meeting with Congress members, sitting on a prestigious genetics committee, and, most importantly, trying to satisfy the FDA's concerns. She's also been playing her high-powered tech celebrity card, attending a White House dinner wearing a Victoria Beckham gown, and, on a separate occasion, hosting President Obama at a $32,000-a-plate exclusive dinner at her private estate. The cultural gap between Washington and Silicon Valley can and will be bridged, she says. She's less sanguine, however, about the overall state of the US healthcare system. To her mind, recent reforms haven't changed much. Genetics still isn't taught in most medical schools. Therefore, physicians don't know the field, and the insurance apparatus that rules US healthcare knows and cares even less. The roadblocks are numerous and intense. "Everyone talks about the vision as though it's obvious," she says. "They're like, 'Oh yeah, we'll just cure cancer. In ten years, every child born today will be sequenced.' People talk about it like it's inevitable. But there's nothing I see that's happening today that's going to make that a reality. And, to be honest, I find that really depressing." But perhaps Wojcicki is too close to the situation to feel totally optimistic. Robert Green, head of the Genomes To People research project at Harvard University, is closely studying the impact of public access to genomic information. Green says 23andMe has "tapped into something primal". "The world is still figuring out how to use this information, and whether it's even useful on an individual basis," he says. "But people are genuinely interested in it. Personally, I believe it's going to change everything about the world we live in." Finding genetic markers for disease is just early-stage technology, thinks Green. As we continue to learn how genes affect our personal health, it's going to have profound consequences on how we conduct our daily lives. READ NEXT Meet the man behind the audiobook revolution Meet the man behind the audiobook revolution By Matt Cowan Jason Madara "As we start to decode this, it's going to influence how we eat, how we exercise, how we sleep, how we pick our jobs. I think this is the beginning of an era where biology interfaces with our lives likenelectronics do now, in ways that 20 years ago we couldn't even imagine." "We're sitting on the brink of a huge revolution in personalised medicine," says Eric Topol, professor of genomics at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, and author of the forthcoming book The Patient Will See You Now. 23andMe's work, he says, is just a precursor to a time when people can get their entire genome sequences for less than £100. That genome can and will be interpreted in ways that we can barely even begin to imagine, and it will be part of a digitally available, personalised suite of medical information that will be as easy to access as an app on a smartphone. "Genomics sits at the centre of that," he says. "I think there will be a world in which you will have lots of choices where you can get biological information about yourself," Green says. These could involve medical professionals or "alternative schemes" outside the traditional and established medical-care system. "Those choices will compete in the marketplace of ideas and of effectiveness. I don't think doctors are going to have the same lock on expertise that they once had." Wojcicki places "alternative schemes" at the core of her plan. To her mind, the future of genetics in the US lies in the retail sector. "I once had to run to Walmart in the middle of the day. First of all, it was packed. Second, I couldn't escape the blue water and the hot dogs spewing cheese. I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm in the heart of Silicon Valley, and I'm surrounded by horrible choices!'" Walmart recently announced an initiative to place doctors in its outlets. Similarly, Wojcicki wants to reach consumers in retail locations, sensing an enormous opportunity. "There has to be a monetisation aspect from every angle," she says. "The healthcare system really monetises diabetes because they can sell things for it. But as for wellness? That's retail, where you get your drugs and your yoga mats. Suddenly it'll be like, 'Oh, your genetic test shows you're at a high risk for diabetes. Aisle seven, running shoes.'" Her forecast is different for the UK, where long-term medical projects such as the Avon Longitudinal Study for Parents and Children or The Million Women Study are well established, funded, accepted by government and integrated into society. Wojcicki says that the NHS is more focused on preventative medicine than the American system is. "[The UK has an] amazing personalised health system where they contact people and people respond. We're so obsessed here about physician involvement and how information should be delivered. They're just not that worried about it. They're like, yeah, there's new information, it's coming and if we can use it to motivate people to do more for their health, that's great." In fact, the NHS has begun to undertake its own large-scale consumer-genetics project. Genomics England is collecting 100,000 genomes from NHS patients who have cancer or rare diseases, storing them securely and making the anonymous data available to medical and scientific researchers. The intention is to use that data to prevent, diagnose and treat disease. It is the first serious national attempt in the world to do such a thing. "The goal is to create a research database that will be for national and international researchers, and where commercial companies can come to prompt new treatments in the genomics industry," says Tom Fowler, Genomics England's director of public health. In the absence of a similar US initiative, 23andMe is attempting to build such a database privately. Customers have been remarkably willing to share their data: more than 80 per cent of them have opted in to allow their genetic information to be used in research studies. A radical idea – for-profit, crowdsourced genetics research – has allowed 23andMe to build an unusually powerful information bank. At the time of publication, the company has accumulated more than 800,000 genotypesfrom paid customers. It tallies approximately two million online-survey data points every week. All this data has allowed 23andMe to publish 16 peer-reviewed studies in the last three years. For instance, a couple of years ago, a pharmaceutical company whose name 23andMe cannot disclose made an approach. Desperately behind in its efforts to create a drug that could prevent people from developing Alzheimer's, it was looking for those who were at an increased genetic risk because they carry the predictive APOE gene. Specifically, it wanted to study high-risk people who hadn't yet manifested signs of Alzheimer's to understand why. Not only would the company have to find people older than 75 who carry that particular genetic variant, but it would also have to pinpoint which of those weren't affected – which would amount to approximately two per cent of those people. If conducted traditionally, such a survey could take a decade and cost millions, if it could be completed at all. 23andMe pulled it together in about ten months. An email went out to customers explaining what the company needed. There was a huge response and within days 23andMe assembled 550 people, of whom 80 were chosen for the study. 23andMe conducted remote phenotype tests, administered by clinicians, and sent them off for analysis. "One of our principles is that big data will improve your health and accelerate scientific discoveries," says Wojcicki. "If you have a big community of individuals from all around the world, with lifestyle and genetic information, you can almost solve all of the mysteries about the human body and disease." "[23andMe] has amalgamated the largest amount of common genetic variants on the planet and is a great force to promote the democratisation of genomics," says Eric Topol. ADVERTISEMENT So it's no wonder that Anne Wojcicki is busy. She's running a data concern that also happens to be a scientific research institute as well as a for-profit consumer company. And she's trying to make sure her government's regulatory apparatus stays off her back. At the core of her business, though, is a true reformatory agenda for medical research and healthcare. "The beautiful loophole in healthcare is that people own their own data," she says, "but the system makes it impossible to get it. Going back to my Wall Street days, we'd be on these conference calls about 'the human subjects', and the questions: 'Do insurance companies own the data; does the physician own the data?' No one is talking about the people. They should get the data. All these government studies, people are not consented to get their data back. It's too much work to return that. But it's your data." Wojcicki is determined to give you access to your own data. And, with your permission, she'll use it for research and turn her company into the global leader in personal genetics.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, March 15, 2017: Building Habit-Forming Products with Nir Eyal Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: Building Habit-Forming Products Hundreds of millions of people use Firefox every day. But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Host: Chris More Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, April 26, 2017: American Spies: Jennifer Granick on U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: American Spies: U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Intelligence agencies in the U.S. (aka the American Spies) are exceedingly aggressive, pushing and sometimes bursting through the technological, legal and political boundaries of lawful surveillance. Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security’s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Before teaching at Stanford, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California.

Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Previous Speakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #InclusiveDesign + #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Hashtag: #mozSS September 1: Being Human in a Data-Filled World with Genevieve Bell, Intel Location: Mozilla Portland + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 1 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Being Human in a Data-Filled World In May, Kevin Kelly shared the possibilities that technology will offer us over the next 30 years. Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services. Kirsten holds a BS degree in Finance from USC and an MBA from J.L. Kellogg School of Management. Host: David Slater Questions: Submit questions for Kirsten during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS March 24, 2016: The Role of a Product Manager with Josh Elman, Greylock Partners Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, March 24 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: The Role of a Product Manager - and Everyone Else "The job of a product manager is to help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.” Seems simple - but anyone who has worked on a product knows it’s not. At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Building products with partners, considerably moreso. Varying resources, goals, strategies and cultures pose challenges. But partnering well on products is often worth the effort. This month April Underwood, head of all product & partnerships at Slack, will draw from her experiences at Google, Twitter, Travelocity and more to help us navigate the complexities of marrying products and partnerships. She'll be interviewed by our very own Bertrand Neveux, who has built products with partners for most of his career at and leading up to Mozilla. Speaker: April Underwood is head of Platform at Slack, a messaging platform that has evolved into a diverse ecosystem of partners. There, she drives key growth initiatives and oversees platform products, partnerships, API integrations and developer relations. She previously worked on products for Travelocity, Apple, Google, Climate Corp (Weatherbill). Just before joining Slack, April led teams of Product Managers as Director of Product on Twitter’s fast-growing Advertising (Ads API, ads.twitter.com) and Data (Firehose, Gnip) products. She was also a PM for the Tweet Button and Twitter API, and built Twitter's Business Development team from the ground up to strike strategic partnerships with firms including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, EA, Salesforce and Adobe. And while she used to write code (and sometimes writes term sheets as an angel investor), her first love is building and leading product teams and working with engineers and designers to build and launch great products that people want to use.

Hashtags: #mozSS #brantina January 27, 2016: The Right Way to Build Software with Jocelyn Goldfein, ex-Facebook Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 27 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Right Way to Build Software: Ideals Over Ideology Add-ons. Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups. As Director of Engineering at Facebook she led Facebook’s push on mobile infrastructure and quality, initiating major new investments in architecture and tooling and helped guide Facebook’s transition to “mobile first.” She launched new product initiatives in search, news feed, and photos. She also drove strategic engineering operational initiatives, including overhauling Facebook’s approach to technical recruiting. More on Jocelyn at her website.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mike is also a co-author of the Responsive.org manifesto and a leading contributor to the global self-management and future of work movement.

User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News.

Search giant wrongly said shop closed down, refused to list the truth More like this Google Microsoft Bug Bounties Security Google, Microsoft bump bug bounties Googles' rise is permanent, Microsoft wants you to give Office 365 a beating Ooh-wee, ooh-wee ooooh ... wah, wah wah. Google and Microsoft are offering higher rewards to bug bounty hunters 6 Mar 2017 at 08:03, Simon Sharwood Google and Microsoft have both increased the cash on offer under their bug bounty programs. Google's increases are permanent, in recognition of what security program manager Josh Armour says is an environment in which “high severity vulnerabilities have become harder to identify over the years.” Google's therefore going to pay more to reflect the time it takes to find nasty flaws. Google's priority remains remote code execution flaws, which can now earn white hats up to US$31,337. Google's ceiling for payments used to be $20,000. Finding a bug that permits “unrestricted file system or database access” can now result in $13,337 heading your way, up from $10,000. A full list of what Google is looking for, and will pay for, can be found here. Microsoft's also increased its payouts, but only for two months and for a handful of services. The good news is that Redmond's doubled payouts for vulns that meet its criteria, namely any of the following: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Unauthorized cross-tenant data tampering or access (for multi-tenant services) Insecure direct object references Injection Vulnerabilities Authentication Vulnerabilities Server-side Code Execution Privilege Escalation Significant Security Misconfiguration (when not caused by user) The bonus bounties apply only on the following platforms. portal.office.com outlook.office365.com outlook.office.com *.outlook.com outlook.com Microsoft's not said why it's made the special offer for those domains, but clearly it feels they need to be given a thorough going-over. The Register can offer a couple guesses as to why. A simple reason could be that they just haven't attracted many bounty hunters. Another could be that they are running new code worthy of extra probing. The timing of the bloated bounty is also interesting, because as by the start of May we'll be very close to the launch of the Windows 10 Creators Update. That release, we already know, will link with Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection. Coincidence?

The internet giant reacted after a blog post highlighted unsubstantiated search results indicating former president Barack Obama was planning a "coup d'etat' and that four former US presidents were members of the Ku Klux Klan. The weekend post from Search Engine Land editor Danny Sullivan found Google delivered "terribly wrong" answers to some queries in its "one true answer" box at the top of search results and in queries to its Google Home speaker. "The problematic examples I review don't appear to have been deliberate attempts," Sullivan wrote. "Rather, they seem to be the result of Google's algorithms and machine learning making bad selections." Sullivan said when he asked the speaker if US Republicans were the same as Nazis, it answered in the affirmative. Similarly, he cited an example in which Google's search engine listed four former US presidents as "active and known" KKK members, even though there has been no conclusive historical evidence supporting that. The news comes amid a growing controversy over "fake news" circulating online via Google or Facebook, and efforts by the internet giants to weed out hoaxes and misinformation. In a statement to AFP, Google said its boxed results at the top of a search query, known as "featured snippets," are based on an algorithmic formula. "Unfortunately, there are instances when we feature a site with inappropriate or misleading content," Google's statement said. "When we are alerted to a featured snippet that violates our policies, we work quickly to remove them, which we have done in this instance. We apologize for any offense this may have caused." Google also noted it includes a "feedback" link under these snippets that can allow the search giant to flag or remove inappropriate content.

Do you want to become a Google Chrome power user? Read on! By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | March 6, 2017 -- 15:45 GMT (07:45 PST) | Topic: Cloud Do you use Google Chrome? Do you want to become a Google Chrome guru? Read on! What follows are a collection of tips, tricks, and tools to help you get the most from Google Chrome. There are tips on speeding up the browser and making it consume less RAM, ways to increase your privacy, and extensions that you can install to help you get more done in your day. Note: These tips work for both Mac and Windows (and many even work for Linux!). Give Google Chrome a tune-up Web browsers work hard, and mostly get little in the way of care and attention. But a little tune-up can go a long way to making Google Chrome faster and more efficient. #1: Update your Google Chrome browser If you've not closed Google Chrome in a while -- probably because you've got a whole bunch of tabs you're keeping open -- then perhaps there's an update waiting for you. You can easily tell if there's an update on later releases of Chrome because the menu button (the three vertical dots right of the address bar) will change from green to yellow and then red to give you a visual reminder of how out-of-date the browser you are running is. To force Chrome to check for an update type chrome://help into the address bar and follow the prompts. #2: Get rid of unwanted extensions Type chrome://extensions into the address bar and disable any unwanted extensions. Either uncheck the box to disable the extension or click on the trash can icon to delete it. Note that if you delete an extension you lose all the data associated with it (this does not happen if you disable it) #3: Get rid of unwanted plugins Type chrome://plugins into the address bar and disable any unwanted plugins. Just click the link to disable. #4: Control tabs with custom extensions The amount of tabs you have open at any one time has a direct impact on the performance of Chrome, as well as how much RAM the application consumes. Fortunately, it's possible to have a lot of tabs open and keep memory consumption under control with some extensions. Here are some for you to choose from: Tab Wrangler One Tab The Great Suspender Another thing you can do is strip the page down to just the text using an extension such as Text Mode or Minimalist. There are a lot of awesome Google Chrome extensions out there. I've listed a few in the gallery below (although I don't recommend that you install all of them!). #5: Install the Data Saver extension If your problem is related more to a poor internet connection than it is to a sluggish browser, then one way you can help improve bandwidth is to install the Google Data Saver extension. This extension uses the Google servers to compress and optimize web pages before they are delivered to your browser. #6: Close your browser! You really don't have to have your browser running the whole time! Really, you don't. You can customize Google Chrome to reopen exactly where you were when you closed it. Type chrome://settings and under On startup you'll see three options: Open the New Tab page Continue where you left off Open a specific page or set of pages If you want Google Chrome to fire up where you left it, choose Continue where you left off, or if you want to start up from a custom set of pages, choose Open a specific page or set of pages and select those pages. One word of caution -- be careful if you have multiple browser windows open, because only the tabs from the last window you closed will be reopened. Tip: If you accidentally close a tab, you can recover it by pressing Ctrl + Shift + T on Windows or Linux, or ⌘ + Shift + T on a Mac. #7: Run with the default theme You can do a lot of customizing of Google Chrome, including changing the theme. However, themes eat RAM, so if you want the speediest possible browser, run with the default theme. Type chrome://settings and under Appearance, if the Reset to default theme button isn't greyed out then you're running a custom theme. Click the button to go back to the default. #8: Smoother scrolling Type chrome://flags into the address bar and find Enable fast tab/windows close. This option speeds up Chrome by allowing it to close windows separate to any JavaScript code that might be running. After you've made changes click the RELAUNCH NOW button at the bottom of the screen to apply the setting. Note that this is an experimental feature and be sure to read the warnings at the top of the settings page in Chrome. To undo any changes click the Reset all to default button. #9: Clear your cache If you're getting low on disk space then you might find Chrome will speed up if you clear the cache. Type chrome://settings/clearBrowserData into the address bar and I'd suggest choosing only the Cached images and files option. Alternatively, you can nuke everything and start with a clean slate. For best results clear items from the beginning of time.

It might also be a good idea to scan the system using something such as Malwarebyte's Anti-Malware. Mac users can check out Malwarebyte's Anti-Malware for Mac (don't believe the nonsense that Macs can't have viruses or malware -- that may have been true a decade ago, but it's not true today). Power up Google Chrome with extensions Google Chrome is so much more than a web browser. It's a platform, and with a few key extensions installed you can transform it into a command center for your day-to-day work. Whether it's productivity, security, or enhanced automation you are after, there's an extension that can help you achieve that goal. Top Google Chrome extensions for security,... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 64 NEXT PREV Make Google Chrome use less battery life While I'm a big fan of Google Chrome, I'm also the first to admit that it isn't without its flaws, and one of those being that it can be quite a bit of a battery hog. Here are a series of tips to help you rein in Google Chrome's thirst for power! How to make Google Chrome use less battery... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 6 NEXT PREV Quick Google Chrome tips Here are a bunch of Google Chrome tips that will make your day easier and life more productive. One of the best ways to become a total Google Chrome power user is to learn how to control the browser using shortcut keys. You can select multiple tabs for dragging -- hold down Ctrl on Windows or ⌘ on the Mac and click on the tabs you want to select. Reopen a tab you've accidentally closed with Ctrl + Shift + T on Windows or ⌘ + Shift + T on the Mac (you can reopen up to ten previously closed tabs). You can play any media file on your computer that's supported by Google Chrome by dragging it into a browser window. Google Chrome has its own task manager -- click the menu button that lives to the right of the address bar (the button with the three vertical dots), go to More Tools and then choose Task Manager. You can use the spacebar to scroll down a webpage, and you can scroll back up by pressing Shift + Spacebar. You know that T-Rex Google Chrome shows you when you lose connection to the internet (you can access the page by going to chrome://network-error/-106 )? If you press the spacebar, the T-Rex will jump and kick off a simple game where you have to jump over cacti, Mario-style.

Steve Dent, @stevetdent 17h ago in Robots Comments 834 Shares Share Tweet Share Save AOL Google is once again showing the benefits of human curation when it comes to fake news. Several sources have noticed that Google Home is reading back very bad information in response to questions like "is Obama planning a coup?" Citing the very dubious "Secrets of the Fed" site, it replies that "not only could Obama be in bed with the Communist Chinese, but Obama may in fact be planning a Communist coup d'etat at the end of his term in 2016!" So why is Google giving you this right-wing conspiracy acid-trip? Basically, it's quoting Google's own "featured snippets," results that show up at the top of the page for certain search terms. Unlike the "Knowledge Graph," which shows reliable, well-sourced replies, featured snippets "provide an automatic and algorithmic match to a given search query," Google told Recode. In other words, the information is first surfaced by a bot from not-necessarily-reliable sources, then read back to you by Google Home (powered by Google Assistant AI). The device focuses on featured snippets because it would be impractical to read a list of search results. By contrast, Amazon's Alexa also tries to answer queries, but according to Recode, it simply says that "I can't find the answer to the question I heard" in response to the same Obama question. Google definitely knows about the issue, saying "unfortunately, there are instances when we feature a site with inappropriate or misleading content." For now, it's fixing bad results on a case-by-case basis when they're reported. So, why doesn't it just scrub the featured snippets program until it can be sure the results are reliable? Apparently, people love the easy-to-digest results, and "it's having a very good impact on the search results," a consultant told The Outline last year. In other words, it's too good for Google's bottom line, so it probably won't change things unless it turns into a full-on PR nightmare.

But an artificial intelligence (AI) program owned by Alphabet, Google's parent company, may be able to do it much, much faster. DeepMind, an artificial intelligence company also owned by Alphabet is working to tell the difference between healthy and cancerous tissue as well as discover if metastasis has occured. "Metastasis detection is currently performed by pathologists reviewing large expanses of biological tissues. This process is labour intensive and error-prone," explained DeepMind in a white paper outlining the study.

"Our method leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and obtains state-of-the-art results on the Camelyon16 dataset in the challenging lesion-level tumour detection task."

The internet giant reacted after a blog post highlighted unsubstantiated search results indicating former president Barack Obama was planning a "coup d'etat' and that four former US presidents were members of the Ku Klux Klan. The weekend post from Search Engine Land editor Danny Sullivan found Google delivered "terribly wrong" answers to some queries in its "one true answer" box at the top of search results and in queries to its Google Home speaker. "The problematic examples I review don't appear to have been deliberate attempts," Sullivan wrote. "Rather, they seem to be the result of Google's algorithms and machine learning making bad selections." Sullivan said when he asked the speaker if US Republicans were the same as Nazis, it answered in the affirmative. Similarly, he cited an example in which Google's search engine listed four former US presidents as "active and known" KKK members, even though there has been no conclusive historical evidence supporting that. The news comes amid a growing controversy over "fake news" circulating online via Google or Facebook, and efforts by the internet giants to weed out hoaxes and misinformation. In a statement to AFP, Google said its boxed results at the top of a search query, known as "featured snippets," are based on an algorithmic formula. "Unfortunately, there are instances when we feature a site with inappropriate or misleading content," Google's statement said. "When we are alerted to a featured snippet that violates our policies, we work quickly to remove them, which we have done in this instance. We apologize for any offense this may have caused." Google also noted it includes a "feedback" link under these snippets that can allow the search giant to flag or remove inappropriate content.

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Firefox’s new WebExtensions permission system By Martin Brinkmann on March 6, 2017 in Firefox - Last Update:March 6, 2017 11 Mozilla plans to turn on a permissions system for the installation of WebExtensions in the Firefox web browser that is similar to that of Google Chrome. Whenever you install an extension in Google Chrome, all of the extra permissions that the extension requests are listed in the installation prompt. The idea is to provide users with information on these extra permissions, so that abusive extensions can be avoided. The main issue with the permissions system is that most users are probably ignoring the permissions prompt. One reason for that is that it is often difficult to find out whether a permission is really needed for functionality, or if it is simply there for marketing or outright malicious purposes. Firefox's new WebExtensions permission system Mozilla plans to launch similar installation permissions in Firefox 54 at the earliest, but most likely in Firefox 55. Firefox will display the extra permissions an extension requires during installation. The current iteration lists all permissions, but no additional information about them in the interface. The permissions come from the manifest.json file of the extension. If you open it in a plain text editor, or a special json viewer (for instance the json viewer of Firefox), you find them listed under the permissions section. This is true for Chrome and Firefox WebExtensions. Please note that you need to extract the extensions file first to get a listing of files included. Google published a page that lists all optional Chrome permissions that extensions may declare, and Mozilla published one as well. The permissions are not identical at this point in time, and it seems unlikely that they will ever be identical. Mozilla plans to support more APIs, and with that may come extra permissions that only Firefox supports. The installation prompt listing the permissions the extension requires is triggered whenever a WebExtension is installed in Firefox. This includes installations from Mozilla AMO and third-party websites, extensions that get side-loaded, and during upgrades. Firefox users who are interested in the feature can enable it right now. Please note that this landed in Firefox 53 Nightly, and that the permission does not exist by default (yet). If you run at least Firefox 53, you may do the following to enable the permission prompts when installing WebExtensions in the Firefox web browser: Load about:config in the Firefox address bar and hit the Enter-key. Confirm that you will be careful if the warning page opens. Right-click in the main area on about:config, and select New > Boolean. Name that Boolean extensions.webextPermissionPrompts. Set it to true. Any WebExtension installation afterwards triggers the installation prompt that highlights the requested permissions. The main tracking bug for the feature is 1308292. Additional information is provided on Mozilla's Wiki website. While we are at it: check out Firefox's permissions manager, and the new permissions system that Mozilla plans to launch. Now You: Do you find the installation prompts useful? Summary Article Name Firefox's new WebExtensions permission system Description Mozilla plans to turn on a permissions system for the installation of WebExtensions in the Firefox web browser that is similar to that of Google Chrome.

ArpitNext March 6, 2017 at 6:30 pm # @Andy: Of Course! In fact, I've subscribed to Firefox Category RSS Feeds* of Ghacks. My only source of what's up with the Mozilla and its browser. 👍 (*Link: http://www.ghacks.net/category/firefox/feed/) Kevin March 6, 2017 at 4:43 pm # Thanks Martin for the tip. And Firefox devs are trying to copy chome still (instead of adding apis to webext to bring functionality parity) But they choose to ignore major problems like these https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=610357 Reply OK March 7, 2017 at 4:45 am # So it's actually a bug? I thought it's the way firefox works. It's quite annoying to lost the url if the page fail to load Reply trek100 March 6, 2017 at 5:52 pm # I have __lots__ of useful FF addons working great in FF (and in Pale Moon!). Will my current FF addons still work in the new FF 54?. Will there be FF "WebExtensions" equivalent in functionality to my addons?. Will the conversion from current addons be "automatic" or "manual" (one by one)? Not being able to use my current FF addons anymore, would mean my dropping FF forever, and migrating 100% to Pale Moon or Chrome or Vivaldi. using: - Ubuntu Linux 12.04, 32-bit - FF and Pale Moon browsers. Reply insanelyapple March 6, 2017 at 7:50 pm # Can I actually add extension and following the example shown here, deny it accessing tabs? Or this works in fashion "agree or you won't use it"? If webextensions permissions works the other way, would be it possible then to create an extension that would take in charge permissions for other extensions? Reply Martin Brinkmann March 6, 2017 at 7:59 pm # It is allow permissions and use, or disallow any permission as you can't install it then. You could in theory try and edit the extension, and remove permissions. Reply Sören Hentzschel March 7, 2017 at 12:21 am # It's all or nothing at the moment. Optional permissions are another feature coming to Firefox.

At least, that’s what Google says. The Californian search giant is being criticised because of how it promotes fake news and wild conspiracy theories on its smart home device and in its search results via the Featured Snippets feature — including the nutty claim that Obama is “in bed with the Communist Chinese.” Below is a video — filmed by the BBC’s Rory Cellan-Jones — of Google Home spouting the nonsense answer. He asks the smart-home device “is Obama planning a coup?”, to which it replies that “Obama may in fact be planning a Communist coup d’etat at the end of his term in 2016.” In another test “Google Home” says Republicans are nazis. source: businessinsider.com And here’s what happens if you ask Google Home “is Obama planning a coup?” pic.twitter.com/MzmZqGOOal — Rory Cellan-Jones (@ruskin147) March 5, 2017 Google Home: “Yes, republicans = nazis” pic.twitter.com/7HVQjyjbEq — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) March 5, 2017   Tags With: chinesecommunistscoupgooglenazisobamarepublicans ← How would NASA deal with incoming asteroid (video) Greek army cadets impressive display!

Rick Osterloh, SVP of Google Hardware, has already confirmed that a Pixel 2 is in the works and it will “stay premium”. However, there are rumblings that another variant of the Pixel is in the works which may raise some eyebrows. As we’ve stated before, there were some that threw their arms in the air when Google announced the pricing for the Pixel, as it marked the end of Nexus pricing, which was nestled around the mid-range market. However, at $800, the Pixel is definitely not aimed for those looking for a stock experience on a budget. Previous rumors suggested that Google was working on a “budget Pixel 2”, but that device may not be exactly what we think it is. According to sources speaking to Stephen with 9to5Google, there is a budget variant of the Pixel 2 being developed, but it may be released under the Android One branding. This means that the device will be released in emerging markets, while not being available in the US at all. This will definitely disappoint many of us who were hoping for a mid-range Pixel device to help us get over the death of the Nexus branding. There is a lot of time between now and the official launch of the Pixel 2 so things are likely to change dramatically between now and then. Regardless, we’ll keep hoping for a Pixel/Nexus device priced around $400-$500. Let us know what you think about this, and if you’ll spring for the Pixel 2 if a budget option isn’t available.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Technology Companies Google doesn't really know what it's doing with its Assistant Assistant AI is coming to cars, TVs and smart-home devices – but is it fit for purpose? By David Gilbert Updated March 6, 2017 16:10 GMT Scott Huffman, engineering director at Google, speaks about Google Assistant during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, US October 4, 2016REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach In May 2016, Google unveiled Assistant, a voice-controlled personal (you guessed it) assistant that would answer user's questions, prompt them about upcoming meetings and generally interact with them like a real person would. At the time it was limited to Google's Home speaker and integrated into the Allo app. Despite this, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Assistant would offer "an ambient experience that extends across devices." As it was limited to a speaker and an app, how it was going to achieve this was unclear at the time. Things became slightly more clear in October when the company released the first truly Google smartphone – the Pixel. The phone had Assistant deeply embedded inside the version of Android running on the device and we could finally see how this was a potentially powerful alternative to Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Alexa. Is Google Assistant on all Android phones? No one really knew. Until last week that it, when Google announced that it would be bringing Assistant to smartphones running recent versions of Android from manufacturers like Huawei, LG and Samsung. Assistant is also embedded in Android Wear 2.0 devices and it is also set to be included in future versions of Android TV and Android Auto. The question is, why was Google's strategy of opening up Assistant to a range of services and devices not made explicit in May of last year when it launched? Maybe, Google just doesn't really know what it's doing. For all that Google likes to be known for its moonshots and wacky offices, what the company – now known as Alphabet – is built on, is selling ads. What makes this possible is its search engine, which dominates the internet and works so well because it gets better with the more information which is fed into it. With voice seen by many as the main computing paradigm of the coming decades, Google is in a position to dominate once again. Its Android operating system accounts for over 80% of all new smartphones sold, and even if only a fraction of these devices had Assistant built-in, then it would make it easily the most used digital assistant on the planet. Instead, Google chose exclusivity – initially at least. Making Pixel more mega? Most people saw the move as an attempt to make the Pixel phones more attractive over the multitude of options on the market today, everything from iPhones to Samsung's Galaxy S7 and beyond. The official reason Google gave for failing to outline its strategy from the beginning? "It was a new product and we wanted to make sure we took the baby steps required," Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Assistant said. So six months down the line is Assistant now the perfect digital companion, and ready for use on all smartphones? After using the Pixel smartphone since it launched, I can confirm that it is not. Assistant is getting better, but still has a long way to go to become the seamless and reliable service Google promises. As technology analyst Ben Thompson points out: "The surest route to a useful product is not through building the perfect assistant, but through building an iterative process that results in continuous improvement." If Google is now trying to spin that it planned all along to make Assistant widely available, then it begs another question – why didn't it tell its OEM partners? Keeping shtum at Sasmsung Samsung is by far the biggest Android smartphone maker, and critical to the continued success of the platform, given it launches smartphones in pretty much every single price bracket. But it seems as if Google didn't inform the South Korean company of its plans, given that Samsung spent a lot of money to acquire Viv, a AI-power assistant built by the creators of Siri. According to people familiar with Samsung's plans, the company will later this month launch its own Bixby assistant on the Galaxy S8 smartphone, deeply integrating it into its version of the Android operating system. Of course Samsung will struggle to make Bixby as compelling as Google's Assistant given the relative dearth of information it will have to learn from, but it also means that Samsung won't be feeding any information directly to Google's assistant. Huawei, the world's second biggest Android smartphone maker is reportedly building its own digital assistant, albeit for the Chinese market only, but should it prove a success, then there is no reason it won't be included on all Huawei smartphones in the future. So either Google has completely changed it strategy towards its Assistant in the space of six months, or it singularly failed to inform its biggest partners of its plans. Either way, if Google wants Assistant to emerge as the de facto voice interface for billions of people around the globe, it needs to get its message right, and begin telling the world exactly what it plans on doing.

It warns people not to trust their mapping apps.

Smartphone apps like Waze, a godsend for some road warriors because they shave minutes and even hours off their commutes with their creative detours off main highways, are causing headaches for city planners. Using crosswalks, wider sidewalks and traffic lights, these transportation engineers aim to make neighborhood traffic slow, safe, and friendly for pedestrians — not send frustrated commuters barreling down side roads. But the GPS-enabled computer programs often don't know that, or care. Their creators, such as Waze (owned by Google), are sympathetic, to a degree. They may give cities tips on how to effectively game the program so a neighborhood detour doesn't seem that appealing. But at the end of the day, the purpose of the bots is to make use of all available road space, main thoroughfare or country lane. The upshot is mounting frustration from cities, which are trying to thwart computer systems that are savvier than ever. "Don't trust your apps!" reads one road sign in Fremont, a city of 225,000 people just north of San Jose. Located off the heavily congested 880 and 680 freeways, it's situated between major San Jose-area employers like Intel, Cisco Systems and eBay, and the more affordable housing suburbs in California's Central Valley. More coverage: Love Waze? You could use it to carpool soon NBC's Keith Morrison is the new voice of Waze Waze's growth chief: Even driverless cars need a better route With highways frequently congested, navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze started telling drivers to hop off the freeway at Fremont's Mission Boulevard, cut through residential streets and then hop back on the highway where things were clearer — much to the distress of the people who lived there. “The commuters didn’t live or work in Fremont and didn’t care about our residential neighborhoods,” said Noe Veloso, Fremont’s principal transportation engineer. When he contacted the navigation apps, he was told the apps attempt to prevent congestion by distributing traffic on all public streets, even to quiet residential roadways. The only way to stop the drivers was to change the street routing so these shortcuts were no longer that. So Fremont instituted commute-hour turn restrictions on the most heavily used residential cut-through routes. The city also partnered with Waze through its Connected Citizens Program in order to share data and information, such as the turn restrictions, so that the app takes them into account. The result has been effective, but Veloso is worried the changes may simply reroute commuters into other neighborhoods. "We’re just trying to find a balance, to eliminate some of the time savings that's sending people into our streets," Veloso said. Fremont's situation is playing out in towns and cities across the U.S., with municipal planners just starting to grasp the scope of the challenge. “Waze and Uber hit transportation planners so fast that we didn’t know what to do,” says Sam Schwartz, a former traffic coordinator for New York City. His 1992 book New York Shortcuts and Traffic Tips was a popular precursor to the systems and apps that have been downloaded by hundreds of millions of users. A sign warning drivers in Fremont, Calif. that they can no longer turn left between 3:00 - 7:00 pm, part of an effort to keep commuters from using the town as a freeway shortcut.  (Photo: Noe Veloso) At a conference of transportation engineers this summer, Schwartz said the topic was being discussed in the hallways but not yet in plenaries. “We need to get ahead of this, but we don’t know what to do,” he said. Cities are struggling to get their arms around the issues the apps raise. Boston's winding streets, some of which date back to cow paths from the 17th century, make the city especially prone to drivers taking shortcuts and back routes to get around congestion. Jascha Franklin-Hodge, the city’s chief information officer, thinks most drivers are only using traffic apps for longer trips at this point. But once they start using them in their own neighborhoods, or if cars start to integrate mapping technology into their systems, or when self-driving cars come into play in the future, then the anecdotal issues he’s hearing about today “will just be the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “We can’t force an app maker to embed communal goals into their app,” he said. Waze's goal: Use all streets There is some communication between cities and the major apps. Boston, for example, uses Waze traffic jam data to help it time traffic lights in the downtown harbor area. That information helped reduce congestion by 18% month over month, according to the company. But in the end, as Fremont found, Waze believes that public roads are intended to be used by all citizens, including to alleviate gridlock. “We use the streets within reason. We find the open road and spread cars across the grid, which lowers the risk of unsafe driving behavior,” said Julie Mossler, Waze’s head of brand and global marketing. Neither Google Maps nor Apple Maps responded to requests for comment. Mapping software does have the power to slow a route down. It sets what’s known as the free flow traffic value, the time it takes to traverse a given roadway based on the physical conditions, and it's generally set to the legal speed limit. But getting those programs to lower the upper limit isn’t easy. There are too many neighborhoods, too many roads and it’s all too site-specific. Even getting a single area changed would be cost prohibitive to the app makers because it could potentially require staffers to make on-going micro updates. Waze says it hasn’t gotten any such requests. The intersection of Bosworth and Diamond Streets in San Francisco, where city planners have worked to calm traffic by removing car lanes.  (Photo: Elizabeth Weise) There’s also an inherent conflict of interest between the mapping software and the cities. “In the conflict between getting you there fast versus the neighbors who are upset about drive-through traffic, Waze’ business is with the drivers — because if you’re not getting value you’ll go use Apple Maps or TomTom,” said Mark Hallenbeck of the University of Washington in Seattle and director of the Washington State Transportation Center Today, many planners say the only alternative cities have is by physically changing street layouts. After spending decades building streets that let drivers get from Point A to Point B as fast as possible, they’re beginning to rethink the whole thing. "If you have residential streets where drivers feel comfortable doing 40 miles per hour, you didn’t do a very good job of designing them in the first place,” said Jennifer Dill, director of the National Institute for Transportation and Communities and a professor of urban planning at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. On top of that, many of the things that used to slow people down don’t anymore. “In 1953, your Chevy made a lot of noise and it gave you physical cues to tell you you were driving fast. Now in a modern car, there’s good sound deadening and you get no auditory or physical sense of how fast you’re going,” said Washington's Hallenbeck. To deal with this, city planners are contemplating redesigning roads that eliminate shortcuts or use one-way streets that prevent computers from using them as an alternative to a main thoroughfare. Seattle’s already begun this process. Its traffic engineers have spent years remaking streets so that it’s impossible to speed. They've rebuilt residential intersections as roundabouts and allowed parking on both sides of the street side to cut the useable driving space down from 36 feet to 12 feet. But sometimes these plans backfire. And municipal authorities are aware that the bots are always one or even 10 steps ahead.

The city spent 16 months and $3.1 million to reconfigure the intersection of Bosworth and Diamond streets in the Glen Park neighborhood. The heavily-used intersection includes bike lanes, lots of pedestrians, children and parents walking to an elementary school a block away, a stop for tech buses heading to Silicon Valley workplaces, a BART subway stop and multiple bus routes. The work was part of a Vision Zero plan to reduce the number of traffic fatalities to zero. It cut the number of lanes in each direction from three to two, widened the sidewalks, took out bus stops so buses now stop in the roadway and added a planted median and turn lanes. The new design is meant to be safer for pedestrians, better for transit and to discourage speeding by drivers. An unintended consequence has been an increase in drivers using mapping software that sends them down the narrow streets that traverse the neighborhood’s steep hillsides, said resident Katherine Murphy. She’s angry at the city for presuming everyone would play nice and only use the main intersection. “Do they just have their heads in the sand that people are using technology?” she said. Hallenbeck likens it to efforts to dam small streams. “The water often finds a new route around the dam. And that's what is happening in San Francisco. People are finding a new path of least resistance.” Neighbor Lexi Olian isn’t enjoying being part of that downstream effect.

Whether you are organizing your getaway How To Use The Power Of Social Networks To Plan The Perfect Trip How To Use The Power Of Social Networks To Plan The Perfect Trip Remember travel agents?

Read More with a family of six or just your significant other, take advantage of Google Keep’s collaboration feature. This lets everyone stay in the loop with the plans and keeps all travel items in one spot. For instance, you can create notes with full details for each part of the trip. You might have notes for the resort accommodations, flight information, weather forecast, and boarding details for a pet. Each note can include text, links, images, and lists. Then add collaborators to each one and your group will have access to it all. Just click the collaborator icon on the note and enter your friend or family member’s email address in the pop-up box. They will receive an email with the title of the note and a link to open it in Google Keep. You can add more than one collaborator, making it perfect for planning with a group. Google Keep can help take the stress out of planning a trip for more than one person with its valuable collaboration feature. Decide on Activities With Annotations For deciding on destinations, activities, and travel routes, you can upload, edit, and share images with Google Keep Google Keep Brings Text Recognition To Images In The Latest Version Google Keep Brings Text Recognition To Images In The Latest Version Google Keep is now appears stylized with a new orange action bar. The note-taking app now also gives you a feature to search printed text in images. Read More . And by using the image annotation and collaboration features together, everybody can have a say in the travel plans. For example, maybe you are planning a trip to Orlando, Florida and need to decide which theme parks to visit. You can grab a screen shot of the map, pop it into a note in Google Keep, and let your group circle the spots they want to visit. To edit an image, you simply click on it from the note and then select the Annotate Image icon from the top right. The image will then open in a small window with a pen, marker, and highlighter to mark it up. You can also pick from several colors for the tools, so each person can use a different one. This is a great way to organize every one’s preference. Edits that others make to the note will automatically update for everyone to see and will include an Updated indicator. So everyone that you shared the note with can not only add their two cents, but stay up to date too. Don’t Forget a Thing, Make a List or Two Google Keep has a wonderful checklist feature that you can use to keep your plans in order. And you will likely need more than one list for your trip. First, you can create a list of all travel plans that need to be made. You might include booking a hotel, comparing flights, arranging a rental car, and mapping out activities. Then as you complete each part of the plan, just mark it off the list. Next, you can plan your packing with the Google Keep checklist feature. Add your clothes, shoes, accessories, and toiletries in just minutes. If you like to plan your packing by day, you can create a list for each day during your trip to ensure that you have enough, and not too many, items. Going on a road trip? Make a list of maintenance tasks on the vehicle before your trip. You may need to check the oil, tire pressure, and fluids, purchase new windshield wiper blades, and give it a good cleaning. You can share lists with the others in your travel party. So it is handy if each person takes care of an item on the list. You can also use Google Keep on your mobile phone 7 Tips for Taking Better Notes in Google Keep for Android 7 Tips for Taking Better Notes in Google Keep for Android If you use Google Keep for Android, these tips will make your experience a much better one. Read More . This makes marking off list items convenient no matter where you are when you complete them. Download — Google Keep for Android (Free) | iOS (Free) Remember to Confirm Bookings When you plan a trip that includes a variety of parts, it can be easy to forget something. If you are booking accommodations, flights, and a rental car, you may want to confirm your reservations. Google Keep has a useful reminder feature built-in. For instance, you may have a note for the hotel you have reserved. The note can include a link to the hotel’s website, photos you captured from the site, a list of amenities, and the email confirmation attached. Then just set up a reminder to confirm your reservation. Another good example for using reminders is when you are comparing flights. You might have a note that includes links to the airline or travel assistance sites, a list of airfares found with dates and times, and your flight budget. You can create a convenient reminder to check airfares regularly until you find the right deal. Have you ever needed to book an activity? If you are planning on taking a tour, renting equipment, or reserving a table at an exclusive restaurant, use the reminders. You might try to make arrangements only to discover that the facility is closed at that time or they have asked you to call back closer to the requested date. Pop a reminder onto the note that has the activity details and you will not forget to follow up. Reminders can be time and date or location-based for flexibility and you can have them repeat if needed. These helpful notifications can keep you on track with your plans. And, again, if you use the mobile Google Keep app, you can receive reminders on-the-go. Create Cultural Notes Once you begin making travel plans, you have likely selected your destination. You have researched it, looked at maps, and read helpful tips for your spot. Plus, you kept all information in a handy Google Keep note. But if you are traveling abroad Traveling Overseas?

Read More , there is more to know than the basics. Consider creating a note with cultural details. This could include links to currency converter and translation tools, a list of common words and phrases in the local language, differences in food offerings, and details for attire. You should note those important things about the country you are visiting so that everyone in your travel party can access them. Being prepared for overseas travel is a must and this is one way that Google Keep can help.

These ten top travel blogs and globe-trotting tips can take you to most exciting destinations in the world even on a budget. Read More . One way to stay in touch with the group when this happens is to set up check-in notes ahead of time. A check-in note can prevent anxiety. You can create a note for each day during the trip for parties to check in. They can quickly type in the time and their location and then upload an image from their spot. You can set up reminders on the notes if needed, which is convenient so that no one forgets. Just keep in mind that each person must create their own reminder — these are not shared on the notes. This is a terrific method for checking in with your group while on the trip. And it is a great way to enjoy details and photos together after the trip has ended. Finalize Your Itinerary Once your travel plans have been made, reservations have been confirmed, and the details are safe in Google Keep, it’s time to create the itinerary.

Where is Komodo National Park? Google doodle marks the park’s 37th anniversary Designed by Google doodlers from the art, engineering and production staff, the doodle doubles as an interactive quiz. Amy Gesenhues on March 6, 2017 at 9:47 am More Today’s Google doodle marks the 37th anniversary of the Komodo National Park, located in West Manggarai Regency, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Originally created to provide a safe harbor for the 5,700 Komodo dragons that live there, Google says the park’s wildlife inhabitants are far-ranging. “In addition to the Timor deer, which is the main source of food for the Komodo dragon, the islands are also the habitat for 72 species of birds, such as the yellow-crested cockatoo,” reports the Google Doodle Blog, “Thousands of fish species swim in the surrounding waters, as well as sea turtles, dolphins, and whales.” The Komodo Dragon Park doodle doubles as an interactive quiz that takes users through a series of five true-false questions. At the end of the quiz, instead of linking to a single specific search related to the doodle (like most Google doodles), users are offered four different questions about the Komodo dragon that lead to corresponding search results. The art for the doodle was created by Alyssa Winans, Diana Tran and Kevin Laughlin. Engineering staff included Jonathan Shneier and Mark Ivey, and My-Linh Le handled production. In addition to the doodle, Google shared the following images and Komodo facts on its Doodle blog: “Like sharks, Komodo dragon teeth are replaceable.” “Komodo dragons have flexible skulls.” “Komodo dragons are related to snakes.” About The Author Amy Gesenhues Amy Gesenhues is Third Door Media's General Assignment Reporter, covering the latest news and updates for Search Engine Land and Marketing Land.

Google ‘related picks’ now showing under some top stories carousels Google looks to show you more AMP top stories by adding a query expansion feature in the mobile search results. Barry Schwartz on March 6, 2017 at 10:13 am More Google has added a new feature to the top stories carousel named “related picks.” Related picks may show up under the top stories AMP carousel, and aims at giving searchers another way to expand their queries to see even more top story content. If you search on mobile for a news-oriented keyword phrase, the top stories AMP carousel will likely show up. Then below that carousel, there may be a new section named “related picks.” Clicking on the phrases below the related picks will expand to show you more top stories carousel items. Here is a picture of the feature collapsed: When you click on one, it expands and shows you more top stories: Hat tip to @glenngabe for spotting this.

The internet giant’s smart speaker, Google Home, offered a very bizarre response when asked “is Obama planning a coup?” And here's what happens if you ask Google Home "is Obama planning a coup?" pic.twitter.com/MzmZqGOOal— Rory Cellan-Jones (@ruskin147) March 5, 2017 The BBC’s Rory Cellan-Jones shared a video on social media, in which Google Home responds: “According to details exposed in Western Centre for Journalism’s exclusive video, not only could Obama be in bed with the communist Chinese, but Obama may in fact be planning a communist coup d'etat at the end of his term in 2016.” Danny Sullivan‏, editor of Search Engine Land, also noted the same result appeared up if you typed the query into Google. It has now been removed.  If you're wondering if Obama is planning a coup, Google's "one true answer" is yes.

This aspect of online marketing can be even more intimidating if you have a small marketing budget and can’t throw money at your marketing strategy like your largest competitors can. Fear not! I am here today to let you know that you can build a robust SEO strategy even if you work on a shoestring budget. However, while you can grow your business on a budget SEO plan, I don’t want to give you the illusion that you can compete with the mega-corporations in your market right away. This is because many corporate competitors have spent millions of dollars and have decades of content on their side. Those companies have a substantial head start that will dilute your SEO strategy if not done the right way. However, there are proven methods that your business can use to build a powerful online presence without needing to break the bank! Small Budget SEO for Big ROI Since you want to create an SEO strategy on a shoestring budget, you will need to use your time and resources efficiently. Instead of relying on a monthly budget of thousands of dollars, you will need to use your creativity and hyper-focus your efforts on an SEO strategy that will yield the greatest results. It’s easy to get overwhelmed with the details and complexities of a large SEO strategy. Blogging, branding, backlinking, local SEO, etc. are all important aspects of a business plan, but they also take a lot of knowledge and experience to run efficiently. Instead of getting lost in the forest of information, let’s focus on specific actions you can take to grow your online presence with a small SEO budget. These tips will work for any business in any industry. However, they will look different depending on your audience, goals, and the resources at your disposal. With that said, let’s take a look at how you can build a robust SEO strategy without investing a lot of money! 1. Focus on Long-tail Keywords Your customers want answers to their questions, and they want to find the best deal without wasting time. This is why your business needs to focus on user intent when building your SEO strategy. One aspect of this type of strategy for a business with a limited SEO budget is to use long-tail keywords instead of general keywords. Long-tail keywords are key phrases that are very specific to the needs of your customers. These types of phrases are longer and more accurate than their more commonly searched variations. Unlike standard keywords, long-tail keywords offer your SEO strategy several benefits, including: Particular user-intent focus, content production, and publication. Lower competition compared to general keyword variations. Due to their specificity, long-tail keywords are highly focused and relevant to online searches. Long-tail keywords drive higher conversions because they deliver highly qualified traffic and leads through online searches. Even though long-tail keywords will have much lower traffic compared to generic keyword terms, if you are working on a small SEO budget then you need to focus on user intent and conversions. It is far easier (and cheaper) to rank for specific keywords that are highly relevant to your audience than to rank for general terms that your large corporate competition is bidding on. The reason that long-tail keywords work so well for budget-conscious businesses is that Google continues to advance their algorithm to favor content that is relevant to specific search queries. Gone are the days of sprinkling generic keywords in your content and achieving great online rankings. Google’s business model depends on high-quality third-party data and relevant information for their users. The first step of a great budget-conscious SEO strategy is to focus on the needs of your customers and produce content with long-tail keywords. 2. Publish Quality Guest Blog Posts Guest blogging is a powerful way to strengthen your SEO strategy because it allows you to share your knowledge with a new audience and helps you generate backlinks. There has been a lot of debate on whether guest blogging is still valuable. As long as you don’t spam garbage content on sites with low authority, then there is no reason to think that guest blogging is not a valuable SEO strategy for a business with a limited budget. Guest blogging is an inexpensive method to build backlinks, establish great relationships, and share your knowledge with a new audience. While guest blogging is a proven strategy to build your online ranking on a budget, it will require a significant amount of time to perform necessary tasks, including: Research your industry to find relevant sites that accept guest blog posts. Produce amazing content tailored to the readers of that website. Reach out to blog editors to build rapport and publish your excellent content. Follow up and continue your relationship — most websites don’t let you do one-off blog posts. You should approach guest blogging with the objective to provide value to your readers. When done correctly, your online ranking will increase because search engines will show that your business is an authority in your industry. 3. Local Optimization So you want to rank nationally on the cheap, huh? Well, let me be the first to tell you that it takes a lot of time, money, and energy to rank nationally for competitive keywords. Companies have been working for years and spent millions of dollars to achieve a high ranking for keywords. You won’t be able to reach high rankings for general, highly competitive keywords if you don’t have a lot of money to invest. Instead of looking for widespread attention, you would be better off to focus your limited budget in your local or regional market. Dominating your domestic market will provide the highest ROI and quickest growth opportunity compared to spreading your attention across a larger geographic area. Local SEO is the answer for your business if you are trying to build a strong online presence on a relatively small SEO budget. Here are three local SEO strategies you can use to dominate your local market and skyrocket your online rankings. Set up Google My Business and Local SEO Accounts If you don’t have a Google My Business account yet, stop what you are doing (after you read this article) and go set one up. Google My Business is the directory that Google uses to show local businesses based on the search done by an online user. Along with getting in front of your audience, Google My Business will also boost your local SEO efforts by: Displaying your business on Google search results, Google Maps, and Google Plus. Setting up multiple locations. If your business has different locations in a region then you can differentiate between the locations. Upload videos and pictures. These are crucial if you want to overcome early objections and have a high-quality first impression. Highlight reviews from past customers. This is a great way to drive sales with social proof. Google My Business can help you build a loyal fan base and provides quick info about your business like directions, phone number, and hours of operation. Those are just a few of the benefits your business will see with Google My Business. If nothing else, your business will drive conversions with a local SEO strategy with this great (and free) optimization tool. Once you set up and optimize your Google My Business account, you will have premium exposure in Google search results, and this exposure provides your audience direct access to your business. Even if your business does not have a brick-and-mortar store, you should still set up this service to gain all the benefits and qualified traffic. To take your local SEO strategy one step further, you should also consider creating a business account with various local business directories. Some of the local directories I have seen great results from include: Bing Places Better Business Bureau Merchant Circle Thumbtack Google My Business will position your company high in search results and local directories usually provide a no-follow backlink that can help your online ranking. Generate Local Reviews Customer reviews are the backbone of your local SEO strategy. Not only are these reviews essential for a low-budget SEO strategy, but they are also an easy way to improve your online presence. Local reviews serve as a form of social proof, and they are quickly becoming the digital version of word-of-mouth marketing. Testimonials also help remove the nervousness of your potential customers from purchasing from you, especially if you offer a relatively unknown product or service because they: Show that your business is trustworthy and community members use and love your services. Help you build a positive reputation. This will help you build authority, especially if you are new to the market. Increase exposure in online searches. Google Local uses reviews to understand your business and displays the reviews in local search results. If you are operating on a limited SEO budget, then you should focus your marketing efforts and resources on your local community. You can run a simple campaign by asking your customers to provide a review on the spot, include an invitation on your receipts, and run marketing campaigns to get people to give testimonials on your website or online listings. Get Involved With Local Networking & Meetups Since a local SEO strategy is the best use of funds for a budget-conscious business (see above points), you should continue to build your authority in your local market by networking. If you are a new business, then you need to increase brand awareness, and you can accomplish this with local networking and building connections. While this strategy takes a significant amount of time, you can also host a meetup or present at local events to reach new customers or build new partnerships in the community. Forming partnerships with other local businesses can help you generate great content and build a great backlink profile. These elements will help your SEO strategy for almost no monetary investment. For example, if you are a wedding photographer, you can partner with a local wedding decor store to create a content series to talk about wedding-related issues. This partnership means that your business gains access to the audience of other companies and this helps generate valuable content for your audience. You can also use these connections to form partnerships to improve your content marketing strategy, and help you build online connections to improve your backlink profile (see previous points). Ballin’ on a Budget-friendly SEO Strategy The great thing about SEO is that the best practices are constantly changing. This means you can build a robust SEO strategy even if you lack the big marketing budget of your competition. The only caveat is that you will need to invest time and creativity to improve how you rank online. Just remember to focus your limited time, money, and resources on highly-focused content through long-tail keywords, optimize your business for local SEO, and publish excellent content through guest blogging to hit your business! Use these tips to reach your audience and drive online sales without a deep marketing budget! Image Credits Featured Image: Pixabay Screenshots by Chris Giarratana. Taken February 2017.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google testing out visual search for mobile and other image features By Ida Torres - March 6, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter While you can do reverse image search on your desktop browser, we would of course like a properly working mobile image search. While it is not officially available yet, it seems that Google is testing out a new feature that would let you search the web not with words but with an image. They will also be bringing other image features soon on the Google app, but all these aren’t yet available even on the recently released beta version, but may be in the A/B testing phase. You can actually search with images from your mobile device through the Screen search feature, previously available on Google Now on Tap and also with Google Assistant for those whose devices are compatible. But the process wasn’t that easy so there is a need for a dedicated app or even a special section in the Google app. It seems they’re testing out for the upcoming version 6.14 an image search feature found within the Google app’s navigation menu. When you tap Visual Search section from the menu, it will launch a new interface that has a camera view and a bottom bar to instruct you to tap on any part of the image that you want to search. You will then see a carousel of search suggestions using a card-like format with a cover image. When you tap on it, you will see the full search results. Aside from this, the save section will also be added to the navigation menu and here you will find tabs for Saved Items and Tags as well. However, unless you’re part of the A/B testing group, you won’t be able to see this feature yet.

In the interaction with Gizmodo India, Osterloh highlighted the importance of user experience and said that Google would go to any length to develop components, which would offer its Pixel smartphones an edge in terms of user experience. "We will go anywhere where innovation requires us to go," he said. "Without a doubt, the company will make bold and audacious bets on technology if they impact the user experience," he added. He cited the example of TPUs which Google has developed for its data centres, however, he did say that Google wasn't specifically developing custom silicon for the Pixel smartphones. While Google had taken that direction for its TPUs to run tensor flow in its data centres, Osterloh said if that kind of an approach was needed for its consumer electronics division, Google would do it. Famously, Apple designs its own ARM processors for the iPhone and the iPad which has been a reason for the perceived superior user experience of iOS devices. Not designing chips, co-developing with supply partners But currently he indicated that kind of an approach wasn't needed as Google wasn't "just" sourcing "off the shelf" components like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and marrying it to its software. He said that many elements in the supply chain are actually co-developed by OEMs and the supply partner. "Well, off the shelf is a funny term. What you really do is that you work very closely with every supply partner who has a critical piece in your user experience and you co-design elements of the component. We certainly expect to continue doing that with all of our partners," he said. This was on expected lines as component makers like Qualcomm and Sony which are the lead players in smartphone silicon and camera modules largely sell their products to companies that make devices based on Google's Android platform. Additionally, for certain use cases, these supply chain partners develop features in tandem with their OEM partners. For instance, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 was the first fully VR ready mobile processor and it debuted with the Pixel and the Android Daydream View headset which was for Google's VR platform. Why Pixel and Google Home? Osterloh explained that Google wanted to offer products that best represented what the Google brand stood for and that's why it got into the hardware game. Google's philosophy behind Android allows its partners to modify Android in a way they could showcase their own brand. But this also means that Google's name doesn't come out properly and at times the modifications don't represent Google's brand. Pixel 2 coming later this year At the briefing Osterloh also addressed the elephant in the room. The successor to the Pixel and he said that a successor was in the works which would come later in the year without divulging much information. "There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it. You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now," he said. He further specified that the Pixel line would remain a premium offering, and Google would work with their OEM partners for cheaper Android alternatives squashing any report of a budget Pixel branded smartphone. Disclaimer: Qualcomm paid for the journalist's travel and stay in Barcelona to cover Mobile World Congress.

Google tells retailers the Trusted Stores program is shutting down The new program, Google Customer Reviews, will be managed from Google Merchant Center. Ginny Marvin on March 6, 2017 at 9:21 am More Google began notifying Google Trusted Stores merchants last week that the program will soon wind down. In its place will be Google Customer Reviews. The change was first reported by Exclusive Concepts. Google Customer Reviews Like Google Trusted Stores, the new program is also free, but it is not a certification program. Google Customer Reviews collects reviews on behalf of advertisers from customers after they purchase and receive their orders. Google Customer Reviews will be managed through Google Merchant Center. When it becomes widely available, according to an update to the help center, merchants who aren’t in Google Trusted Stores already will find it listed as an option in Merchant Center programs from the three-dot navigation icon in the upper right corner of Merchant Center. Google Trusted Stores merchants will have their accounts migrated automatically and see Customer Reviews listed in the left-hand navigation in their Merchant Center accounts. If approved, new merchants will need to add the survey opt-in module to their websites. When consumers opt in after making a purchase, Google contacts them to rate their purchases once they’ve received their orders. Merchants must display the opt-in to all customers in order to be compliant with the program. Merchants can display a Google Customer Reviews website badge on their websites. The image can be customized and can show the merchants’ star rating if Seller Ratings are available. A look back at Google Trusted Stores Like Google Customer Ratings, Google Trusted Stores gave merchants the ability to gather reviews for Seller Ratings. The certification and ratings program launched in beta in 2011 and rolled out to all US merchants in 2012. Ratings information provided to consumers from the Google Trusted Stores badge Qualified merchants could display the Trusted Stores badge on their sites and offer customers up to $1,000 in purchase protection backed by Google. The program integrated with AdWords in 2013. That integration has enabled Trusted Stores to show seller ratings stars in search ads, display the Google Trusted Stores logo next to the merchant name in shopping ads and reference Google Trusted Store status in review extensions. Google Trusted Stores logo displays in shopping ads Trusted Stores participation has always been free, though until late 2014/early 2015, merchants had to provide shipping and order cancellation data directly to Google. Those requirements made many retailers balk for both privacy reasons and reluctance to share such data with the internet giant. With the data requirements dropped, merchants still had to meet a minimum of 200 orders on average per month and acknowledge that they could meet baseline customer-support functions such as responding to inquiries within one business day. Google has relied on Consumer Surveys to collect ratings information on retailer attributes like shipping, product selection and pricing. That data currently powers the data provided in AdWords Customer Ratings Extensions. Google also has a partnership with StellaService for customer service ratings information and sources reviews from a number of online ratings services like BazaarVoice and TrustPilot. More details to come Google says it will be sharing more details on Google Customer Reviews in the next few weeks. For now, it has told Trusted Stores participants that under the new program, merchants will be able to manage their reviews in Google Merchant Center, gain new insights into their seller ratings and have more ways to customize the Google badge and opt-in form on their sites. The consumer protection offered in Google Trusted Stores does not appear to be part of this new program, but we cannot confirm that at this time. It’s also not clear if monthly order minimums will be changing for eligibility or how participation will manifest in search ads apart from Seller Ratings. Most existing Google Trusted Stores accounts will be migrated automatically into Google Merchant Center. Program administrations will have been notified via email if steps need to be taken ahead of the migration.

Google has announced that its note keeping service will now be fully integrated with Google Docs, letting you swap your notes to G Suite with ease. With the new introduction, users can easily access their notes from Keep and insert them to G Suite. Initially, the service will be available only with Google Docs. To get the notes, users will have to select keep from the Toole menu inside Google Docs, which will bring forward a new Keep panel.   This side panel will present you with the notes from Keep, and those can be inserted to the docs by simply dragging and placing them over doc, preserving images and formatting. The keep panel is also provided with a search option to easily access the notes that aren’t highlighted in the Keep panel. Apart from that, users will also be able to add new notes from Doc through the ‘Save to Keep notepad’ option made available in the right-click menu after selecting the desired text. The links to the original doc will be provided in the saved notes as well, which is a real plus of the Keep integration with G Suite. As of now, Google hasn’t revealed whether or when the Keep services will be made available to rest of the G Suite apps and smartphone applications. Until then, users can make use of it in Docs, which apparently is where Keep note integration makes the most sense.

Image: Mark Stedman Beats Medical’s Ciara Clancy has been awarded the accolade of Ireland’s best young entrepreneur at a Google event. Ciara Clancy, the woman behind Beats Medical, has added to her mass collection of accolades with the title of Ireland’s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE). Receiving her latest award at Google HQ, Clancy, a physiotherapist, was lauded for the app that is transforming the lives of thousands of people with Parkinson’s disease all over the world. There were 1,800 entrants aged between 18-35, and it was Clancy’s revolutionary app that earned her a €45,000 investment fund through the Local Enterprise Offices. Beats Medical has exploded onto the scene in the past couple of years. Utilising individualised metronome therapy, the app improves mobility and reduces instances of gait freezing. It also provides users with daily assessments and regular progress reports. “These success stories keep all of the team at Beats Medical motivated every day to do more for the people that use our service,” said Clancy, who hinted at a future business plan whereby similar apps are used to treat other illnesses, such as MS, stroke, dyspraxia and cerebral palsy. “I want to congratulate and say a hearty ‘well done’ to Ciara Clancy of Beats Medical in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown on winning this year’s IBYE title,” said Mary Mitchell O’Connor, Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, TD. “It is a superb achievement,” she said. “That said, all of our finalists here today are winners, having taken their ideas and concepts through a tough and rigorous process to make them market-ready. “Seeing their projects come to fruition is enormously gratifying and is testament to the huge effort they have invested.” In 2015, Clancy was named Laureate for Europe at the Cartier Women’s Initiative Awards, and Beats Medical also beat off the competition in Google’s Adopt a Startup programme. Late last year, Beats Medical became the first Irish company to present at Google’s demo day. Meanwhile, Alvan Hunt of Hexafly won in the best business idea category, while the winner of the best start-up business was Samuel Dennigan. Hexafly uses cutting-edge biotechnology to find smart ways to feed the planet using the by-products of insects, while Strong Roots is providing new healthy alternatives in the frozen food sector.

File photo: Eric Risberg / AP San Francisco - When Uber Technologies was raising venture capital in 2013, it was one of the hottest deals around – and no one was more eager to write a check than Bill Maris and David Krane of Google's venture capital arm. Not everyone at Google Ventures, since renamed GV, agreed. The firm already had an investment in a competitor, Sidecar, and Uber was demanding what then looked like a sky-high valuation. Maris and Krane prevailed, and the deal is now regarded as GV’s greatest success. On paper, the firm's initial 2013 investment of $258 million gained about 14 times its value over the next three years to more than $3.5 billion. But now Alphabet Inc, Google's corporate parent, is suing Uber for theft of trade secrets, alleging that one of the top engineers in its self-driving car program decamped with thousands of confidential files, including designs that helped him start self-driving truck company Otto and then quickly sell it to Uber. Uber denies those claims. The lawsuit, filed by Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, has jolted the fast-growing and highly competitive industry that has sprung up around autonomous vehicles and ride services, which are seen as the future of private road transport. Yet the confrontation was a long time in the making: the complex relationship between the companies was tense from the start, according to people familiar with the situation, and soured further as they increasingly competed with each other. Now, if the Waymo suit damages Uber, GV's investment in the ride-hailing company stands to go down as a Silicon Valley rarity: a large funding deal undermined by the firm's own investors. “Whatever Waymo gains, Google Ventures loses,” said Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University. The lawsuit is just one in a series of recent public setbacks for Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment that prompted an internal investigation, a video of Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that led him to make a public apology, and Uber's admission on Friday that it used a secret tracking tool to avoid authorities. “We have reviewed Waymo's claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court," Uber said in a statement in response to the lawsuit. "In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.” A spokeswoman for GV declined to comment. At any cost Uber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map. Maris and Krane were early Uber fans, but it took about two years for the pair to connect with Kalanick. When Uber investor Benchmark finally brokered a meeting in May 2013, the Google Ventures partners were determined to do a deal at virtually any cost, according to two sources close to the transaction. With other would-be investors waiting in adjacent conference rooms at Uber’s San Francisco offices, Maris and Krane made their pitch to invest. Kalanick pushed for a higher valuation, without a board seat; Google Ventures pushed back, asking for a board observer seat and a liquidation preference for protection if Uber was sold at a loss, one of the sources said. They finally came to terms, with a $3.5 billion valuation, and there were signs that a broader alliance could be in the offing. Separately, David Drummond, Google's senior vice president of corporate development, had a social relationship with Kalanick, and he joined the board. A ride in a self-driving car and a meeting with Google CEO Larry Page, recounted in Brad Stone's recent book "The Upstarts," seemed to bode well for the relationship. But conflicts emerged immediately. Kalanick, a tough negotiator, wanted a discount on the software tools behind Google Maps, the company's ubiquitous mapping software, according to a person close to the transaction. The best Google Ventures could offer was close contact between Uber and Google’s mapping team, the person said. Kalanick also wanted Uber to be featured prominently in Google Maps, eventually giving customers a way to hail an Uber ride directly from Maps, and Google agreed, a source close to Uber said. But Uber felt Google dragged its heels on the integration and found the initial rollout disappointing, the source said.

Uber announced its intentions in typically abrupt style in early 2015, poaching 40 faculty and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to set up a self-driving lab in Pennsylvania. It bought mapping software firm deCarta and began investing heavily in its own mapping systems. Meanwhile, Google launched an on-demand delivery service, a market Uber is also chasing, and began offering a carpooling service through driving app Waze, which it acquired in 2013. The carpooling feature in particular rankled Uber, a source close to the company said. "Things escalated from frenemy to now enemy quite quickly," said Anand Sanwal, CEO and co-founder of venture capital research firm CB Insights. The tension bubbled to the surface last August, when Drummond stepped down from Uber’s board. Uber declined comment on any of its dealings with Google and did not make Kalanick available for an interview. Undermined Uber’s aggressive culture was the subject of many conversations at Google Ventures, a source close to the transaction said. Hoping to influence the startup, the venture firm at first encouraged a flow of talent from Google to Uber. Yet that too ultimately created problems. Anthony Levandowski, a key engineering manager at the self-driving car unit, now called Waymo, began to talk openly about leaving the company as the autonomous vehicle field blossomed, according to Alphabet's lawsuit. In January 2016, Levandowski and some colleagues quit Alphabet to form the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired later that year for $680 million. Alphabet claims in its lawsuit that Levandowski had been in touch with Uber even before he left Alphabet. In the lawsuit, Alphabet alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 proprietary design documents and used them to create Otto's - and later Uber's - version of a key autonomous vehicle technology called Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position. Uber and Levandowski deny the allegations. Read also: Uber relies on stolen tech The high-stakes legal showdown over whether vital information was transferred between the two companies is perhaps the logical conclusion of their opaque relationship. All along, Uber remained mysterious to its Google Ventures investors. Kalanick was adamant from the start that he would share little information, and try as it might, Google Ventures could not gain better visibility over time, two sources said. If anything, Kalanick grew more tight-lipped as his business matured. “It was one of the few companies where we sat there and said, 'Hope it goes well,'" one of the sources said.

Russian search company Yandex filed a complaint with the board in 2015, alleging that Google requires smartphone manufacturers to pre-load Google Play Store, Google Play Services and Google Mobile Services on any Android devices they sell, and to make Google Search the default search provider on those devices. Such behavior would be a concern for Yandex, which offers app store, mobile mapping and search services of its own. Yandex had filed similar complaints against Google elsewhere too, including in Russia and the European Union, while a similar case in the U.S. was triggered by other complainants. The Turkish complaint fizzled in December 2015, when the competition regulator ruled that there was no need for an inquiry since smartphone buyers were free to download other applications to the devices they purchased. However, the regulator also decided to ask Google to remove the exclusive preloading conditions from its agreements with phone manufacturers, so that market forces could determine which apps were installed. Unhappy with the ruling, Yandex appealed to the Ankara District Administrative Court, which in October 2016 suspended the board's initial ruling. On Monday, however, the board decided to launch an investigation into the business practices of Google, Google International, and its Turkish advertising and marketing subsidiary Google Reklamcılık ve Pazarlama. The investigation will examine whether the companies broke Turkish laws prohibiting anticompetitive agreements, cartels and abuses of dominant positions, the board said Monday. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

That’s because Alphabet’s Google GOOGL, -0.21%  has long dominated both internet searches and related ad spending. In fact, most search advertisers spend the vast majority of their budgets with Google, perhaps sprinkle in a bit of Microsoft’s MSFT, +0.03%  Bing, and call it day. But that could be changing, thanks to Amazon AMZN, -0.38%  and perhaps Pinterest. That’s welcome news for search advertisers, who hope for more options for clients, as well as better products and pricing that could be spurred by more competition. To date, “there hasn’t been a tremendous amount of innovation in search,” said Scott Shamberg, U.S. president of Performics, a direct response-focused division of Publicis Media. For years, there hasn’t been much fluidity in terms of user behavior. Google commanded roughly 64% of desktop searches in December, according to comScore, followed by 23% for Microsoft’s Bing—rankings that have hardly budged in years. Google recorded over 12 billion desktop searches in January, versus less than one billion on Amazon. The domination in behavior also translates to advertising. Google is expected to pull in 76% of the search ad spending in the U.S. this year, versus about 8.3% for Microsoft and less than 1% for Amazon, says eMarketer.

In any event, we've covered him a lot here despite him being pretty quiet and a low-key person. On March 4, 2017 he posted on Twitter that he is celebrating his 15th year at Google. Look at all those Os in the Google logo for him on this day... He joined Google in 2002, a couple years before the Google IPO. He joined two years after Matt Cutts and Amit Signhal. But he is still pretty up there in terms of the algorithm at Google. I hope he sticks around at Google for some time but it seems like all the old timers are leaving these days. The photo above is from an SMX conference where he was surrounded by SEOs after his talk. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Created by Google in partnership with Australian Marriage Equality, the campaign visualises survey results and YouTube Polls collected from thousands of consumers across Australia’s states and territories. The survey asked people whether they are in love, how they feel about public displays of affection, their personal experiences with love and whether they think marriage equality is fair. The Interactive Map reveals data collected by Google and Youtube polls. Consumers can follow different coloured pens on the map as they draw images like a human heart, a dartboard and a birthday cake to represents the findings. Tara McKenty, creative director at Google Australia, said: “We’re a data-driven company. So we set out to see if we could quantify the unquantifiable, and we polled the nation on love: We asked who’s in love. We asked them how strongly they’re in love, we showed people photos of other people in love and asked if they could spot love when it was right in front of them.” The map, which draws a human heart in rainbow, reveals insights such as 45% of Australians are currently in love, 85% think holding hands in fine and 63% think it is fair to make same-sex marriage legal. One of the maps images shows how Australians feel about public displays of affection. Renee LaBriola, leader of Google Australia’s ‘Gayglers’ employee group, said the company was “committed to cultivating a work environments where Googlers can be themselves and thrive.” “We also want our employees to have the same inclusive experience outside of the office, and for LGBTQI communities to be safe and to be accepted wherever they are.” Executive director of The Equality Campaign, Tiernan Brady, said the values of fairness and respect need to continue to underpin marriage equality conversations. The campaign comes following Google’s announcement of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras grant recipients including Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia, Selamat Datang, People with Disability Australia, Lifesavers with Pride, Trans Sydney with Pride, Northern Territory AIDS and Hepatitis Council & Departure Lounge, Psychedelic Love, Sydney Women’s AFL, The Gay and Lesbian Association of Doctors and Dentists, Wett Ones Sydney Swim Team, Inner City Legal Centre, DAYENU, Gay Tradies, Oceania Rainbow, Flourish Australia and Different Strokes Dragon Boat Club. Google’s Love By Numbers Data is hosted online by The Equality campaign. Zoe Samios Zoe Samios is a reporter at Mumbrella mainly covering creative agencies.

But, as with all good things, it hasn’t lasted. And now the tech giant is at the centre of a fake news storm as its newest hardware, Google Home, has been caught recalling a fairly suspect news source when asked a question about President Barack Obama. And here's what happens if you ask Google Home "is Obama planning a coup?" pic.twitter.com/MzmZqGOOal— Rory Cellan-Jones (@ruskin147) March 5, 2017 In a video shared on Twitter by the BBC’s Rory Cellan-Jones, when asked if Obama is planning a coup, the speaker responds: “According to Secrets Of The Fed. According to details exposed in Western Center for Journalism’s exclusive video, not only could Obama be in bed with the communist Chinese, but Obama may in fact be planning a communist coup d’etat at the end of his term in 2016.” While we can’t claim to know the inner workings of Obama’s secret circles, as anyone who has lived through Trump’s inauguration will testify, the end of Obama’s term in the White House did not in fact end with a Communist coup. Meaning that the answer provided by Google Home is at best factually incorrect, and at worst, pretty damn terrifying. Google Home sources its information via Google Assistant, meaning it is referring back to Google itself when you ask it a question. A feature that is meant to set it above rival Amazon Echo, but it seems having instant access to unchecked results isn’t perhaps all it is cracked up to be.   If you're wondering if Obama is planning a coup, Google's "one true answer" is yes. FFS. pic.twitter.com/pFr7omJttU— Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) March 5, 2017 This Google Snippet is where the Home speaker would have sourced the information from when answering the Obama question, as seen here from a screenshot on 5 March. Since the accusations have become public, the search engine now does not pull this snippet because news stories have pushed its ranking on to the second page.  Google Page 1 But the ‘Secrets Of The Fed’ article, referred to by Google Home, is still there on the second page. Google Page 2 Not only that, but due to the way Google Home is collecting answers from the search rankings, it could easily feature fake news again, if the news is ranking highly enough. According to Yahoo, the device has also been reporting that five former Presidents of the USA were members of the KKK, and that Obama is ‘king of the United States’ as this information appears in this Breitbart article from 2014.

Google Reportedly Working on Budget Phone Without Pixel Branding GO Google is currently developing a prototype of a budget phone Mar 6, 2017 13:23 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Last week, we reported that Google already started working on a Pixel successor, as Google’s head of hardware department, Rick Osterloh, stated. The Pixel 2 phone would stay in the premium range of smartphones, in a market segment that Google entered last year with the launch of Pixel and Pixel XL. The Pixel 2 phone is expected to arrive later this year, possibly in October. The phone will pack the latest technology and powerful components so that it could take on other premium phones on the market, including the Galaxy S8 and Apple’s offerings for this year. Stock Android is also expected and perhaps Google will take into consideration suggestions from users and provide the new Pixel smartphone with protection against water and dust damages. We didn’t expect a budget Pixel phone, but recent reports have stated the contrary. Budget Google phone might be released this year Google might be working on a budget smartphone, but it won’t necessarily carry the Pixel branding. While the project is being conducted by the Pixel team, the phone could be a Google-built Android One device aimed at emerging markets with lots of potential. Sadly, the smartphone won’t be sold in the United States. Reportedly, the budget phone is developed alongside the Pixel 2 premium device, but there’s no guarantee that it will pass the prototype phase and actually make it to the market. Details on the subject are very murky for now, so take this information with a grain of salt. Perhaps Google wishes consumers to associate the Pixel branding with the premium range of smartphones, which is why the budget phone won’t be a Pixel. The next Pixel smartphone is said to arrive in October, but Google’s official didn’t disclose the launch date. Presumably, the phone will arrive at the start of the month and Google will host an event similar to the one it organized last year. #Google#Pixel#Pixel 2#Budget phone#Waterproof subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Assistant Could Soon Arrive on Apple's iPhone Google Assistant Starts Arriving on Eligible Nougat and Marshmallow Devices Google to Launch Pixel 2 Smartphone This Fall, It Will Stay in the Premium Range Meet the General Mobile GM6, the Newest Android One Smartphone Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Android Pay Now Available in Belgium After Samsung Pay Expanded to India Italy Blocks RARBG, Flashx, Other Torrent Sites Microsoft Brings Outlook on Apple’s MacBook Touch Bar Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge    Google Pixel XL New Android APKs Lyft APK: Updated March 7th, 09:30 GMT OverDrive APK: Updated March 7th, 09:23 GMT Boxcryptor APK: Updated March 7th, 09:19 GMT Happify APK: Updated March 7th, 09:15 GMT SecondScreen APK: Updated March 7th, 08:29 GMT NHL APK: Updated March 7th, 08:14 GMT Wire APK: Updated March 7th, 08:12 GMT Reader comments Samsung Reportedly Pushed Back the Galaxy S8 Release to April 28 more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

In a statement on its website, the authority said the probe aimed to determine whether Google’s contracts with equipment producers, in addition to its mobile communications systems, applications, and provision of services, had violated the law. The competition authority had previously concluded that opening an investigation into the company was not necessary, but decided to change its decision after a second evaluation.

He also met the FC Barcelona team and saw the rich history of the club in its museums. The recent Mobile World Congress held in Barcelona saw a host of Tech experts from around the globe attend the event. Topping the list was Google’s Indian born CEO Sundar Pichai. Pichai was there along with his team from Google to attend the event. Apart from the MWC 2017, the Google CEO took a visit to the La Masia, the mecca of FC Barcelona, responsible for creating players like Lionel Messi, Xavi, Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Pique and many more. On his visit there, the Google CEO was shown around by the current president of FC Barcelona, Josep Maria Bartomeu. He also met the FC Barcelona team and saw the rich history of the club in its museums and trophy collection. Here are some pictures of Sundar Pichai’s trip to FC Barcelona: Sundar Pichai meets Luis Suarez. Suarez thinks Pichai is a Real Madrid fan, FC Barcelona’s biggest rival. His doubt is cleared when Bartomeu confirms that Pichai is a long time FC Barcelona fan. Google CEO meets Luis Suarez. (Image: Facebook/ FC Barcelona) Pichai meets Ter Stegen, the goalkeeper of FC Barcelona. He complimented Ter Stegen on his performance in the last game against Atletico Madrid.

Judging from the smile that he carries throughout the visit, it was definitely a fan moment for the Google CEO. He even got an FC Barcelona team jersey for ‘Google’ towards the end of the visit. While leaving, he tells Bartomeu that he would visit again and to keep Messi in the team. Pichai was gifted a team jersey for 'Google'. (Image: Facebook/ FC Barcelona) FC Barcelona Google.

About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Menu About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Search advertisement Homepage » Connectivity » Google launches classifieds website in Kenya Google launches classifieds website in Kenya Posted 17 Oct 2011 by Staff Writer (@techzim) Read 7 Comments Today, Google announced that it has launched Google Trader, a classifieds service, in Kenya. Here’s the address: google.co.ke/africa/trader. According to a post on the Google Africa blog, thousands of businesses have already posted tens of thousands of classifieds listings on the site and the content is growing. The Google Trader service is not new in Africa. It’s been launched already in Ghana and Uganda. It was launched in June 2009 in Uganda as an SMS based classifieds service and later extended to the web the same year. Google announced that year that “most mobile devices in Africa only have voice and SMS capabilities, and so we are focusing our technological efforts in that continent on SMS” Google doesn’t say today if the Kenya implementation will have the SMS version of the service that both Google Trader Uganda and Ghana have. From what we observe, likely not. The Kenya website doesn’t have the SMS instructions that are clearly visible on the Ghana and Uganda sites. We’ll try to find out why. In Kenya, Google will compete with other online classifieds services like n-soko and Dealfish. n-soko is owned by Nation Media Group, publishers of the Daily Nation, a publication considered Kenya’s most influential newspaper. advertisement share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: classifieds, Google, Google Trader, Kenya Previous Post « I’m investing in Zim Agriculture, says African award winning telecoms exec Next post Copied work: The Econet Broadband ad campaign » 7 Comments JamesM says: October 17, 2011 at 8:48 PM Classifieds seems to be the route most budding Zim tech entrepreneurs have taken. It’s one which no longer appeals to me and one I caution local tech entrepreneurs from jumping into unless one has a really compelling product. Not that it’s a bad business model but one that has attracted lots of players including the almighty Google itself. Good luck competing with Google!

No sooner have you spied the latest handset, then there's anticipation of something else, the next big thing. We've rounded up the best smartphones for 2017, those we consider to be the best across all platforms, and we've regularly updated that list as the smartphone world has evolved. You can find those in our Best smartphones 2017: The best phones available to buy today feature. If your budget is a little smaller, there is also our Best budget smartphones 2017: The best phones available to buy for under £250. Here we're looking at those phones that haven't yet launched, the best upcoming phones for 2017. We'll be updating this list on a regular basis, with those device rumours we think are credible and exciting, and devices just announced but yet to hit the shelves. We've also just had a glut of new smartphones at MWC 2017. Mobile World Congress 2017: All the announcements that matter Best upcoming phones 2017 Before we dive into the detail, here are some of the anticipated upcoming handsets for 2017: Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus HTC U/HTC Ocean Apple iPhone 8 Apple iPhone 8 Plus OnePlus 5 Google Pixel 2 @evleaks Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus Samsung had sure-fire hits with the Galaxy S7, especially in the S7 edge model. The company's standing in mobile might suffer a little following the Note 7's battery problems, so the Galaxy S8 might have to be extra special. Rumours have suggested that Samsung might drop the flat version of the S8, only offering curved devices in two sizes. There's also talk of increasing the screen resolution, perhaps with a move to 4K, and talk of 5.8 and 6.1-inch sizes, but with those big screens packed into more compact bodies. Samsung is sure to pack the S8 with its latest Exynos 8895 chipset for oodles of power, although we'd expect a Snapdragon 835 version too, and we'd expect to see a move to USB Type-C, following the move of the Note 7. On the software front, we'd expect the S8 to launch on Android Nougat with TouchWiz. Given Samsung's great experience, we'd not expect too many changes to Samsung's software experience. As the Samsung Galaxy S8 release date, it will be announced on 29 March 2017. Samsung Galaxy S8: Release date, rumours and everything you need to know Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus: Everything you need to know @evleaks HTC Ocean HTC's next flagship handset is thought to be going under the name of HTC Ocean. This name came from a video leak which showed off a concept handset, but supported by a leak via Twitter. HTC launched its first handsets for 2017 in the form of the U Play and U Ultra, but at the time said this wasn't the flagship and there was more to come. It's early days in the rumour cycle for this handset, but the focus of the video was on new methods of interaction, showing a phone with no buttons and using a mixture of voice, gestures and swipes to control it, so that's what we're expecting - as well as a Snapdragon 835 and a launch date at some point later in the year, perhaps April. One thing we do know for sure is that it won't be called HTC 11. HTC Ocean: What's the story on HTC's next flagship? Pocket-lint Apple iPhone 8 Yes, already. The paint has barely dried on the iPhone 7, but there's already talk of the iPhone 8, which is reported to shake things up completely. The iPhone 7, surprisingly, didn't make a huge change over the iPhone 6S, but the biggest hint at what to expect from the iPhone 8 might have come from Apple Watch. With the release of the Series 2 device, Apple introduced a ceramic version. This, paired with the jet black colouring for the iPhone 7, might point to future changes in materials for the iPhone 8.  Some are suggesting that the iPhone 8 will be mostly glass and introduce wireless charging, but there's expected to be a special edition ceramic version too. Taking it further, it's suggested that there will be an iPhone 7S and 7S Plus too, alongside this roaring iPhone 8. Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: What's the story so far? Pocket-lint OnePlus 5 Wait, what? No, you're not going mad. There's a rumour that OnePlus will be skipping the 4 number and heading straight to OnePlus 5. The OnePlus 5 could land with a glass or ceramic body, moving on from the OnePlus 3T to present something a little different. It wouldn't be the first time that OnePlus has used something different, as it did in the OnePlus X. A 5.3-inch display might meet a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset for loads of power. This could all be heading your way in May or June. OnePlus 4/OnePlus 5: What's the story so far? Pocket-lint Google Pixel 2 The Google Pixel has received great acclaim for it's pure Google phone approach, with a lot of people really loving the camera experience.  Rumours are light on the Google Pixel 2 - we don't even have confirmation of the name - but it has been confirmed that there will be a new Pixel device in 2017. That was confirmed by Rick Osterloh, SVP of hardware at Google, i.e., the chap who will be responsible for it. Other details are light, but Osterloh also confirmed that the Pixel 2 would retain its premium positioning. That's about all we know so far, but you can expect Android O, and potentially another phone manufactured by HTC. We'd expect it to launch about October time, about a year after the original. Google Pixel 2: What do we want to see? Pocket-lint Nokia 8 Nokia made it's play at Mobile World Congress 2017, launching three Android devices. The lead device was the Nokia 6, but notably missing was a true flagship smartphone, colloquially dubbed the Nokia 8.  Originally leaking as the P1, and then finding itself levelled with the name Nokia 8, we're expecting a premium build, with an IP68 rating, a 5.5-inch display with 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. Most of the hardware rumours have said Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, but with plenty of mixed messaging coming from the flagship rumours and those wrapped up in the Nokia 6/5/3, we're going to be watching and waiting to see how the story of Nokia's flagship unfolds. Nokia 8 Android phone: Release date, rumours and specs facebook/designer Microsoft Surface Phone The Surface Phone is something of a Windows phone holy grail. With Nokia then Microsoft Devices producing plenty of Windows Phones, the spectre of the Surface Phone has been hanging around as the idea of the ultimate Windows mobile device. Given the recent sale of virtually all of its phone patents, and announcement that it's no longer focusing on Windows Phone development, the Surface Phone may never see the light of day. It's rumoured that the new premium device will be Surface branded and Intel powered, possibly coming in three different variants. Given the same team behind the Surface Tablets are said to be behind the Surface Phone, you can expect a solid build if it ever does appear. There's also the suggestion that Surface Phone will run a brand new update of Windows 10, aiming to capitalise on the branding and offer the ultimate experience. Launch originally wasn't expected until the latter half of 2016, but this has since shifted to 2017. That's if it appears at all. Microsoft Surface Phone: What's the story so far? Upcoming phones already announced... Pocket-lint LG G6 LG announced the LG G6 at MWC 2017, launching a phone with a 18:9 display. It's taller, narrower and designed to make it easier to use the 5.7-inch phone. It's a premium build, powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset and packing a pair of cameras on the rear, giving you regular and wide angle shots.  The LG G6 is going to be widely available, but there's no word on price or release date. We have used it, so you can read our full preview of this new handset. LG G6 preview: All screen, no frame Pocket-lint Huawei P10 and P10 Plus Huawei announced the P10 and P10 Plus at MWC 2017, delivering an update to the popular P9 handset. One of the visual changes is a range of interesting colours - it's not just black or grey, it's blue and green. There's a 5.1-inch display on the P10, a 5.5-inch display on the P10 Plus, packed into a metal body. The P10 offers Full HD, the P10 Plus makes a jump to Quad HD, with both being powered by the Kirin 960 chipset. There's a pair of Leica cameras on the rear, offering monochrome and colour capture separately, with optical image stabilisation. The Huawei P10 will be available from March 2017, costing around £550 for the smaller model, the larger is expected to be only £50 more. Read our previews for a little more information. Huawei P10 preview: The lean, green photo machine Huawei P10 Plus preview: Premium package, without a price hike Pocket-lint Nokia 6 The Nokia 6 is now a global device, offering a lovely build on mid-range specs. It has an aluminium body, fronted by a lovely 5.5-inch Full HD display. It's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 chipset and offers a 16-megapixel camera on the rear, 8-megapixel on the front. Most attractive, however, is that it's pure Android, with no bloat at all - the only thing Nokia changes is the camera app. The Arte Black special edition (pictured) is only €299, the normal version is €229, meaning this is a serious bargain for Nokia's return to smartphones. There are also Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 handsets, which drop the specs down - the Nokia 6 is our star pick, however. Nokia 6 preview: A solid start for the new Android Nokia Pocket-lint Moto G5 and G5 Plus Motorola, now under the stewardship of Lenovo, pitched out the Moto G5 and G5 Plus at MWC 2017, updating it's affordable Android device. The Moto G5 now offers a metal body on both these devices, with a front fingerprint scanner. The G5 is a 5-inch device, the G5 Plus expands to 5.2-inches; the G5 Plus offers a more advanced camera and is the more powerful handset, with more storage too. That difference is also reflected in the price. The Moto G5 is £169, the Moto G5 Plus is £269. Both devices will be available in March. Moto G5 preview: The best budget phone, now dressed in a full metal jacket Moto G5 Plus preview: A big dose of premium, without the prohibitive price tag Pocket-lint BlackBerry KeyOne BlackBerry is now produced by TCL and the latest device is the BlackBerry KeyOne, formerly known as Mercury. This is a touch and type handset, offering the full glory of Android, with a BlackBerry keyboard on the bottom. This is a solidly-built handset with a premium finish, with a 3:2 display and powered by a mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chipset. There's plenty of innovation here, like the fingerprint scanner in the space bar. Priced at £499, it's not hugely expensive for those looking for that keyboard fix paired with an Android experience. It will be available in April.

Imogen Groome for Metro.co.ukMonday 6 Mar 2017 12:57 pm (Picture: Google) Today’s Google Doodle is another interactive one – this time it’s all about Komodo dragons. Last month, Google released a Valentine’s Day game featuring cute pangolins – today, Google users can enjoy an interactive quiz to test their knowledge of the reptiles. Fighter jets scrambled to intercept flight and escort it to Birmingham airport To mark the 37th anniversary of Indonesia’s Komodo National Park, the quiz has been created to recognise the world’s largest living lizard species. The park was set up in 1980 as a conservation site for the creatures, who have occupied the region for millions of years. Raja the Komodo Dragon at London Zoo in 2008 (Picture: Getty) There are around 5,700 giant lizards inhabiting the volcanic islands found in the centre of the Indonesian archipelago – they exist nowhere else in the world so are of huge interest to evolutionary scientists. The park has expanded to other native wildlife such as the Timoor deer – the main source of food for komodo dragons – and 72 species of birds. For those who want to take the quiz, head to the Google homepage, where you’ll find five questions on the Komodo dragon.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Anticipation regarding the Google Pixel 2 is sky-high, especially after it has been confirmed that a Pixel successor is already in the works. More importantly, the Google Pixel phones have performed great and received immense critical acclaim. In the meantime, this year is going to see some pretty great smartphones get released, and that includes the Samsung Galaxy S8. Naturally, the Galaxy S8 will be compared a lot with Google Pixel 2. Google’s Senior Vice President of hardware Rick Osterloh said at MWC 2017 that the successor will be released this year, even though a date hasn’t yet been finalised. Rumours are running rampant as both the smartphones, Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy S8, are expected to come with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. The South Korean tech giant will be holding back the heavy-duty processors till the launch of Galaxy S8, which is expected to hit the market sometime in March and April. The Pixel 2 is expected to be released in the latter half of the year, possibly in October. Both the handsets could come in 5-inch and 6-inch models. The Galaxy S8 handset will have an edge-to-edge display. It is not yet known whether the Google Pixel 2 will have a similar display or not. The fingerprint scanner for the Samsung flagship will be embedded in the display, whereas Pixel 2 may go with the existing setup of a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. Camera-wise, there will be intense competition as the Galaxy S8 smartphone could come with dual cameras, a 12MP and a 13MP. The Pixel and Pixel XL have already been highly praised for their camera performance. It will be interesting to see how Google tackles the Samsung flagship with a better camera. Google is reportedly developing a camera lens for the Pixel 2 smartphone that will take brilliant images even in low-light conditions. Both the cameras will be waterproof and dustproof. Regarding the price, the Samsung Galaxy S8 handset is expected to be way more expensive than the Pixel 2. It could have a price tag of US$899 (AU$1,190 approx). The Google Pixel 2 could cost somewhere around US$649 (AU$850 approx). According to Forbes, Google should slim down the huge top and bottom bezels. Moreover, Google should also ensure that there is no supply shortage for the Pixel 2 smartphone. The Pixels were plagued by a supply shortage and many could buy the smartphones when they wanted to. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more information on Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel 2.

Not everyone at Google Ventures, since renamed GV, agreed. The firm already had an investment in a competitor, Sidecar, and Uber was demanding what then looked like a sky-high valuation. Maris and Krane prevailed, and the deal is now regarded as GV´s greatest success. On paper, the firm's initial 2013 investment of $258 million gained about 14 times its value over the next three years to more than $3.5 billion. But now Alphabet Inc, Google's corporate parent, is suing Uber for theft of trade secrets, alleging that one of the top engineers in its self-driving car program decamped with thousands of confidential files, including designs that helped him start self-driving truck company Otto and then quickly sell it to Uber. Uber denies those claims. The lawsuit, filed by Alphabet´s self-driving car unit Waymo, has jolted the fast-growing and highly competitive industry that has sprung up around autonomous vehicles and ride services, which are seen as the future of private road transport. Yet the confrontation was a long time in the making: the complex relationship between the companies was tense from the start, according to people familiar with the situation, and soured further as they increasingly competed with each other. Now, if the Waymo suit damages Uber, GV's investment in the ride-hailing company stands to go down as a Silicon Valley rarity: a large funding deal undermined by the firm's own investors. "Whatever Waymo gains, Google Ventures loses," said Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University. The lawsuit is just one in a series of recent public setbacks for Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment that prompted an internal investigation, a video of Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that led him to make a public apology, and Uber's admission on Friday that it used a secret tracking tool to avoid authorities. "We have reviewed Waymo's claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court," Uber said in a statement in response to the lawsuit. "In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world." A spokeswoman for GV declined to comment. DEAL AT ANY COST Uber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map. Maris and Krane were early Uber fans, but it took about two years for the pair to connect with Kalanick. When Uber investor Benchmark finally brokered a meeting in May 2013, the Google Ventures partners were determined to do a deal at virtually any cost, according to two sources close to the transaction. With other would-be investors waiting in adjacent conference rooms at Uber´s San Francisco offices, Maris and Krane made their pitch to invest. Kalanick pushed for a higher valuation, without a board seat; Google Ventures pushed back, asking for a board observer seat and a liquidation preference for protection if Uber was sold at a loss, one of the sources said. They finally came to terms, with a $3.5 billion valuation, and there were signs that a broader alliance could be in the offing. Separately, David Drummond, Google's senior vice president of corporate development, had a social relationship with Kalanick, and he joined the board. A ride in a self-driving car and a meeting with Google CEO Larry Page, recounted in Brad Stone's recent book "The Upstarts," seemed to bode well for the relationship. But conflicts emerged immediately. Kalanick, a tough negotiator, wanted a discount on the software tools behind Google Maps, the company's ubiquitous mapping software, according to a person close to the transaction. The best Google Ventures could offer was close contact between Uber and Google´s mapping team, the person said. Kalanick also wanted Uber to be featured prominently in Google Maps, eventually giving customers a way to hail an Uber ride directly from Maps, and Google agreed, a source close to Uber said. But Uber felt Google dragged its heels on the integration and found the initial rollout disappointing, the source said. The friction only grew as Uber turned its attention to autonomous driving, an area where Google had already established an early lead. Uber announced its intentions in typically abrupt style in early 2015, poaching 40 faculty and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to set up a self-driving lab in Pennsylvania. It bought mapping software firm deCarta and began investing heavily in its own mapping systems. Meanwhile, Google launched an on-demand delivery service, a market Uber is also chasing, and began offering a carpooling service through driving app Waze, which it acquired in 2013. The carpooling feature in particular rankled Uber, a source close to the company said. "Things escalated from frenemy to now enemy quite quickly," said Anand Sanwal, CEO and co-founder of venture capital research firm CB Insights. The tension bubbled to the surface last August, when Drummond stepped down from Uber´s board. Uber declined comment on any of its dealings with Google and did not make Kalanick available for an interview. UNDERMINED BY ITS OWN INVESTORS? Uber´s aggressive culture was the subject of many conversations at Google Ventures, a source close to the transaction said. Hoping to influence the startup, the venture firm at first encouraged a flow of talent from Google to Uber. Yet that too ultimately created problems. Anthony Levandowski, a key engineering manager at the self-driving car unit, now called Waymo, began to talk openly about leaving the company as the autonomous vehicle field blossomed, according to Alphabet's lawsuit. In January 2016, Levandowski and some colleagues quit Alphabet to form the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired later that year for $680 million. Alphabet claims in its lawsuit that Levandowski had been in touch with Uber even before he left Alphabet. In the lawsuit, Alphabet alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 proprietary design documents and used them to create Otto's - and later Uber's - version of a key autonomous vehicle technology called Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position. Uber and Levandowski deny the allegations. The high-stakes legal showdown over whether vital information was transferred between the two companies is perhaps the logical conclusion of their opaque relationship. All along, Uber remained mysterious to its Google Ventures investors. Kalanick was adamant from the start that he would share little information, and try as it might, Google Ventures could not gain better visibility over time, two sources said. If anything, Kalanick grew more tight-lipped as his business matured. "It was one of the few companies where we sat there and said, 'Hope it goes well,'" one of the sources said.

Meanwhile, a separate report in January this year said Google is working on a budget phone code-named as Pixel 2B. Now a tipster has told 9to5Google that Google is indeed working on a budget smartphone but it will not have the Pixel branding. He further stated that as the budget phone will not have the Pixel branding, there is a possibility the device could be an Android One phone that is aimed at emerging markets and will not be released in the US. According to earlier rumors, the Pixel 2 will be waterproof, expected to be powered by Snapdragon 835 chip and come with an improved camera.The Pixel 2 is said to see at least $50 price increase, so it might start at $699. Meanwhile, details about the budget phone are scarce as of now. It remains to be seen if Google will give another shot to the struggling Android One program with this budget device.

Since then, LG has been bringing Android 7.0 to some of the other devices in its range, such as last year's G5 flagship, but owners of some of its older handsets have been left wondering when - or if - they'll get a taste of Nougat. For those who own the LG V10 and LG G4, that question has now been answered. In a statement to The Korea Herald, LG said: We plan to offer the upgrade of the operating system with Android 7.0 for the V10 in the second half of this year and for the G4 in the third quarter. Clearly, there's some good news there for V10 and G4 owners. While Google officially dropped support for the Snapdragon 800 and 801 chipsets with Nougat, the Snapdragon 808 used in the V10 and G4 is still supported (indeed, Google's own Nexus 5X has the same SoC, and recently received the Android 7.1.2 beta). LG had previously hinted that the V10 and G4 were 'not optimized' for Nougat, but following an outcry from customers, the company has clearly reversed its position. But while that change will no doubt be welcomed by those who still have a V10 or G4, the long wait for the update continues - and the update may not arrive until a full year after Nougat's original release. LG's statement also applied specifically to its rollout plans for South Korea, so the wait for those in other markets could be even longer.

Trump’s new conspiracy theory belies fawning punditry By James Warren • March 6, 2017 Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Good morning. Here's our morning roundup of all the media news you need to know. Want to get this briefing in your inbox every morning? Subscribe here. President Trump's speech to Congress prompted the press to act like a parent rewarding a toddler for not throwing up at the dinner table. It set the bar rather low, as he reminded the world over the weekend. It was just last Tuesday night that Van Jones of CNN cited one part of the speech and announced how Trump “became president of the United States in that moment, period.” Until a few days later, when Trump badmouthed President Obama and offered no evidence for a charge that he was wiretapped during the campaign. (@realDonaldTrump) It appeared he was responding to implications in a Breitbart News story, which then prompted Breitbart to assert that we should all blame The New York Times. (Breitbart) Yes, defending itself by saying it had merely aped that paragon of the evil mainstream media, The New York Times. Like Trump, it appears to crave validation by the same media it reflexively derides. But put aside the wiretap-related tweets. My own personal favorite came at 7:10 a.m. Eastern Saturday from Mar-a-Lago, presumably during a commercial break in the weekend edition of "Fox & Friends." "Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me," tweeted the newly "presidential" Donald Trump. "Sad end to great show." (@realDonaldTrump) So how does one square the Trump praised by pundits last week with the Maligner of Mar-a-Lago? Says Joe Conason, editor of the National Memo, "Like most Americans, our colleagues wish that America had a 'normal' president. But he has reminded us more than once that he can mimic presidential demeanor. This is a dangerous illusion that we shouldn't foist on the public." And, as put by Keith Olbermann to me Sunday: "From Chris Wallace to Van Jones, they provided insight that would last a lunchtime." An amazing saga continues The New York Times disclosed, rather amazingly, "The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, asked the Justice Department this weekend to publicly reject President Trump’s assertion that President Barack Obama ordered the tapping of Mr. Trump’s phones, senior American officials said on Sunday." CNN and The Washington Post were those who both quickly sought to cover the story and credited The Times. But one obvious question not quickly broached was this: What in the world is the difference between the FBI chief asking the Attorney General to call Trump claim B.S. and the FBI chief essentially going public and calling it B.S.? An obvious long profile: "James Comey: Sober law enforcer gone haywire." He screwed up the Hillary Clinton emails matter and now is way out front on this wiretap tale without quietly laboring to be part of a coherent Department of Justice position. As a Justice Department alum friend of mine says, Comey seems totally, completely self-absorbed. Our wayward warriors "The U.S. Department of Defense is investigating hundreds of Marines who used social media to solicit and share hundreds — possibly thousands — of naked photographs of women service members and veterans," writes Thomas James Brennan, a former Marine sergeant-turned-journalist and a Purple Heart winner for the Center for Investigative Reporting. (Reveal) As The Charlotte News & Observer reported, and his agent Stuart Krichevsky underscored, Brennan and family have received death threats. Through his agent comes this statement from Brennan: "The story I reported is obviously a highly sensitive one, and it’s no surprise that there have been some negative responses and threats made. However, the focus here should not be on me or the threats to my family, but on making sure the stories of the victims of these behaviors come to light." Google and "fake news" "During the initial dustup over 'fake news,' Google and its parent company Alphabet got less flack for spreading hoaxes than social media platforms like Facebook and Reddit. This week, the search giant is taking its lumps." (Recode) "First: BuzzFeed explained how Alphabet-owned YouTube became the 'engine' of false conspiracy theories like Pizzagate. Strike one." "Second: SearchEngineLand editor Danny Sullivan noticed that Google was passing off right-wing paranoia as the promoted answer to questions like, 'Is Obama planning a coup?' and, 'Is Obama planning martial law?' Strike two." As Snap ascended, they faltered TechCrunch's Joanna Glasner looks at all the once "hot" messaging apps that started going south, despite the initial adoration of tech investors, as Snap headed north. (TechCrunch) "Last year, the biggest tech IPO was Line, an unprofitable messaging app known for its cute animated stickers. Before Line, there was WhatsApp, which had just 55 employees in 2014 when it sold to Facebook for $19 billion. Twitter, not really a messaging tool but sharing many of the features, peaked a few years ago around a $40 billion valuation. Tencent-owned WeChat, China’s hottest messaging and productivity app, has an internal valuation some analysts have pegged around $80 billion." The FISA court Thanks to The Washington Post's Ellen Nakashima for a quick and solid backgrounder on the very secretive FISA court amid Trump's tweet-inspired journalists' own tweetstorm Saturday. The ignorance and conspiracy theories were rampant for much the day. Having a friend who served on the court, I cringed. (The Washington Post) Send in the clowns At the elite Gridiron Dinner in Washington Saturday, Mike Pence tried his hand at humor. On analysis of Trump's speech to Congress: “I even thought I heard Rachel Maddow start to say something nice, but then MSNBC immediately cut to commercial.” When it came to his own email mess: "The end of the week was a little embarrassing for me. Not that I had a personal email account when I was governor. [It] really was embarrassing for me to have millions of Americans learn that I’m one of the few people in the country to still have an AOL account." Guys, get some writers. Maybe fellow Hoosier David Letterman can assist. Double duty "Condé Nast is promoting one of its young star editors: Phillip Picardi. Starting March 13, Picardi will join Allure as digital editorial director while retaining the same role at Teen Vogue, where he has led the digital team since April 2015. Condé Nast confirmed the appointment." (Business of Fashion) Cuts at Commerce "White House proposes steep budget cut to leading climate science agency," declared The Washington Post. It focused on plans "to slash" the budget of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The New York Times referenced the Post story the next day in a piece on EPA cuts. Lost amid the implicit theme of odious Trump cuts was whether or not one might actually be able to find such cuts in a government agency without the end of the world beckoning. It's the sort of question the vast majority of beat reporters, even at A-list places like The New York Times and The Washington Post, are incapable of answering. They may know a fair bit about overall policies and politics of an agency but zilch about personnel quality, productivity and efficiency of those agencies with their multitude of separate departments, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I asked a former top Commerce official (a Democrat), who knows the 47,000-employee department cold, about whether that agency in particular could tolerate such cuts. The response? "Yes." Pravda's Sunday highlights The White House now offers its own press release on the "highlights" of the Sunday shows. It opened yesterday's with, "Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on ABC’s This Week: 'If this happened, if this is accurate, this is the biggest overreach and the biggest scandal.'" Huckabee's fumbling performance with sub-host Martha Raddatz was rightly skewered this morning by CNN’s Brian Stelter and Bill Carter, who noted Trump's "smear" against Obama and reliance on dubious conspiratorial sources. Creative relief Need a respite from journalists blogging (at times, it seems, for other journalists) about Trump, be it press conferences or speeches? Trying journalists blogging about art, in particular New York's big Armory Week art fair. (ARTnews) Want to know how a big installation by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, 87, began as a mere sketch on a napkin that she faxed over? That and much more can be found. The graying of our billionaires In a follow-up to its expanded Billionaire's Index, Bloomberg reports on how so many of American billionaires are just very old. "The problem is most acute in the U.S. and Europe, where about a quarter of the billionaires on the index are age 80 or older, compared to 20 percent in Asia." There there's this: "In mainland China, where only chemical maker Xu Chuanhua has reached that milestone, just 3 percent of the wealth is in the hands of the elderly, with about 40 percent held by billionaires under age 50." A reporter's latest ignominy Juan Thompson was described by one and all as a former disgraced reporter for The Intercept when word got out about his being charged "with making more than a half-dozen bomb threats against Jewish community centers, schools and a Jewish history museum, federal authorities said." (The New York Times) He had other stops. Michael Miner of the alternative Chicago Reader, wrote a year ago, "Has anyone ever been disowned faster than Juan Thompson?" Miner goes on. "He'd just been accused by the website the Intercept of fabricating quotes, creating fake email accounts, and impersonating other people, including the editor of the website. The site had described Thompson as a former reporter for DNAinfo Chicago and for WBEZ, but both media were quick to minimize their connections." "'He interned for us a few summers ago — VERY briefly,' tweeted DNAinfo's Jen Sabella. WBEZ's Ben Calhoun, the head of programming, said Thompson had been an intern for a talk show for four months and 'the extent of his duties was minimal.'" Miner noted how The Riverfront Times in St. Louis ran an opus on Thompson that argued "Thompson might have done more damage than more celebrated media fabricators such as Stephen Glass and Jayson Blair because in Thompson's time reporting is so much more rapidly (and carelessly) repurposed." (Riverfront Times) Saturday night at Mar-a-lago The Palm Beach Post reports, "Some 300 guests mingled with donors and doctors at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, sipping champagne and admiring the cherry blossoms and hydrangeas that decorated the tables in the grand ballroom, the one where President Donald Trump and wife, Melania, had celebrated their 2005 wedding." "But in other parts of the Trump-owned property, the mood was decidedly more serious. Guests caught glimpses of Trump meeting with members of his team, including Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and Gen. John Kelly, head of the Department of Homeland Security." There was Attorney General Jeff Sessions, too, but if he "was taken to the gilded woodshed at Mar-a-Lago, he showed no signs of it during a brief encounter with Bascom Palmer guests. In Mar-a-Lago’s grand salon, where tapestries hang heavy on the walls, Sessions was all smiles as he greeted the gala’s attendees." In search of online sizzle Headline on print version of Amanda Hess story in New York Times Magazine on internet trolling: "Clickbait." Headline on mobile version: "How the Trolls Stole Washington" The morning babble "Fox & Friends" opened with, what else, possible surveillance of Trump's New York office. It chided a key New York Times story for having unnamed sources (while MSNBC actually had one of the reporters). Co-host Brian Kilmeade said, with scant argument, that "in retrospect, it (Trump's) was a tweet that caused a lot of consternation," while badmouthing the integrity of James Clapper for a notoriously wrong 2013 statement about whether the NSA collected (so-called phone metadata) on millions of Americans. CNN's "New Day" noted that Hillary Clinton felt the FBI (Comey) was out to get her, now Trump thinks the intelligence community is undermining him. Citing the latest wiretap story, co-host Chris Cuomo said, "My main question every day is why?" He opted for the term "V.D.," for "virtual deception" — before switching to the North Korean missile program, and the Obama-era cyber war against it so vividly (and scarily) detailed over the weekend by The New York Times. Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC's "Morning Joe" found nothing especially "virtual" in our midst. We are viewing "no respect for the office (of president) and (Trump) calling the former president unbelievable names. We are at a low point in American history, and I don't know how anybody can defend this president even if it's their job." Any doubt about her take on things? Here's her speaking, and emoting, to Trump-ites: "And when you are out speaking for President Trump, I would urge you not laugh at yourself because this is not funny. This is really bad. just for the record, we're all really nervous. So if people out there feel really nervous, we do, too." Corrections? Tips? Please email me: jwarren@poynter.org.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Yelp blames Google for its failed international business Chris O'Brien@obrien March 6, 2017 4:15 AM Tags: Europe, Google, top-stories, Yelp Image Credit: GongTo/Shutterstock Yelp made the surprising decision last fall to shutter its international operations and focus on North America. Over the course of 12 years, the company had made astonishingly little progress growing its overseas business. So what went wrong? In the company’s recently filed annual report, Yelp identifies one of the culprits: Google. In discussing the decision to wind down international operations, Yelp added a section that reads: Google has previously made changes to its algorithms and methodologies that may be contributing to the slowing of our traffic growth rate, particularly in our international markets where we have less content and more competitors. We believe this headwind on our ability to achieve prominent display of our content in international unpaid search results disrupted the network effect we expected in our international markets based on what we experienced domestically, whereby increases in content led to increases in traffic. This was a contributing factor to our decision to reallocate our international sales and marketing resources. Yelp has had a long-running feud with Google, accusing Google of manipulating search results to favor its own products over Yelp’s. Indeed, Yelp was one of the chief sources of complaints leading to aggressive anti-trust investigations of Google by the European Commission. Google has steadfastly denied Yelp’s allegations. Last year, Yelp’s European policy chief, Kostas Rossoglou, said in an interview that anti-trust intervention by governments would be essential to letting the company compete. Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman even testified in front of Congress back in 2011 about the harmful impact of Google’s practices. Whatever the case, Yelp struggled over the years to gain traction outside of the U.S. and Canada. In 2013, international revenues represented 4.6 percent of its business. That fell to 2.2 percent in 2015. On an earnings call with analysts last month, the company said revenues had fallen to 1 percent by the fourth quarter of 2016 and that the company had fewer than 500 international advertisers. “That’s a pretty small portion of the business,” said Yelp CFO Charles Baker. “Remember, international revenue is about 1 percent of the total. We did, I think, about $2 million of revenue from international in the fourth quarter, and that gives you scaling of the advertiser base there.” Although Yelp said it would lay off 175 employees from its international operations, its overall headcount grew last year to 4,256 employees, from 3,825 in 2015. Investors, in general, have proven to be quite patient with Yelp. But since the past earnings report, the company’s stock fell to $33.37 per share at the close of trading on Friday, from $41.49 on Feb. 9 when Yelp reported earnings. Still, that’s well up from a year ago, when the stock dipped to $15.69 amid rumors that the company was possibly going to be sold.

There are no full specs as of yet, but Google says the device will be hitting shelves in mid-April. It’s a “rugged” convertible, with a front-facing camera designed to be used in tablet mode, USB-C charging, and an optional stylus — all features “designed for the specific needs of schools,” says Google, according to The Verge. From this brief picture, it seems the G11 will follow in the footsteps of a pair of Chrome OS laptops from Acer and Asus announced earlier this year.

A section called “Places the Locals Go,” is also made up of the most popular, highly-rated spots within Facebook.  Last year, Icelandair launched a new service allowing passengers to book their flight through Facebook Messenger, while KLM passengers became the first carrier to partner with Facebook in a new feature that allows fliers to check-in, get their boarding pass and receive flight status updates directly through Facebook Messenger. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week From voice to written notes via Ukrainian Senstone device (VIDEO) Google vows fix for ‘inappropriate’ search results Consumer Reports to consider cyber security in product reviews ‘Pokemon Go’ player dies from heart attack after catching rare Lapras in Singapore Facebook launches City Guides in latest app update China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard ‘Pokemon Go’ player dies from heart attack after catching rare Lapras in Singapore Axiata Digital, Huawei sign MoU to bring Internet of Things capabilities across Asia Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Related Articles Jumpa pelajar tepi lebuh raya, pemuda baik hati hantar pulang Facebook turns to artificial intelligence to tackle suicides Facebook’s Oculus cuts virtual reality headset price to spur sales Pesara pemurah sedekah 1,300 ekor ayam, sayur Waspada tawaran tiket murah palsu, kata AirAsia Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Not everyone at Google Ventures, since renamed GV, agreed. The firm already had an investment in a competitor, Sidecar, and Uber was demanding what then looked like a sky-high valuation. Maris and Krane prevailed, and the deal is now regarded as GV's greatest success. On paper, the firm's initial 2013 investment of $258 million gained about 14 times its value over the next three years to more than $3.5 billion. But now Alphabet, Google's corporate parent, is suing Uber for theft of trade secrets, alleging that one of the top engineers in its self-driving car program decamped with thousands of confidential files, including designs that helped him start self-driving truck company Otto and then quickly sell it to Uber. Uber denies those claims. The lawsuit, filed by Alphabet's self-driving car unit Waymo, has jolted the fast-growing and highly competitive industry that has sprung up around autonomous vehicles and ride services, which are seen as the future of private road transport. Yet the confrontation was a long time in the making: the complex relationship between the companies was tense from the start, according to people familiar with the situation, and soured further as they increasingly competed with each other. Now, if the Waymo suit damages Uber, GV's investment in the ride-hailing company stands to go down as a Silicon Valley rarity: a large funding deal undermined by the firm's own investors. "Whatever Waymo gains, Google Ventures loses," said Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University. The lawsuit is just one in a series of recent public setbacks for Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment that prompted an internal investigation, a video of Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that led him to make a public apology, and Uber's admission on Friday that it used a secret tracking tool to avoid authorities. "We have reviewed Waymo's claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court," Uber said in a statement in response to the lawsuit. "In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world." A spokeswoman for GV declined to comment. Deal at any cost Uber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map. Maris and Krane were early Uber fans, but it took about two years for the pair to connect with Kalanick. When Uber investor Benchmark finally brokered a meeting in May 2013, the Google Ventures partners were determined to do a deal at virtually any cost, according to two sources close to the transaction. With other would-be investors waiting in adjacent conference rooms at Uber's San Francisco offices, Maris and Krane made their pitch to invest. Kalanick pushed for a higher valuation, without a board seat; Google Ventures pushed back, asking for a board observer seat and a liquidation preference for protection if Uber was sold at a loss, one of the sources said. They finally came to terms, with a $3.5 billion valuation, and there were signs that a broader alliance could be in the offing. Separately, David Drummond, Google's senior vice president of corporate development, had a social relationship with Kalanick, and he joined the board. A ride in a self-driving car and a meeting with Google CEO LarryPage, recounted in Brad Stone's recent book "The Upstarts," seemed to bode well for the relationship. But conflicts emerged immediately. Kalanick, a tough negotiator, wanted a discount on the software tools behind Google Maps, the company's ubiquitous mapping software, according to a person close to the transaction. The best Google Ventures could offer was close contact between Uber and Google's mapping team, the person said. Kalanick also wanted Uber to be featured prominently in Google Maps, eventually giving customers a way to hail an Uber ride directly from Maps, and Google agreed, a source close to Uber said. But Uber felt Google dragged its heels on the integration and found the initial rollout disappointing, the source said. The friction only grew as Uber turned its attention to autonomous driving, an area where Google had already established an early lead. Uber announced its intentions in typically abrupt style in early 2015, poaching 40 faculty and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to set up a self-driving lab in Pennsylvania. It bought mapping software firm deCarta and began investing heavily in its own mapping systems. Meanwhile, Google launched an on-demand delivery service, a market Uber is also chasing, and began offering a carpooling service through driving app Waze, which it acquired in 2013. The carpooling feature in particular rankled Uber, a source close to the company said. "Things escalated from frenemy to now enemy quite quickly," said Anand Sanwal, CEO and co-founder of venture capital research firm CB Insights. The tension bubbled to the surface last August, when Drummond stepped down from Uber's board. Uber declined comment on any of its dealings with Google and did not make Kalanick available for an interview. Undermined by its own investors? Uber's aggressive culture was the subject of many conversations at Google Ventures, a source close to the transaction said. Hoping to influence the startup, the venture firm at first encouraged a flow of talent from Google to Uber. Yet that too ultimately created problems. Anthony Levandowski, a key engineering manager at the self-driving car unit, now called Waymo, began to talk openly about leaving the company as the autonomous vehicle field blossomed, according to Alphabet's lawsuit. In January 2016, Levandowski and some colleagues quit Alphabet to form the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired later that year for $680 million. Alphabet claims in its lawsuit that Levandowski had been in touch with Uber even before he left Alphabet. In the lawsuit, Alphabet alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 proprietary design documents and used them to create Otto's - and later Uber's - version of a key autonomous vehicle technology called Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position. Uber and Levandowski deny the allegations. The high-stakes legal showdown over whether vital information was transferred between the two companies is perhaps the logical conclusion of their opaque relationship. All along, Uber remained mysterious to its Google Ventures investors. Kalanick was adamant from the start that he would share little information, and try as it might, Google Ventures could not gain better visibility over time, two sources said. If anything, Kalanick grew more tight-lipped as his business matured. "It was one of the few companies where we sat there and said, 'Hope it goes well,'" one of the sources said.

PHOTO: REUTERS When Uber was raising venture capital in 2013, it was one of the hottest deals around – and no one was more eager to write a check than Bill Maris and David Krane of Google’s venture capital arm. Not everyone at Google Ventures, since renamed GV, agreed. The firm already had an investment in a competitor, Sidecar, and Uber was demanding what then looked like a sky-high valuation. Maris and Krane prevailed, and the deal is now regarded as GV’s greatest success. On paper, the firm’s initial 2013 investment of $258 million gained about 14 times its value over the next three years to more than $3.5 billion. But now Alphabet Inc, Google’s corporate parent, is suing Uber for theft of trade secrets, alleging that one of the top engineers in its self-driving car program decamped with thousands of confidential files, including designs that helped him start self-driving truck company Otto and then quickly sell it to Uber. Uber denies those claims. The lawsuit, filed by Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, has jolted the fast-growing and highly competitive industry that has sprung up around autonomous vehicles and ride services, which are seen as the future of private road transport. Google accuses Uber of stealing self-driving car technology Yet the confrontation was a long time in the making: the complex relationship between the companies was tense from the start, according to people familiar with the situation, and soured further as they increasingly competed with each other. Now, if the Waymo suit damages Uber, GV’s investment in the ride-hailing company stands to go down as a Silicon Valley rarity: a large funding deal undermined by the firm’s own investors. “Whatever Waymo gains, Google Ventures loses,” said Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University. The lawsuit is just one in a series of recent public setbacks for Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment that prompted an internal investigation, a video of Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that led him to make a public apology, and Uber’s admission on Friday that it used a secret tracking tool to avoid authorities. “We have reviewed Waymo’s claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court,” Uber said in a statement in response to the lawsuit. “In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.” A spokeswoman for GV declined to comment. Delay at any cost Uber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Technology Google Home says Barack Obama is planning a coup and all Republicans are Nazis Search engine's smart speaker was caught spreading fake news and conspiracy theories. By Owen Hughes March 6, 2017 11:29 GMT Google Home has been caught spreading fake newsGoogle Former US President Barack Obama is in cahoots with Chinese communists. That is according to Google Home at least, which seems to be having a hard time separating fake news from facts. As a result, the voice-activated speaker has been offering up some interesting answers to users' queries, including those related to the former Potus. Ask whether Obama is planning a coup, for example, and it'll tell you that "not only could Obama be in bed with the Communist Chinese but he may in fact be planning a Communist coup d'etat at the end of his term". Google Home was caught giving this questionable response to BBC technology reporter Rory Cellan-Jones. Follow the answer to the source and you'll find that Google's digital assistant has taken the information from a conspiracy theory published in February 2014 by right-wing news website, Western Journalism. Google Assistant also has some controversial views on Conservatism: Ask it if Republicans are fascists, it may tell you that "according to debate.org, Republicans equals Nazis," as it told Marketing Land Editor Danny Sullivan. Of course neither of these answers are true, and instead highlight a major flaw in the way Google sources its answers from the web. When you type a question into Google you'll often be shown a "featured snippet" at the top of the results page. This includes a summary of the answer extracted from the website, alongside a link to the page it came from. Naturally, the more outlandish the question the greater the likelihood that the answer will come from a questionable source. And this increases the likelihood that Google will offer an unverified or completely made-up answer to your question – such as the "fact" that five former US Presidents were supposedly members of the KKK. It doesn't help that it comes at a time when trust in the media is at an all-time low and fake news runs rampant. Social media sites have vowed to do more to stop it spreading through their platforms unchecked, with Facebook recently introducing a "disputed" tag for trending news containing potentially inaccurate information. After the problem was brought to attention by Quartz, Google fixed the issued manually. "Featured Snippets in Search provide an automatic and algorithmic match to a given search query, and the content comes from third-party sites," the company said. Unfortunately, there are instances when we feature a site with inappropriate or misleading content. When we are alerted to a Featured Snippet that violates our policies, we work quickly to remove them, which we have done in this instance. We apologize for any offense this may have caused."

So it comes as no surprise that a follow-up model is on the way later this year. Rick Osterloh is the head of Google's hardware department and he confirmed during an appearance at Mobile World Congress that the Pixel 2 was on the way. "There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it," he told AndroidPit.com .

The Pixel won favour for being a high-end smartphone with build quality to rival the likes of Apple. It was also free of the usual bloatware that accompanies most Android handsets. Osterloh confirmed that the next Pixel will stick to the premium design that worked so well last time. Unfortunately, that probably means a similar price tag to the £599 starting price of the current Pixel . "Pixel stays premium," Osterloh said. Read More Death of the bezel?

Therefore, we may not see a new Pixel until October 2017 - which would allow it to compete directly with the upcoming iPhone 8 .

By Aaron Ricadela. Added by Agency Staff on 6 March 2017. Saved under Editor's pick Tags: Alastair Curtis, Amazon, Apple, Bracken Darrell, Google, Logitech, Microsoft Tweet Since Bracken Darrell took over Logitech International four years ago, the company’s stock has quadrupled on robust sales of snazzy PC accessories that complement products by the likes of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google. But as Darrell plots his next move, those heavyweights are starting to look more like competitors than partners. Darrell’s goal: tying together TVs, appliances and voice-controlled devices — an area many of the globe’s biggest tech companies are trying to crack. “They want to be at the centre of connected homes but you’ve got to sleep with one eye open” because erstwhile allies may well become rivals, said IDC analyst Jonathan Gaw. Darrell insists the new strategy won’t be a dramatic change from the way Logitech has long operated. Its keyboards, wireless mice and neighborhood-rattling speakers have always fitted into the larger PC market, and in newer, faster-growing categories, Darrell has sought to make his offerings work with those of tech giants. Logitech’s UE Boom speakers understand Apple’s Siri and Google Now, its remotes use Amazon’s Alexa to control everything from TVs to lights and heating, and its accessories can turn iPads into mini laptops. Even as he pushes deeper into the smart home, Darrell says Logitech can find niches that will be profitable without raising the ire of the industry’s leaders. “There’s no way these big players are going to want to be in every little puddle around their operating systems,” says Darrell, 55, slouched in an Eames-inspired chair in Logitech’s Innovation Centre at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, a top Swiss technical university with long ties to the company. “We’ve always been in categories where the big players are.” To fund that strategy, Darrell aims to wring maximum profits from his PC mouse and keyboard business, which racks up sales of almost US$1bn/year with gross margins approaching 50%. That will let him enter new areas such as voice-controlled devices, video collaboration, and augmented-reality games. Investors will get an outlook for the fiscal year that starts in April at a meeting with Logitech management on 7 March in New York. Tavis McCourt, an analyst at Raymond James in Nashville, praises Darrell for turning around a company that was “really struggling to define what it was”. McCourt says he expects Logitech to develop keyboards for Internet-connected TVs and a device that might take voice commands for home automation, like Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. The big hitters have a massive advantage over Logitech, which has historically been better at commercialising others’ inventions than developing its own. Logitech, whose revenue is forecast to reach $2,2bn this year, devotes less than $150m annually to research and development. Microsoft last year spent about $12bn, Google $14bn and Amazon $16bn. That could make it tough for Logitech to build products with enough sophistication to command premium prices, said Torsten Sauter, head of Swiss Research at broker Kepler Cheuvreux. “The smart home looks difficult” for Logitech to crack, Sauter said. “They have no software, no ecosystem. Logitech is much more a design company than a tech company.” Logitech CEO Bracken Darrell Darrell joined Logitech after four years at Whirlpool and stints at General Electric and Procter & Gamble, where he ran Braun, the German maker of high-design shavers and clocks. His predecessor had been ousted in 2011 after profit cuts and a $34m writedown for the Revue, a keyboard for Google TV. Darrell says the company had lost its focus on design. “We had let our products slip and were just making black plastic,” Darrell said. While revenue was largely flat in Darrel’s first three years as he focused on cutting costs and shutting down or selling less-profitable businesses, retail sales this year are expected to grow at least 12% excluding currency fluctuations. More important, profit has more than tripled under Darrell. Darrell says he can succeed by stressing design and marketing to create hits like the UE Boom speakers, as well as novelties such as a “silent” mouse and a wireless dock for phones that lets users toggle between typing on their PC screen and smartphone. And Logitech has a long tradition of buying its way into new categories. The company in 2008 purchased Ultimate Ears, now its UE division, which represents 15% of Logitech’s sales and is growing at 25% annually. Last year, Darrell paid $50m for Jaybird, a Utah start-up that makes wireless headphones for runners, and he agreed to buy Saitek, a maker of mock steering wheels and airplane sticks for gamers, for $13m. Darrell says projects in the works include cloud services tied to Logitech products, such as storing video collected by home-surveillance cameras. He points to Spotlight, a $130 remote for presentations, as an example of the hardware and software integration and higher-quality manufacturing Logitech is shooting for. Its weighty aluminum feel and simple three-button design are reminiscent of Apple products, and it works with both Windows and Macs to highlight specific areas of a computer screen. Further out, Logitech is researching how gestures may replace computer mice and looking into devices designed for use in self-driving cars, said Alastair Curtis, a Nokia veteran Darrell hired in 2013 as design chief. “When I first joined, Logitech was not in a good place,” Curtis said. “I gave a brutal assessment.” Now, he says he’s happy with the company’s direction and position in relation to tech’s agenda-setters. “We’re closer to Apple than ever before.”  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 9Is it all over for Internet banking? 6Zuma orders welfare grants be paid 6Chaos as welfare payments crisis deepens 5Bank of Baroda ‘closing’ Gupta accounts 5SqwidNet IoT network now live in Gauteng Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

 Google promoted a fake conspiracy theory that Obama was planning a coup Rob Price Mar. 6, 2017, 5:51 AM 13,822 facebook linkedin twitter email print Former US president Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping.REUTERS/Greg Baker/Pool Obama is planning a secret communist coup to overthrow the United States government. At least, that's what Google says. The Californian search giant is being criticised because of how it promotes fake news and wild conspiracy theories on its smart home device and in its search results via the Featured Snippets feature — including the nutty claim that Obama is "in bed with the Communist Chinese." Below is a video — filmed by the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones — of Google Home spouting the nonsense answer. He asks the smart-home device "is Obama planning a coup?", to which it replies that "Obama may in fact be planning a Communist coup d'etat at the end of his term in 2016." And here's what happens if you ask Google Home "is Obama planning a coup?" pic.twitter.com/MzmZqGOOal — Rory Cellan-Jones (@ruskin147) March 5, 2017 So what's going on? It's Google's Featured Snippets feature that's the problem — and it's not the first time this kind of screw-up has happened. The feature takes info from around the web to provide the user with a definitive answer to a query without having to leave the search box. When you search "Who was the last King of England?" and it tells you "George VI," that's the feature at work. The text comes from Reference.com — but it is presented authoritatively by Google.Google A version of this feature is also available in Google Assistant, the company's virtual assistant that comes built into Google Home and some phones, providing snappy answers to users' queries. But unfortunately, there's a whole lot of inaccurate information on the internet, and Google isn't always great at identifying it. Here's another example. Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land, asks his Google Home "Are Republicans fascists?" The answer: "Yes. Republicans equals Nazis." Google Home: "Yes, republicans = nazis" pic.twitter.com/7HVQjyjbEq — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) March 5, 2017 These answers are alarming, but the problem isn't new. Google has been repeatedly criticised over false answers being promoted via the feature before. In December 2016, The Guardian reported that it promoted an answer saying that "every woman has some degree of her prostitute in her. Every woman has some evil in her." These are typically manually fixed when brought to Google's attention — but the danger remains that undiscovered answers will continue to fool people looking for information. In a post on Search Engine Land, Sullivan rounds up a number of other examples, some old and some new — including Google falsely claiming multiple US presidents were in the KKK. These screw-ups can be particularly dangerous on Google Home The fact that these kinds of answers are also being included on Google Home has the potential to be especially damaging because they are divorced of context. In search results, these dodgy answers appear to be endorsed by Google but the user can at least click through to check out the website it came from. When narrated by Google Home, on the other hand, it is presented authoritatively with only a brief "according to [website name]" before it is quoted verbatim.] Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement that "Featured Snippets in Search provide an automatic and algorithmic match to a given search query, and the content comes from third-party sites. Unfortunately, there are instances when we feature a site with inappropriate or misleading content. When we are alerted to a Featured Snippet that violates our policies, we work quickly to remove them, which we have done in this instance. We apologise for any offense this may have caused." Finally, the most farcical example might be when you search for "Who is the king of the United States?" The answer it provides — Barack Obama — is actually pulled from an article on Search Engine Land that criticises Google for the inaccuracy of its featured answers.

Not everyone at Google Ventures, since renamed GV, agreed. The firm already had an investment in a competitor, Sidecar, and Uber was demanding what then looked like a sky-high valuation. Maris and Krane prevailed, and the deal is now regarded as GV’s greatest success. On paper, the firm’s initial 2013 investment of $258 million gained about 14 times its value over the next three years to more than $3.5 billion. But now Alphabet Inc, Google’s corporate parent, is suing Uber for theft of trade secrets, alleging that one of the top engineers in its self-driving car program decamped with thousands of confidential files, including designs that helped him start self-driving truck company Otto and then quickly sell it to Uber. Uber denies those claims. The lawsuit, filed by Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, has jolted the fast-growing and highly competitive industry that has sprung up around autonomous vehicles and ride services, which are seen as the future of private road transport. Yet the confrontation was a long time in the making: the complex relationship between the companies was tense from the start, according to people familiar with the situation, and soured further as they increasingly competed with each other. Now, if the Waymo suit damages Uber, GV’s investment in the ride-hailing company stands to go down as a Silicon Valley rarity: a large funding deal undermined by the firm’s own investors. “Whatever Waymo gains, Google Ventures loses,” said Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University. The lawsuit is just one in a series of recent public setbacks for Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment that prompted an internal investigation, a video of Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that led him to make a public apology, and Uber’s admission on Friday that it used a secret tracking tool to avoid authorities. “We have reviewed Waymo’s claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court,” Uber said in a statement in response to the lawsuit. “In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.” Uber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map. Maris and Krane were early Uber fans, but it took about two years for the pair to connect with Kalanick. When Uber investor Benchmark finally brokered a meeting in May 2013, the Google Ventures partners were determined to do a deal at virtually any cost, according to two sources close to the transaction. With other would-be investors waiting in adjacent conference rooms at Uber’s San Francisco offices, Maris and Krane made their pitch to invest. Kalanick pushed for a higher valuation, without a board seat; Google Ventures pushed back, asking for a board observer seat and a liquidation preference for protection if Uber was sold at a loss, one of the sources said. They finally came to terms, with a $3.5 billion valuation, and there were signs that a broader alliance could be in the offing. Separately, David Drummond, Google’s senior vice president of corporate development, had a social relationship with Kalanick, and he joined the board. A ride in a self-driving car and a meeting with Google CEO Larry Page, recounted in Brad Stone’s recent book “The Upstarts,” seemed to bode well for the relationship. But conflicts emerged immediately. Kalanick, a tough negotiator, wanted a discount on the software tools behind Google Maps, the company’s ubiquitous mapping software, according to a person close to the transaction. The best Google Ventures could offer was close contact between Uber and Google’s mapping team, the person said. Kalanick also wanted Uber to be featured prominently in Google Maps, eventually giving customers a way to hail an Uber ride directly from Maps, and Google agreed, a source close to Uber said. But Uber felt Google dragged its heels on the integration and found the initial rollout disappointing, the source said. The friction only grew as Uber turned its attention to autonomous driving, an area where Google had already established an early lead. Uber announced its intentions in typically abrupt style in early 2015, poaching 40 faculty and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to set up a self-driving lab in Pennsylvania. It bought mapping software firm deCarta and began investing heavily in its own mapping systems. Meanwhile, Google launched an on-demand delivery service, a market Uber is also chasing, and began offering a carpooling service through driving app Waze, which it acquired in 2013. The carpooling feature in particular rankled Uber, a source close to the company said. “Things escalated from frenemy to now enemy quite quickly,” said Anand Sanwal, CEO and co-founder of venture capital research firm CB Insights. The tension bubbled to the surface last August, when Drummond stepped down from Uber’s board. Uber declined comment on any of its dealings with Google and did not make Kalanick available for an interview. UNDERMINED BY ITS OWN INVESTORS? Uber’s aggressive culture was the subject of many conversations at Google Ventures, a source close to the transaction said. Hoping to influence the startup, the venture firm at first encouraged a flow of talent from Google to Uber. Yet that too ultimately created problems. Anthony Levandowski, a key engineering manager at the self-driving car unit, now called Waymo, began to talk openly about leaving the company as the autonomous vehicle field blossomed, according to Alphabet’s lawsuit. In January 2016, Levandowski and some colleagues quit Alphabet to form the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired later that year for $680 million. Alphabet claims in its lawsuit that Levandowski had been in touch with Uber even before he left Alphabet. In the lawsuit, Alphabet alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 proprietary design documents and used them to create Otto’s – and later Uber’s – version of a key autonomous vehicle technology called Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position. Uber and Levandowski deny the allegations. The high-stakes legal showdown over whether vital information was transferred between the two companies is perhaps the logical conclusion of their opaque relationship. All along, Uber remained mysterious to its Google Ventures investors. Kalanick was adamant from the start that he would share little information, and try as it might, Google Ventures could not gain better visibility over time, two sources said. If anything, Kalanick grew more tight-lipped as his business matured. “It was one of the few companies where we sat there and said, ‘Hope it goes well,'” one of the sources said.—Reuters Tagged Alphabet Inc.

Powered by Orbitera, Test Drive is a fully functioning and interactive software demonstration that allows companies concerned about securing their cloud deployments to try Vormetric Transparent Encryption before buying it — no software license, credit card or even cloud account required. Vormetric Transparent Encryption enables organizations interested in leveraging the cloud to implement encryption and protect their sensitive assets and services, without having to make changes to applications, infrastructure or business practices. In addition to encrypting data, Vormetric Transparent Encryption also logs access and enforces policies that protect against unauthorized access by users and processes, through capabilities such as privileged user-access controls (highlighted in the test drive). The solution stops administrators, but more importantly malware impersonating them, from accessing data while preserving their ability to perform their day-to-day administrative responsibilities. It offers security intelligence, such as data access logging that can accelerate advanced persistent threat (APT) and insider threat detection. The Vormetric Live Data Transformation option helps improve security and data availability while reducing the operational costs associated with encryption by delivering near zero-downtime deployments, easy key rotation and versioned backups and archives. Thales also recently announced that its nShield hardware security modules (HSMs) can be used to securely generate and store customer supplied keys on-premises for Google Cloud Platform Customer Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) functionality. The new CSEK support empowers enterprise customers who want to move workloads and data to the Google Cloud Platform but need to retain control of their key material on-premises. C.J. Radford, global vice president, Cloud at Thales e-Security says:"With their elegantly engineered test drive, Google and Orbitera have created a simple and educational world where prospective customers can learn about Vormetric Transparent Encryption and better understand advanced features such as access control and access logging. Organizations interested in leveraging cloud resources must prove they are capable of maintaining control of their data, meeting a broad range of regulations and compliance requirements, and protecting that data wherever it may reside. While it sounds like a tall order, Vormetric Transparent Encryption can help meet customer needs– and with Google Test Drive prospects get to see it in action".

The company launched the first beta of Android Studio 2.3 back in December, shortly after the massive release of Android Studio 2.2. Developers have been testing the beta over the past couple of months, so it may not come as a surprise that Google has decided the software is stable enough to be released publicly. The new update builds upon the features many have already been testing in the beta. Android Studio 2.3 is not the crème de la crème filled with a trove of juicy new features as Android Studio 2.2 was. The focus of 2.3 is on the quality of features that were previously introduced. For example, Google has significantly tweaked the Instant Run feature to make it much more reliable. Pressing the Run button will now force an application restart so that the changes in your code are reflected in the application preview window. You can download Android Studio 2.3 for Windows, Mac, and Linux directly from Google’s Android Studio.

Earlier this week, cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks discovered 132 Android apps infected with malware in the Google Play store. One of the most popular apps had been downloaded more than 10,000 times. Google has removed the apps. Why are hackers targeting Android users? Simple – it’s easier. The Google-developed operating system is “more open and adaptable,” said security software company Sophos. Any app featured in the iOS store has gone through an in-depth examination – the thorough process blocks “widespread malware infection” among iPhone users, but malware targeting iOS-based systems is on the rise, according to a report from SIXGILL last month. Applications infected with malware are becoming problematic for app developers and users. Cybersecurity experts have warned smartphone owners to refrain from downloading third-party apps from unofficial sources, but the presence of malicious apps in official stores make it difficult for users to identify which ones can be trusted.

That one tweet heralded the discovery of Cloudbleed.

Join For Free Discover how to protect your applications from known and unknown vulnerabilities. On February 17th, Tavis Ormandy, a vulnerabilities researcher at Google, sent the tweet that kicked off 2017's biggest security story yet: "Could someone from cloudflare security urgently contact me." That's not something anyone wants to read on a Friday afternoon, but especially not when it's coming from one of the world's top infosec researchers. The problem? While doing some routine bug checking, Ormandy saw some data that did not match at all what he expected to find. "It's not unusual to find garbage, corrupt data, mislabeled data or just crazy non-conforming data...but the format of the data this time was confusing enough that I spent some time trying to debug what had gone wrong, wondering if it was a bug in my code," he wrote, "In fact, the data was bizarre enough that some colleagues around the Project Zero office even got intrigued." The rest of the Google Project Zero team (a team of security researchers employed specifically to find new zero-day exploits) probably expected Google's announcement of the first practical SHA-1 collision to be the big news of the week. As they looked closer, they found “encryption keys, cookies, passwords, chunks of POST data and even HTTPS requests” for all sorts of different sites using Cloudflare—private messages, reservations, plaintext API requests from a password manager, hotel bookings. How did all of this happen? Cloudflare Was Dumping Memory Across the Web It begins with a simple bug in the code to Cloudflare's highly popular reverse proxy service. HTTP requests to certain types of sites signed up with Cloudflare would trigger the bug, which would then "leak" data from random Cloudflare customers' sites (those that happened to be in memory at the time). A simple depiction of how a reverse proxy like Cloudflare's works. Since reverse proxies are shared between customers, data from all was at risk of being disclosed. Since September, random bits of data have been coming out of initialized memory and leaking across random Cloudflare customer's sites. In other words, if you went to visit a site that used Cloudflare, you could have had other people's sensitive information “leaking” into your own browsing session. When search engines “crawled” these pages to index them, the same kind of information “leaked.” Because search engines cache the output they receive when they visit a page, all these leaked tokens, secrets, and messages were indexed, split up and spread across millions of pages of search results. (Source: Wordfence) While Cloudflare is working with the major search engines to purge their caches of sensitive information now, it's hard to avoid thinking about the paranoid version of events. Paranoid version: state actors, or state-sponsored actors with significant resources, discovered this vulnerability before Google did. They found a way to send manipulated HTTP requests to Cloudflare sites that would output a predictable stream of user data—and have either packaged everything they found for resale or set about figuring out how to crack what could be billions of passwords, credit card numbers, and secret tokens. Cloudflare claims they can rule out this scenario with access logs, but whether or not that's true has been subject to some debate. What You Should Do Now The way that data was disclosed means that any site using Cloudflare could potentially have had its secrets and tokens compromised. Patreon, Yelp, Uber, Medium, Fitbit, and OKCupid all use Cloudflare—for a full list of sites you can click here. Several tools have also been built to assess your risk, like this script that crawls your Chrome history. Though many, many sites use Cloudflare, at least to some degree. It's still quite unlikely that your personal information has been exposed. Many of the individual sites mentioned have also come out and written posts to explain whether you should be concerned—perhaps most notably, 1Password, which was initially mentioned in Tavis's tweets as a potentially compromised site. The first thing you want to do to protect yourself from this and future incidents is to enable multifactor authentication. The most important sites to enable MFA on are the ones you use as an SSO iDP—if you're logging into 20 different sites using your Google credentials, then you definitely want to enable some form of MFA there. While it's unlikely your passwords were exposed, this is as good a reminder as any that you should be using strong, unique passwords and organizing them using a password manager. Resetting individual passwords for sites doesn't make much sense—the list of compromised sites is simply so vast. The only solution is to do a mass reset and make sure you're using proper password hygiene going forward. What You Should Do For Your Customers As a site operator, you're probably wondering 1) if you're at risk, and 2) if any of your users' data was exposed in this incident. Cloudflare has already reached out to domain owners that they have proactively identified as being at risk in this leak. However, the absence of notification does not mean that your domain (and customers) are safe. First off, enable multifactor authentication if you haven't already. It's the easiest way to get a huge boost to the security of your site. Many site operators have begun forcing password resets for all of their users. If you run a consumer site, it may not be worth the trouble and inconvenience. If your customers are in the enterprise, then it is probably a very good idea to force a change. If you're not going to make your users change their passwords (and from a cursory browse of the web this Monday morning, it appears that this is mostly the case), then you should at least recommend it. As far as data invalidation, any secrets which you can easily rotate—session identifiers, tokens, keys—should immediately be changed. Customer SSL keys do not appear to have been compromised in this incident, but it would be prudent to change as much data as you can which may have passed through Cloudflare. If you or any of your customers are regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), then you'll definitely want to have your security/compliance teams get in touch with your lawyers and discuss whether this is a breach that needs to be reported.

The feature automatically pulls in short answers to common queries from popular websites. It can show them in the search results directly, and is also the basis for the quick answers provided through Google’s smart speaker device, the Google Home. When it works, it leads to the search engine helpfully answering questions like “who is the richest man in the world” without requiring the user to click a further link – in this case, pulling eight names from a listicle on the Indian Express. But when it doesn’t, it pulls from sites sharing fake news, propaganda and simple lies. Worse, it can result in the Google Home reading the same statements as fact, without even the presence of the other search results to provide much needed contextual clues that the answers might be misleading. The device does, however, read out the name of the site which provides the original information. Over the weekend, asking Google, or the Google Home, “is Obama planning a coup” would pull in a quick answer from a site called Secrets of the Fed which stated: “According to details exposed in Western Centre for Journalism’s exclusive video, not only could Obama be in bed with the communist Chinese, but Obama may in fact be planning a communist coup d’état at the end of his term in 2016!” Rory Cellan-Jones (@ruskin147) And here's what happens if you ask Google Home "is Obama planning a coup?" pic.twitter.com/MzmZqGOOal March 5, 2017 Following the initial news reports, the search snippet was removed. But The Outline’s Adrianne Jeffries documented a huge number of other problematic results: search snippets claiming that monosodium glutamate causes brain damage, Barack Obama is the King of the US, and US president Warren Harding was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, in addition to less serious, but equally embarrassing, errors such as an answer about the smell of Iodine linking to a guide to cooking Meth, and one about why fire engines are red citing a Monty Python joke. The focus on search snippets comes at an awkward time for Google. The search engine has largely managed to avoid the media firestorm around “fake news”, which has instead landed at the feet of Facebook, due to the latter’s love of its algorithmic newsfeed. But the snippets can be seen as Google lending its own institutional authority to statements which, in fact, have no authority at all; that could greatly increase the potential damage caused by the spread of such falsehoods online. After a request for comment, a Google spokesperson said: “Featured Snippets in Search provide an automatic and algorithmic match to a given search query, and the content comes from third-party sites. Unfortunately, there are instances when we feature a site with inappropriate or misleading content. When we are alerted to a Featured Snippet that violates our policies, we work quickly to remove them, which we have done in this instance. We apologise for any offense this may have caused.” Google Alphabet Search engines Internet news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Truth is being walloped by outright lies.

Julia LoveHeather Somerville Uber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map. Photo: Reuters San Francisco: When Uber Technologies Inc was raising venture capital in 2013, it was one of the hottest deals around—and no one was more eager to write a check than Bill Maris and David Krane of Google’s venture capital arm. Not everyone at Google Ventures, since renamed GV, agreed. The firm already had an investment in a competitor, Sidecar, and Uber was demanding what then looked like a sky-high valuation. Maris and Krane prevailed, and the deal is now regarded as GV’s greatest success. On paper, the firm’s initial 2013 investment of $258 million gained about 14 times its value over the next three years to more than $3.5 billion. But now Alphabet Inc, Google’s corporate parent, is suing Uber for theft of trade secrets, alleging that one of the top engineers in its self-driving car program decamped with thousands of confidential files, including designs that helped him start self-driving truck company Otto and then quickly sell it to Uber. Uber denies those claims. The lawsuit, filed by Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, has jolted the fast-growing and highly competitive industry that has sprung up around autonomous vehicles and ride services, which are seen as the future of private road transport. Yet the confrontation was a long time in the making: the complex relationship between the companies was tense from the start, according to people familiar with the situation, and soured further as they increasingly competed with each other. Now, if the Waymo suit damages Uber, GV’s investment in the ride-hailing company stands to go down as a Silicon Valley rarity: a large funding deal undermined by the firm’s own investors. “Whatever Waymo gains, Google Ventures loses,” said Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University. Also Read | Uber’s ‘Greyball’ draws ire for blocking government stings The lawsuit is just one in a series of recent public setbacks for Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment that prompted an internal investigation, a video of Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that led him to make a public apology, and Uber’s admission on Friday that it used a secret tracking tool to avoid authorities. “We have reviewed Waymo’s claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court,” Uber said in a statement in response to the lawsuit. “In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.” A spokeswoman for GV declined to comment. Deal at any cost Uber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map. Maris and Krane were early Uber fans, but it took about two years for the pair to connect with Kalanick. When Uber investor Benchmark finally brokered a meeting in May 2013, the Google Ventures partners were determined to do a deal at virtually any cost, according to two sources close to the transaction. With other would-be investors waiting in adjacent conference rooms at Uber’s San Francisco offices, Maris and Krane made their pitch to invest. Kalanick pushed for a higher valuation, without a board seat; Google Ventures pushed back, asking for a board observer seat and a liquidation preference for protection if Uber was sold at a loss, one of the sources said. They finally came to terms, with a $3.5 billion valuation, and there were signs that a broader alliance could be in the offing. Separately, David Drummond, Google’s senior vice president of corporate development, had a social relationship with Kalanick, and he joined the board. A ride in a self-driving car and a meeting with Google CEO Larry Page, recounted in Brad Stone’s recent book “The Upstarts,” seemed to bode well for the relationship. But conflicts emerged immediately. Kalanick, a tough negotiator, wanted a discount on the software tools behind Google Maps, the company’s ubiquitous mapping software, according to a person close to the transaction. The best Google Ventures could offer was close contact between Uber and Google’s mapping team, the person said. Also Read | Uber used secret tool ‘Greyball’ to evade authorities Kalanick also wanted Uber to be featured prominently in Google Maps, eventually giving customers a way to hail an Uber ride directly from Maps, and Google agreed, a source close to Uber said. But Uber felt Google dragged its heels on the integration and found the initial rollout disappointing, the source said. The friction only grew as Uber turned its attention to autonomous driving, an area where Google had already established an early lead. Uber announced its intentions in typically abrupt style in early 2015, poaching 40 faculty and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to set up a self-driving lab in Pennsylvania. It bought mapping software firm deCarta and began investing heavily in its own mapping systems. Meanwhile, Google launched an on-demand delivery service, a market Uber is also chasing, and began offering a carpooling service through driving app Waze, which it acquired in 2013. The carpooling feature in particular rankled Uber, a source close to the company said. “Things escalated from frenemy to now enemy quite quickly,” said Anand Sanwal, CEO and co-founder of venture capital research firm CB Insights. The tension bubbled to the surface last August, when Drummond stepped down from Uber’s board. Uber declined comment on any of its dealings with Google and did not make Kalanick available for an interview. Undermined by its own investors? Uber’s aggressive culture was the subject of many conversations at Google Ventures, a source close to the transaction said. Hoping to influence the startup, the venture firm at first encouraged a flow of talent from Google to Uber. Yet that too ultimately created problems. Anthony Levandowski, a key engineering manager at the self-driving car unit, now called Waymo, began to talk openly about leaving the company as the autonomous vehicle field blossomed, according to Alphabet’s lawsuit. In January 2016, Levandowski and some colleagues quit Alphabet to form the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired later that year for $680 million. Alphabet claims in its lawsuit that Levandowski had been in touch with Uber even before he left Alphabet. In the lawsuit, Alphabet alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 proprietary design documents and used them to create Otto’s—and later Uber’s—version of a key autonomous vehicle technology called Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position. Uber and Levandowski deny the allegations. The high-stakes legal showdown over whether vital information was transferred between the two companies is perhaps the logical conclusion of their opaque relationship. All along, Uber remained mysterious to its Google Ventures investors. Kalanick was adamant from the start that he would share little information, and try as it might, Google Ventures could not gain better visibility over time, two sources said. If anything, Kalanick grew more tight-lipped as his business matured. “It was one of the few companies where we sat there and said, ‘Hope it goes well,’” one of the sources said.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 6 March 2017 | MYT 5:14 PM Alphabet lawsuit against Uber cements end of uneasy marriage Legal tangles: Alphabet Inc is suing Uber for theft of trade secrets. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO: When Uber Technologies Inc was raising venture capital in 2013, it was one of the hottest deals around – and no one was more eager to write a check than Bill Maris and David Krane of Google's venture capital arm. Not everyone at Google Ventures, since renamed GV, agreed. The firm already had an investment in a competitor, Sidecar, and Uber was demanding what then looked like a sky-high valuation. Maris and Krane prevailed, and the deal is now regarded as GV’s greatest success. On paper, the firm's initial 2013 investment of US$258mil (RM1.1bil) gained about 14 times its value over the next three years to more than US$3.5bil (RM15.5bil). But now Alphabet Inc, Google's corporate parent, is suing Uber for theft of trade secrets, alleging that one of the top engineers in its self-driving car programme decamped with thousands of confidential files, including designs that helped him start self-driving truck company Otto and then quickly sell it to Uber. Uber denies those claims. The lawsuit, filed by Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, has jolted the fast-growing and highly competitive industry that has sprung up around autonomous vehicles and ride services, which are seen as the future of private road transport. Yet the confrontation was a long time in the making: the complex relationship between the companies was tense from the start, according to people familiar with the situation, and soured further as they increasingly competed with each other. Now, if the Waymo suit damages Uber, GV's investment in the ride-hailing company stands to go down as a Silicon Valley rarity: a large funding deal undermined by the firm's own investors. “Whatever Waymo gains, Google Ventures loses,” said Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University. The lawsuit is just one in a series of recent public setbacks for Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment that prompted an internal investigation, a video of Chief executive Travis Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that led him to make a public apology, and Uber's admission on Friday that it used a secret tracking tool to avoid authorities. “We have reviewed Waymo's claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court," Uber said in a statement in response to the lawsuit. "In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.” A spokeswoman for GV declined to comment. Deal at any cost Uber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map. Maris and Krane were early Uber fans, but it took about two years for the pair to connect with Kalanick. When Uber investor Benchmark finally brokered a meeting in May 2013, the Google Ventures partners were determined to do a deal at virtually any cost, according to two sources close to the transaction. With other would-be investors waiting in adjacent conference rooms at Uber’s San Francisco offices, Maris and Krane made their pitch to invest. Kalanick pushed for a higher valuation, without a board seat; Google Ventures pushed back, asking for a board observer seat and a liquidation preference for protection if Uber was sold at a loss, one of the sources said. They finally came to terms, with a US$3.5bil (RM15.5bil) valuation, and there were signs that a broader alliance could be in the offing. Separately, David Drummond, Google's senior vice president of corporate development, had a social relationship with Kalanick, and he joined the board. A ride in a self-driving car and a meeting with Google CEO Larry Page, recounted in Brad Stone's recent book The Upstarts, seemed to bode well for the relationship. But conflicts emerged immediately. Kalanick, a tough negotiator, wanted a discount on the software tools behind Google Maps, the company's ubiquitous mapping software, according to a person close to the transaction. The best Google Ventures could offer was close contact between Uber and Google’s mapping team, the person said. Kalanick also wanted Uber to be featured prominently in Google Maps, eventually giving customers a way to hail an Uber ride directly from Maps, and Google agreed, a source close to Uber said. But Uber felt Google dragged its heels on the integration and found the initial rollout disappointing, the source said. The friction only grew as Uber turned its attention to autonomous driving, an area where Google had already established an early lead. Uber announced its intentions in typically abrupt style in early 2015, poaching 40 faculty and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to set up a self-driving lab in Pennsylvania. It bought mapping software firm deCarta and began investing heavily in its own mapping systems. Meanwhile, Google launched an on-demand delivery service, a market Uber is also chasing, and began offering a carpooling service through driving app Waze, which it acquired in 2013. The carpooling feature in particular rankled Uber, a source close to the company said "Things escalated from frenemy to now enemy quite quickly," said Anand Sanwal, CEO and co-founder of venture capital research firm CB Insights. The tension bubbled to the surface last August, when Drummond stepped down from Uber’s board. Uber declined comment on any of its dealings with Google and did not make Kalanick available for an interview. Undermined by its own investors? Uber’s aggressive culture was the subject of many conversations at Google Ventures, a source close to the transaction said. Hoping to influence the startup, the venture firm at first encouraged a flow of talent from Google to Uber. Yet that too ultimately created problems. Anthony Levandowski, a key engineering manager at the self-driving car unit, now called Waymo, began to talk openly about leaving the company as the autonomous vehicle field blossomed, according to Alphabet's lawsuit. In January 2016, Levandowski and some colleagues quit Alphabet to form the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired later that year for US$680mil (RM3bil). Alphabet claims in its lawsuit that Levandowski had been in touch with Uber even before he left Alphabet. In the lawsuit, Alphabet alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 proprietary design documents and used them to create Otto's – and later Uber's – version of a key autonomous vehicle technology called Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position. Uber and Levandowski deny the allegations. The high-stakes legal showdown over whether vital information was transferred between the two companies is perhaps the logical conclusion of their opaque relationship. All along, Uber remained mysterious to its Google Ventures investors. Kalanick was adamant from the start that he would share little information, and try as it might, Google Ventures could not gain better visibility over time, two sources said. If anything, Kalanick grew more tight-lipped as his business matured. “It was one of the few companies where we sat there and said, 'Hope it goes well,'" one of the sources said. —  Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Malaysian shuttlers safe after an eventful flight to Birmingham Pyongyang bans Malaysians from leaving N.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 6 March 2017 | MYT 4:57 PM After working with tech giants, Logitech prepares to fight them Ambitious goal: Even as he pushes deeper into the smart home, Darrell says Logitech can find niches that will be profitable without raising the ire of the industry’s leaders. — Reuters Since Bracken Darrell took over Logitech International SA four years ago, the company’s stock has quadrupled on robust sales of snazzy PC accessories that complement products by the likes of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.  As Darrell plots his next move, those heavyweights are starting to look more like competitors than partners. Darrell’s goal: tying together TVs, appliances and voice-controlled devices – an area many of the globe’s biggest tech companies are trying to crack.  “They want to be at the centre of connected homes but you’ve got to sleep with one eye open” because erstwhile allies may well become rivals, said IDC analyst Jonathan Gaw.  Darrell insists the new strategy won’t be a dramatic change from the way Logitech has long operated. Its keyboards, wireless mice, and neighbourhood-rattling speakers have always fit into the larger PC market, and in newer, faster-growing categories, Darrell has sought to make his offerings work with those of tech giants. Logitech’s UE Boom speakers understand Apple’s Siri and Google Now, its remotes use Amazon’s Alexa to control everything from TVs to lights and heating, and its accessories can turn iPads into mini-laptops.  Even as he pushes deeper into the smart home, Darrell says Logitech can find niches that will be profitable without raising the ire of the industry’s leaders.  “There’s no way these big players are going to want to be in every little puddle around their operating systems,” says Darrell, 55, slouched in an Eames-inspired chair in Logitech’s “Innovation Centre” at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, a top Swiss technical university with long ties to the company. “We’ve always been in categories where the big players are.”  To fund that strategy, Darrell aims to wring maximum profits from his PC mouse and keyboard business, which racks up sales of almost US$1bil (RM4.45bil) a year with gross margins approaching 50%. That will let him enter new areas such as voice-controlled devices, video collaboration, and augmented-reality games. Investors will get an outlook for the fiscal year that starts in April at a meeting with Logitech management March 7 in New York.  Tavis McCourt, an analyst at Raymond James in Nashville, praises Darrell for turning around a company that was “really struggling to define what it was.” McCourt says he expects Logitech to develop keyboards for internet-connected TVs and a device that might take voice commands for home automation, like Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home.  The big hitters have a massive advantage over Logitech, which has historically been better at commercialising others’ inventions than developing its own. Logitech, whose revenue is forecast to reach US$2.2bil (RM9.77bil) this year, devotes less than US$150mil (RM667.65mil) annually to research and development. Microsoft last year spent about US$12bil (RM53.41bil), Google US$14bil (RM62.22bil), and Amazon US$16bil (RM71.11bil).  That could make it tough for Logitech to build products with enough sophistication to command premium prices, said Torsten Sauter, head of Swiss Research at broker Kepler Cheuvreux.  “The smart home looks difficult” for Logitech to crack, Sauter said. “They have no software, no ecosystem. Logitech is much more a design company than a tech company.”  Darrell joined Logitech after four years at Whirlpool and stints at General Electric Co and Procter & Gamble Co, where he ran Braun, the German maker of high-design shavers and clocks. His predecessor had been ousted in 2011 after profit cuts and a US$34mil (RM151.33mil) writedown for the Revue, a keyboard for Google TV. Darrell says the company had lost its focus on design.  “We had let our products slip and were just making black plastic,” Darrell said.  While revenue was largely flat in Darrel’s first three years as he focused on cutting costs and shutting down or selling less-profitable businesses, retail sales this year are expected to grow at least 12% excluding currency fluctuations. More important, profit has more than tripled under Darrell.  Darrell says he can succeed by stressing design and marketing to create hits like the UE Boom speakers, as well as novelties such as a “silent” mouse and a wireless dock for phones that lets users toggle between typing on their PC screen and smartphone.  And Logitech has a long tradition of buying its way into new categories. The company in 2008 purchased Ultimate Ears, now its UE division, which represents 15% of Logitech’s sales and is growing at 25% annually. Last year, Darrell paid US$50mil (RM222.55mil) for Jaybird, a Utah startup that makes wireless headphones for runners, and he agreed to buy Saitek, a maker of mock steering wheels and airplane sticks for gamers, for US$13mil (RM57.86mil).  Darrell says projects in the works include cloud services tied to Logitech products, such as storing video collected by home-surveillance cameras. He points to Spotlight, a US$130 (RM579) remote for presentations, as an example of the hardware and software integration and higher-quality manufacturing Logitech is shooting for. Its weighty aluminium feel and simple three-button design are reminiscent of Apple products, and it works with both Windows and Macs to highlight specific areas of a computer screen.  Further out, Logitech is researching how gestures may replace computer mice and looking into devices designed for use in self-driving cars, said Alastair Curtis, a Nokia veteran Darrell hired in 2013 as design chief.  “When I first joined, Logitech was not in a good place,” Curtis said. “I gave a brutal assessment.” Now, he says he’s happy with the company’s direction and position vis a vis tech’s agenda-setters. “We’re closer to Apple than ever before.” — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Analyst Reports , Life & Style , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested IBM, Maersk in blockchain tie-up for shipping industry REDtone appoints Tunku Tun Aminah as chairman Malaysian shuttlers safe after an eventful flight to Birmingham Rich Gen-Y kids making their own mark Kampung Baru Kelab Suleiman Gallery left abandoned, falling to pieces This photographer takes striking shots with mobile camera Others Also Read Taiwan a friendly stop for Muslims Maguire confident Tigers can claw out of danger Laying the foundation for talent advertisement Latest News Agencies urged to be assertive in pursuing enforcement of competition law TomTom banks on partnerships to help drivers escape traffic jams Celcom offers RM1mil worth of cash prizes for shoot-em-up game South Korean startups band together to survive in land of the chaebol WhatsApp joins arsenal of online luxury amid race for customers Most Viewed in Tech WhatsApp joins arsenal of online luxury amid race for customers South Korean startups band together to survive in land of the chaebol Celcom offers RM1mil worth of cash prizes for shoot-em-up game Uber needs more than ‘leadership help’ for its boss: opinion TomTom banks on partnerships to help drivers escape traffic jams Uber skids have Lyft steering for passing lane Snap shares sink as IPO euphoria vanishes Photo Kit: Another one bites the dust Facebook doesn’t understand German, at least not in court Honor 6X: Phone on a budget Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Editor’s Note: Brian Guy is Director of Cloud Services for Dev9, a custom software development firm focused on cloud services. Thanks to innovation from companies such as Amazon with AWS, Microsoft with Azure, and Google with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), organizations of all sizes are today increasingly more agile and competitive. Cloud provider partners like Dev9 enable organizations to optimize their journey to the Cloud. But on Tuesday, February 28, 2017, many people found that their smart phone applications were no longer working properly, many web sites were down and the Internet in general just seemed broken. This is what happens when AWS, the largest Cloud provider, experiences a “service disruption.” What makes this past week’s outage unique is that unlike prior outages, “service disruptions” or “service events” as Amazon calls them, this week’s web site outages and mobile application failures were not the result of organizations not following Amazon’s best practices, otherwise known as the “Well-Architected Framework.” In prior AWS outages, such as the 2016 “Service Event in the Sydney Region” where an entire Availability Zone (AZ) failed, organizations that followed Amazon’s Well-Architected best practices were not negatively impacted. This 2017 outage will no doubt cause Amazon to reassess its Well-Architected Framework and introduce new best practices focused on S3 availability. Indeed, even the AWS Service Health Dashboard (SHD) itself was impacted due to its dependency on S3 in a single region. Amazon has now re-architected its dashboard to be multi-region. What Is the AWS Well-Architected Framework and Why Does It Matter? The success of AWS is largely dependent on the success of its customers. If customers do not architect and implement optimally, it hurts the reputation of AWS. If customers have outages, poor performance, very high spend or security issues on AWS, this similarly hurts AWS. To help its customers and by extension help itself, AWS introduced the Well-Architected Framework on October 2, 2015. The AWS Well-Architected Framework initially focused on four pillars: Security Reliability Performance Efficiency Cost Optimization In November 2016, after a year of thousands of reviews carried out by AWS Solutions Architects, a fifth pillar was added: Operational Excellence For startups and smaller organizations that do not have a significant investment in on-premises hardware, deploying to the Cloud is often the default decision in 2017. The agility and flexibility of Cloud computing, combined with the lower startup costs, help these organizations spend less time and money on infrastructure and computing resources. For large enterprises, however, deploying to the Cloud is a significant incremental cost until redundant on-premises resources are retired. This process can take years, resulting in higher costs in the near term over 3-5 years (or more). Moreover, the paradigm shift from capital expenditures to higher operating expenses (CapEx to OpEx) can face internal political pressure that can slow down the entire process of migrating and modernizing legacy applications, while also innovating new applications in the Cloud. Smaller, more nimble competitors instantly have access to the global infrastructure of AWS or Azure, thereby eliminating a prior significant barrier to entry. These new competitors force enterprise customers to adopt the Cloud (despite it being an incremental cost in the near term) in order to innovate and obtain the agility required to effectively and efficiently compete in 2017. Amazon’s Well-Architected Framework helps these organizations set up for success in the Cloud. What is Amazon S3? Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is object storage. In modern computing, storage is typically divided into being file level storage, block storage or object storage. File level storage is found on Network Attached Storage (NAS) and typically works in conjunction with a protocol such as SMB (think Windows shares) or NFS (popular in Unix and Linux environments). Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), which is similar to NFS, and Azure File Storage, which uses SMB, are examples of Cloud-based file storage. Block storage is what you find in your PC or local storage on a server, and it usually – but not always – includes a file system (e.g., NTFS, FAT32, ext3, Btrfs) on top. Some database servers, such as Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database, are capable of writing directly (referred to as a RAW partition) without needing the overhead of the file system on top. In AWS, local instance storage (also called ephemeral storage) and Elastic Block Store (EBS) are examples of block storage. In Azure, Premium Storage is an example of block storage on SSD. Storage area networks (SANs) also use block storage. Object storage, unlike file level storage and block storage, does not need to be accessed via an operating system like Linux or Windows. It can be accessed directly via APIs or via http(s), making it optimal for web applications. Brian Guy As storage costs dropped, as megapixels on cameras and phones continued to increase and as users started wanting to store and share gigabytes and even terabytes of large objects, object storage met a need that is not efficiently met by block storage or file level storage. While block storage is excellent for operating system files, relational database records and Office documents, it is not optimal for a feature-length HD movie (think Netflix’s needs). Object storage allows Netflix to store its movies, allows photo sharing sites to store your photos, allows music streaming services to store their songs, allows iCloud to store a backup of your iPhone, allows video game publishers to store their games for download…and much more. Amazon S3 is Amazon’s object store. In Azure, this service is referred to as Blob Storage (blob = Binary Large Object). Why Did So Many Things Break When Just Object Storage Had a Problem? AWS promotes a best practice of moving all web static content – such as images and style sheets – off of more expensive EC2 instances and on to S3. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is Amazon’s name for a virtual server. EC2 expense is frequently a large portion of an organization’s AWS spend, so offloading work from EC2 to S3 can be a best practice for cost optimization. For example, a web site running on a fleet of EC2 instances might link to S3 for all of its images and other static content, and it might rely on EC2 itself only for dynamic content creation. This removes load from the EC2 instances, thereby potentially decreasing the number of EC2 instances needed and/or decreasing the size and specifications of the EC2 instances. Similarly, if a content delivery network (CDN) such as CloudFront, Azure CDN or Akamai can pull static assets off of S3 instead of from EC2 instances, this reduces load on more expensive virtual servers. In addition, for static web pages that only have client-side scripting and do not need server-side dynamic content, the entire page can be hosted on S3. In other words, S3 can even act as a simple web server, completely removing the need for any EC2 instances. Lastly, many AWS services are dependent on S3. Therefore, when S3 is down, other AWS services may not work as expected. According to Amazon, “Other AWS services in the US-EAST-1 Region that rely on S3 for storage, including the S3 console, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) new instance launches, Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes (when data was needed from a S3 snapshot), and AWS Lambda were also impacted while the S3 APIs were unavailable.” The US-EAST-1 (N. Virginia) region is one of the most heavily-used regions in the AWS global infrastructure, so the outage occurring in this region likely impacted a higher number of customers than if the outage had occurred in a different, smaller region. Why Weren’t Some Sites and Applications Impacted? It is misleading to state that AWS was down or that the Internet was down when in fact a single AWS service in a single region was experiencing a disruption. This is a trend where the media might report the outage being larger than it is, primarily due to so many popular web sites and mobile applications being impacted. The fact is that an optimal multi-region architecture would not have been impacted by Tuesday’s S3 outage. When a single Availability Zone (AZ) in the Sydney region experienced an outage in 2016, optimally architected sites and applications continued to run as designed. But popular sites and applications that were not designed optimally indeed triggered reports that all of Amazon – even that the Internet itself – was down in Australia. In addition, sites and applications that use S3 in a different region were not impacted since the outage was isolated to a single region. And sites and applications that do not rely on S3 were not impacted, unless they relied on another AWS service that was impacted by the S3 outage. What Happened? What Caused This Rare S3 Outage? Amazon touts S3 has having an impressive 11 nines (99.999999999%) of durability, so how could this happen? And what does 11 nines really mean? We first need to differentiate durability versus availability. Durability refers to the lack of data loss, whereas availability refers to the data being available. Eleven nines of durability effectively means you are very unlikely to lose any data on S3 – even if you use S3 in a single region – if you choose the Standard storage class. The Reduced Redundancy storage class decreases durability to 99.99%. It is assumed there was no data loss in the February 2017 S3 outage. Amazon disclosed that a small number of customers lost data from EBS volumes during the Sydney outage in 2016. While durability refers to the risk of data loss, availability refers to the risk of an outage or the service not being available. S3, when used in a single region, is “designed for” 99.99% (4 nines) of availability and includes a service level agreement (SLA) for 99.9% (3 nines) of availability. By comparison, EC2 provides an SLA of 99.95% (what I call 3½ nines) when deployed to at least two Availability Zones (AZs). High Availability and All Those Nines Three nines (99.9%) of uptime means that the service can be unavailable no more than 8.76 hours over the course of a year. Four nines (99.99%) means it can be unavailable no more than 52.56 minutes per year. Five nines (99.999%) means 5.26 minutes per year. Note the significant difference of about 9 hours versus about 5 minutes when comparing 3 nines to 5 nines. That extra 0.009% adds significant cost and complexity to a solution. This outage was caused partially by human error and partially by not doing regular testing of system restarts. Amazon’s postmortem indicates it had been several years since the S3 systems in this region had been restarted. Testing restarts is a fairly common best practice but also a fairly common source of problems when not conducted on a regular basis. It is of course preferred to identify post-restart problems as a part of a scheduled test, for example after applying updates, and not after an unexpected or unplanned restart. Some headlines blame the outage on a simple typo, but of course the problem is much more complex and involves process, testing, scripting, fault domains and customers employing multi-region redundancy when appropriate. A more detailed postmortem explanation of what happened is available here. It is worth noting that AWS is consistent in sharing its findings a few days after an incident. This transparency benefits the entire cloud community and helps everyone to architect for inevitable incidents. S3 in Multiple Regions as a Best Practice Historically, Amazon’s position has been that multi-region architectures are not necessary for a Highly Available (HA) solution. Instead, the advice has been to deploy a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to at least two Availability Zones (AZs) within a region. AZs are located miles apart from each other, are on separate flood plains and have redundant power and Internet connectivity. In last year’s Sydney outage, one AZ became unavailable during an extreme weather event. Customers in Sydney who architected to multiple AZs as Amazon recommends remained up. Customers who relied on a single AZ and had selected the impacted AZ experienced downtime. But S3 does not reside within an AZ. With S3, you only select a Region. You can indeed have an S3 endpoint within an AZ, but your data in S3 reside within a Region, not within an AZ. It can therefore act as a potential single point of failure (SPOF) when only a single region is utilized. So far, Amazon has not prescribed multi-region S3 implementations as a part of its “Well-Architected Framework” in order to eliminate this SPOF. Perhaps because of S3’s track record of stability and availability, architects have generally been complacent with using S3 in a single region. Multi-region implementations of any service introduce cost and complexity, and high availability has always been a balancing act of trading off expensive complexity against an additional 9 of availability. But the fact remains that S3 has a 99.9% (3 nines) SLA, so some added complexity may be required if your business requirements exceed 3 nines. If your application is largely based on S3 – a photo sharing web site or mobile application, for example – introducing a second region for S3 could double your storage costs. But the added storage costs may be required in order to reduce risk of an outage. Perhaps only a subset of your object data need the higher availability provided by a second S3 region given the significant durability offered by a single S3 region. Because its own dashboard was also impacted, Amazon itself is now introducing multi-region S3 for its AWS Service Health Dashboard (SHD). We can expect to see new guidance introduced in a revision to the Well-Architected Framework as a result of this outage. S3 as a SPOF Problem An infrastructure is only as good as its weakest link, and many implementations today include S3 as a single point of failure. This is sometimes on the advice of Amazon to move static web sites and static content to S3, but there is currently no recommendation or prescribed best practice to make S3 multi-region.  An infrastructure is only as good as its weakest link, and many implementations today include S3 as a single point of failure. Based on customer feedback, Amazon is rolling out more multi-region functionality, and it is indeed now simpler (but not necessarily inexpensive) to replicate S3 content to another region. But the primary message from AWS remains that deploying to multiple Availability Zones within a single region is sufficient. Then, use a content delivery network (CDN), such as CloudFront, to get that content closer to end users. The fact that this does not address the high availability of S3, and the fact that S3 remains a single point of failure, remains an outstanding risk today. Another explanation for many organizations keeping S3 in a single region is that there can be significant legal considerations when replicating customer data across countries. While it is straightforward to replicate data within a country, it is more complex to replicate data out of a country. For example, some countries do not allow certain data to enter the United States. Replicating data across regions – especially across geopolitical boundaries – typically requires assistance from legal counsel. Corporate counsel is not known for its agility or fast pace. With All This Info, What Can You Do? Option 1: Do Nothing; It’s Good Enough One valid option is to do nothing, and keep S3 in a single region. So many sites and applications go down when AWS has an outage that your customers will forgive you as soon as they realize much of the Internet is down. Just be sure to deploy VPC services such as EC2 to at least two Availability Zones, since social media is unforgiving to organizations that only deploy to one AZ or otherwise violate well-known best practices (see sample tweets in our seminar about the Sydney outage, referenced above). But do consider at least replicating data to another region for disaster recovery purposes, even if that data will not be accessed by your application. A best practice is for the disaster recovery region to be in a completely different AWS account in order to minimize the “blast radius” if your primary account is compromised.  Option 2: Multi-Region S3 and DNS with Health Checks It is fairly straightforward to replicate your S3 objects to a second (or third) region (see instructions here for how to do this), but then how do you get your application to only utilize an S3 region that is healthy? How do you handle an outage like the one that occurred in February? One option is to update your application logic (but this can be expensive), and you may have application code that is simply too risky to modify. In these situations, DNS is your friend. DNS (Domain Name System) is the magic that converts an address like “www.google.com” into an actual IP address of 216.58.216.164, so that you can use friendly names instead of actual IP addresses. More importantly, this also allows the underlying IP addresses to change without breaking the application. If your application points to a DNS address such as photos.objectstore.mycompany.com in order to load or save your user’s photos, for example, then this address can resolve to one or more S3 regions. Which S3 regions are actually used when retrieving photos can be determined by Health Checks. Some DNS services – like offerings from AWS and Azure – can automatically remove unhealthy destinations if they do not pass a health check. For example, the N. Virginia region of S3 could have been automatically removed during its outage, and applications could have diverted to a different region instead. Health Checks are not supported by all DNS servers, so multiple options are discussed below. If you are using Amazon Route 53 as your DNS solution, this is as simple as configuring Health Checks and DNS failover as described here. Microsoft Azure has a similarly simple solution, and this feature is broken out into a separate service called Azure Traffic Manager. Similar to Route 53, you can configure Azure Traffic Manager to only send traffic to healthy endpoints. Since Azure Traffic Manager supports non-Azure endpoints, it should (in theory, not yet tested) be possible to have Azure Traffic Manager manage multiple Amazon S3 endpoints (in the case of a multi-cloud environment), only sending traffic to healthy S3 regions. Details on Azure Traffic Manager can be found here. If you are using an older DNS solution, such as BIND, that doesn’t support Health Checks, then there are a few options. The first option is very simple but not ideal: implement DNS Round Robin between multiple S3 regions, and then manually remove the IP address for an unhealthy S3 endpoint when that region fails. This is not technically Highly Available since manual intervention is required, and it is not a best practice. But it is an option that can minimize downtime versus having everything in one S3 region. In this scenario, it is important to have low TTL values for DNS caching. This option may be appropriate for a hobby web site or other web site where you do not want added complexity and you are comfortable simply editing the DNS records when an outage occurs. This option is not appropriate for production web sites or applications that require true high availability with automated failover. With this option, there may still be a small amount of downtime for a subset of users (the subset who received the IP address of the failed region until you remove it), but it is better than all users being pointed to a single region that is down. Another option is a third-party solution that does health checks and sits in between your DNS and the application. This would be similar to how Amazon’s Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) can route traffic to only healthy EC2 instances. ELB does not currently support S3. HAProxy is a popular choice for on-premises solutions and could be adapted to manage traffic to S3 regions. However, it would be important not to make this layer a new single point of failure. Over time, we may see Amazon evolve ELB to also support multi-region S3. Option 3: Select a Lower Risk Region Unless you have a need to use the US-EAST-1 (N. Virginia) region, use US-WEST-2 (Oregon) instead. There are indeed valid reasons to select US-EAST-1, and I frequently advise customers to choose this region, but if there is no need, then default to Oregon. Amazon’s position is that all regions are equal, and my recommendation is not an Amazon stated best practice. My recommendation is based on my own observations working with AWS since 2008 Conclusion It will be interesting to see what Amazon recommends now that S3 has presented itself as a single point of failure not currently addressed in Amazon’s Well-Architected Framework. Amazon itself has made an architectural change and enhanced its status page to now be multi-region given its own outage due to the S3 single point of failure.  Despite the incidents that have occurred and will continue to occur, the major Cloud platforms are still significantly more reliable, significantly more secure, and in the long run, more cost effective than on-premises architectures. Amazon moves quickly, so we can expect some new guidance and an update to the Well-Architected Framework sooner rather than later. While learning from this outage and from prior Cloud outages, it is worth calling out the relatively rapid time to resolution and the significant army of resources that Amazon or Microsoft can deploy to a problem. These are resources you do not directly pay for, and the depth and breadth of these resources are not resources you can employ in-house, unless perhaps you are Facebook or Google. Most readers of this document are not Facebook or Google and significantly benefit from the resources and expertise that Amazon or Microsoft provide you with when you embrace their Cloud platform. Despite the incidents that have occurred and will continue to occur, the major Cloud platforms are still significantly more reliable, significantly more secure, and in the long run, more cost effective than on-premises architectures. These outages should not cause pause to Cloud adoption but rather should highlight the fast time to resolution and the Cloud expertise your organization gains when partnering up with one of the major Cloud providers.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Assembly Elections 2017: Is Modi on a road to nowhere in Uttar Pradesh? SAN FRANCISCO: When Uber Technologies Inc was raising venture capital in 2013, it was one of the hottest deals around - and no one was more eager to write a check than Bill Maris and David Krane of Google's venture capital arm. Not everyone at Google Ventures, since renamed GV, agreed. The firm already had an investment in a competitor, Sidecar, and Uber was demanding what then looked like a sky-high valuation. Maris and Krane prevailed, and the deal is now regarded as GV's greatest success. On paper, the firm's initial 2013 investment of $258 million gained about 14 times its value over the next three years to more than $3.5 billion. But now Alphabet Inc, Google's corporate parent, is suing Uber for theft of trade secrets, alleging that one of the top engineers in its self-driving car program decamped with thousands of confidential files, including designs that helped him start self-driving truck company Otto and then quickly sell it to Uber. Uber denies those claims. The lawsuit, filed by Alphabet's self-driving car unit Waymo, has jolted the fast-growing and highly competitive industry that has sprung up around autonomous vehicles and ride services, which are seen as the future of private road transport. Yet the confrontation was a long time in the making: the complex relationship between the companies was tense from the start, according to people familiar with the situation, and soured further as they increasingly competed with each other. Now, if the Waymo suit damages Uber, GV's investment in the ride-hailing company stands to go down as a Silicon Valley rarity: a large funding deal undermined by the firm's own investors. "Whatever Waymo gains, Google Ventures loses," said Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University. The lawsuit is just one in a series of recent public setbacks for Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment that prompted an internal investigation, a video of Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that led him to make a public apology, and Uber's admission on Friday that it used a secret tracking tool to avoid authorities. "We have reviewed Waymo's claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court," Uber said in a statement in response to the lawsuit. "In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world." A spokeswoman for GV declined to comment. DEAL AT ANY COS T Uber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map. Maris and Krane were early Uber fans, but it took about two years for the pair to connect with Kalanick. When Uber investor Benchmark finally brokered a meeting in May 2013, the Google Ventures partners were determined to do a deal at virtually any cost, according to two sources close to the transaction. With other would-be investors waiting in adjacent conference rooms at Uber's San Francisco offices, Maris and Krane made their pitch to invest. Kalanick pushed for a higher valuation, without a board seat; Google Ventures pushed back, asking for a board observer seat and a liquidation preference for protection if Uber was sold at a loss, one of the sources said. They finally came to terms, with a $3.5 billion valuation, and there were signs that a broader alliance could be in the offing. Separately, David Drummond, Google's senior vice president of corporate development, had a social relationship with Kalanick, and he joined the board. A ride in a self-driving car and a meeting with Google CEO Larry Page, recounted in Brad Stone's recent book "The Upstarts," seemed to bode well for the relationship. But conflicts emerged immediately. Kalanick, a tough negotiator, wanted a discount on the software tools behind Google Maps, the company's ubiquitous mapping software, according to a person close to the transaction. The best Google Ventures could offer was close contact between Uber and Google's mapping team, the person said. Kalanick also wanted Uber to be featured prominently in Google Maps, eventually giving customers a way to hail an Uber ride directly from Maps, and Google agreed, a source close to Uber said. But Uber felt Google dragged its heels on the integration and found the initial rollout disappointing, the source said. The friction only grew as Uber turned its attention to autonomous driving, an area where Google had already established an early lead. Uber announced its intentions in typically abrupt style in early 2015, poaching 40 faculty and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to set up a self-driving lab in Pennsylvania. It bought mapping software firm deCarta and began investing heavily in its own mapping systems. Meanwhile, Google launched an on-demand delivery service, a market Uber is also chasing, and began offering a carpooling service through driving app Waze, which it acquired in 2013. The carpooling feature in particular rankled Uber, a source close to the company said. "Things escalated from frenemy to now enemy quite quickly," said Anand Sanwal, CEO and co-founder of venture capital research firm CB Insights. The tension bubbled to the surface last August, when Drummond stepped down from Uber's board. Uber declined comment on any of its dealings with Google and did not make Kalanick available for an interview. UNDERMINED BY ITS OWN INVESTORS? Uber's aggressive culture was the subject of many conversations at Google Ventures, a source close to the transaction said. Hoping to influence the startup, the venture firm at first encouraged a flow of talent from Google to Uber. Yet that too ultimately created problems. Anthony Levandowski, a key engineering manager at the self-driving car unit, now called Waymo, began to talk openly about leaving the company as the autonomous vehicle field blossomed, according to Alphabet's lawsuit. In January 2016, Levandowski and some colleagues quit Alphabet to form the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired later that year for $680 million. Alphabet claims in its lawsuit that Levandowski had been in touch with Uber even before he left Alphabet. In the lawsuit, Alphabet alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 proprietary design documents and used them to create Otto's - and later Uber's - version of a key autonomous vehicle technology called Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position. Uber and Levandowski deny the allegations. The high-stakes legal showdown over whether vital information was transferred between the two companies is perhaps the logical conclusion of their opaque relationship. All along, Uber remained mysterious to its Google Ventures investors. Kalanick was adamant from the start that he would share little information, and try as it might, Google Ventures could not gain better visibility over time, two sources said. If anything, Kalanick grew more tight-lipped as his business matured. "It was one of the few companies where we sat there and said, 'Hope it goes well,'" one of the sources said.

Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle The self-driving car’s family tree 1 / 3 Back to Gallery As recent lawsuits show, many California companies developing self-driving cars are related to each other. It’s not always a happy family. Key engineers and executives from pioneering companies such as Google and Tesla have jumped ship to form their own self-driving startups, such as Lucid Motors and Otto. Google’s program, in turn, was shaped by a handful of engineers from two universities: Stanford and Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, a hotbed of self-driving research since the 1980s. Given the high stakes, it’s not surprising that some of the companies where these engineers landed don’t get along. In January, Tesla sued one of its former self-driving executives, Sterling Anderson, and his new startup, Aurora Innovation. Anderson co-founded Aurora last year with Chris Urmson, the former head of Google’s self-driving unit, which is now known as Waymo. Driving the Future Future self-driving cars will have ‘Intel inside’ And last month, Waymo sued Otto, founded by former Google researcher Anthony Levandowski. Waymo also sued Uber, which bought Otto last year. Both Tesla and Waymo accused their former employees of stealing trade secrets (Aurora denied the allegations and Uber said it is reviewing the suit). Here’s a partial family tree of the self-driving industry, showing how some of the key players have moved from one company or school to another. Give it a year, and the tree may well grow a few more branches. David R. Baker is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: dbaker@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @DavidBakerSF David R.

Image: Kotomiti Okuma/Shutterstock The Indonesian Komodo National Park is the relatively surprising recipient of the latest Google Doodle, marking 37 years since its creation. If you wanted to visit volcanic islands with white, sandy beaches and an abundance of Komodo dragons pottering about, where would you head? Indonesia’s Komodo National Park is your best bet, and the location’s 37th anniversary is being celebrated with today’s Google Doodle. The interactive doodle is actually a quiz, with five true-or-false questions to help us inquisitive folk find out more about the planet’s largest lizards. Google, to support the Doodle, lauds the park’s landscape, which is “unlike any other, ranging from dry savanna conditions to lush forests, all surrounded by white-sand beaches and bright, blue water. Komodo dragons have flexible skulls About 6,000 Komodo dragons live in the boundaries of the Komodo National Park. There are also dozens of species of bird nesting there, with the marine life circulating the islands including sea turtles, dolphins and whales. For food, the Komodo dragons live off Timor deer in the main part, consuming half their body weight in just one meal. “Despite the plethora of native wildlife, Komodo dragons are still what the park is best known for,” said Google. “Thanks to National Parks like Komodo, wildlife can continue to thrive, largely uninterrupted by human interference.” Like sharks, Komodo dragon teeth are replaceable Earlier this month, a study into Komodo dragon blood found numerous elements that could result in better antibiotics for humans. 48 never-before-seen antimicrobial peptides were found in the blood, some of which work exceedingly well against pathogenic bacteria. The study paints a bright future for scientists working to fight against antibiotic-resistant bugs, a major concern for future healthcare. Certain parental strains of some of the most troubling types of these bugs were successfully beaten by the Komodo blood.

In this post, I would like to address a few aspects of this issue, on which everyone from Twitter pundits to Donald Trump has a point of view: Is Fake News a new/Recent /Nascent phenomenon? I don’t think so. The idea of Fake news is probably as old as the idea of news itself, and the same applies to the idea of using Fake News for electoral benefits. The first recorded incident of using fake news goes back to Rome in 1522, where Pietro Aretino tried to manipulate the pontifical election by writing wicked sonnets about all the candidates except his favorite one. The NewYork Review of Books recently published a fascinating post on history of Fake News( link). Eric Burns in his eye opening book Infamous Scribblers provides a fascinating account of how until the recent past, all mainstream media was involved in politically motivated journalism and manipulation of public opinion. These tactics involved everything from partial truth to misinformation to outright lying. Have a look at the attached screenshot to know some of that . In the more recent past, there was Jessica Lynch and her Gulf war story. Advertisement (click here to view full size image) So Fake News is not new. What is new is that we are now talking about it, and our understanding of fake news is very binary. We love to think that a news item is either true or false. I believe its slightly more complicated than that, and truth is more nuanced . We need a more detailed framework to understand it . To explain this I request you to indulge me a little bit, and allow me to wear my product manager hat for a while. A news item has two components: Authenticity of the Information and Agenda of the Publication. Let us assume that Authenticity of Information is shown on X axis (as shown below), and it varies from an outright lie to a factual and verifiable Truth, to a Subjective Opinion . In the same fashion lets assume that the Agenda of Publication is shown on Y axis. In this case, the pendulum swings from purely commercial objective (advertisement / page views) to Journalistic responsibility, to partisan or ideological servitude for political purpose. If we put these two things together we get a frame work for thinking about media publication, what drives them and what kind of  journalism they practice. Every publication, every news source, and every news story can be placed in one of the four quadrants here. Each of these quadrant also has its own optimal method for content generation and distribution.   As you can see, in 3 out of 4 quadrants, the dominant distribution model is centralized. Fortunately for much of history, consumers were also on a centralized channel. The first wave of Internet pushed media companies to move from Paper  to the website, but this was more of a format and medium change. Whether a news desk, or newspaper or news-site, the basic mechanism of information dissemination  was still a centralized  broadcast. The challenge for media companies was mostly of content adaptation and discovery. It is no wonder that two of the biggest companies of first wave were Netscape and Google. Things got more interesting with the second wave of the Internet. Blogging and self publishing started a trend which got fuelled with the advent of social web and smartphone. Instead of traversing the Internet from webpage to webpage, people started traversing from one person to another. Behavior like Back-linking and Bookmarking got replaced with Follow, Subscribe, Share, Rate and Like. Eyeballs shifted to Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. Distribution and creation of content became democratized and more importantly, decentralized. The genie was out of the bottle. Decentralized content creation means a decentralized and diffused responsibility of ensuring authenticity. The stage was set for emergence of Fake News. One interesting aspect of this whole discussion is the role and responsibility of content discovery and distribution platforms like Google, Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter in ensuring the authenticity of news hosted on their platform. The idealistic and knee-jerk response is: The Platform is not responsible for the content hosted on them, thanks to the Safe Harbor provision. However the underlying, unstated assumption in that regulation is that these platforms are a  common carrier, i.e. content neutral pipes like a phone and postal services. So, like phone companies and postal services aren’t liable for what people send using their services, the same should apply for Facebook also . But off late, this analogy is not holding up. One reason is that in practice, the algorithm of Facebook (newsfeed)/Google (ranking) selects and prioritizes content from an available pool, so that user gets to see whats most relevant for them. In this sense, they are not exactly content neutral. The algorithm embodies and reflects the bias of the person who designed it.  The other distinction is that common carriage, like phone and postal services, don’t directly profit from the contents of  letters, and packages. Google, Facebook, and so on, directly profit from the content, not from providing the service. So the case for not holding these platforms responsible is not as straight-forward as we think. However what scares me more is the possibility where these platform becomes arbiters of truth and authenticity. Who will decide the moral compass and guidelines on what’s allowed or appropriate? A government with a political agenda or a corporation with commercial (and political?) agenda? None of these options look good to me . A [Possible] Solution When I think about how can we possibly solve this problem, I can’t help but notice one thing: The ranking and sorting algorithm of underlying platforms like Facebook. Have you noticed that, somehow, we were able to keep this thing contained in pre-social-web version of the Internet. Google was responsible for discovery, and I am sure sometime false stories made it to top. However, since their ranking algorithm mostly depended on an externality (number of backlinks), and not on content itself, that made it difficult and uneconomical for someone to invest in gaming the system for something with a low shelf life like News. On the other hand, the discovery of Newsfeed, Share and WhatsApp Forwards are optimized for viral and low shelf life content. There are cases where Newsfeed was used for purposes other than serving most relevant content to user. Remember Zynga and Farmville? Remember how frequently you used to see those notifications in your stream, and how they have vanished now. I am sure one reason for this decline in visibility is fall in overall usage, improvement of the algorithm, but I am also sure that one reason is that Zynga is not a big advertiser with FB any more. Some informed people make a similar case for Google also. For any effective enforcement of authentic news distribution we need to have two things : (1) The primary criteria driving the content discovery should be outside of the perimeter of platform. Google’s backlink is an external attribute but most of “signal” in social web, like “share”,“like “, “fav”, “follow” are baked into their respective platforms. Thus, to exercise them, the user has to be on the platform and exposed to it. This put more weight on algorithm. We need a better understanding of the Newsfeed algorithm. Not control but visibility and  understanding. I haven’t spent much time studying it  but I believe that a combination of text mining along with Epidemiological algorithms and bayesian filtering can solve this problem to a great extent. (2) Platform should have strict guidelines about which “signals” are being used as input for content targeting, and which are being used for advertisement targeting. They should probably disclose them too. Right now these boundaries are very porous. More than that since these signals can be conflicting, so platform should disclose the policy guideline on how such conflicts are handled. For example: Would you show a story on effect of irresponsible tourism on everest base camp trail to a user who is a camper, and likes a page of an Online Travel Agent, subscribes a You Tube channel on camping and has clicked on links of Travel Deals in past? Surprisingly, most of the privacy debate today is centered around advertisement targeting, and not on content targeting. This needs to change. Again, I repeat, we need more understanding and less control. Platform knows the best. I am suggesting probably they should disclose more. I am not suggesting that anyone should dictate what they can or can not use as signal. Epilogue: Any discussion about news and and its dissemination mechanism eventually boils down to question of Why? Why do you want to understand it ? Who will take responsibility that this knowledge will not be used for things like censorship, clamping down on free speech. These are uncomfortable questions but these risks are real. Often time the liberal ideological escape route is to shift the burden of verification to end customer.  I believe this is evasion of responsibility. I am responsible for what I believe, and how I act on that information, but my surrounding environment is also responsible for what I got exposed to, and what stimulation and conditioning is provided to me. So if there is an agenda driving that exposer I need to be informed about the same. A slightly provocative way of putting the same argument is to say that while freedom of speech might give you the right to shout “Fire, Fire “ in a crowded cinema hall, but if someone does that and there is a stampede, we shouldn’t hold them responsible for doing so. * Disclaimer from the Author: Prashant Singh works with Paytm but the views expressed here are personal Disclaimer from MediaNama: views expressed here are the authors, and not necessarily those of MediaNama Also read: What is Fake News How and why is Fake News spreading Dealing with Fake News A Fake News reading list 01 Related ##NAMApolicy #Fake News #Internet #Media #News Related How and why is Fake News spreading?

As Darrell plots his next move, those heavyweights are starting to look more like competitors than partners. Darrell’s goal: tying together TVs, appliances and voice-controlled devices -- an area many of the globe’s biggest tech companies are trying to crack. “They want to be at the center of connected homes but you’ve got to sleep with one eye open” because erstwhile allies may well become rivals, said IDC analyst Jonathan Gaw. Bracken Darrell Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg Darrell insists the new strategy won’t be a dramatic change from the way Logitech has long operated. Its keyboards, wireless mice, and neighborhood-rattling speakers have always fit into the larger PC market, and in newer, faster-growing categories, Darrell has sought to make his offerings work with those of tech giants. Logitech’s UE Boom speakers understand Apple’s Siri and Google Now, its remotes use Amazon’s Alexa to control everything from TVs to lights and heating, and its accessories can turn iPads into mini-laptops. Even as he pushes deeper into the smart home, Darrell says Logitech can find niches that will be profitable without raising the ire of the industry’s leaders. “There’s no way these big players are going to want to be in every little puddle around their operating systems,” says Darrell, 55, slouched in an Eames-inspired chair in Logitech’s “Innovation Center” at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, a top Swiss technical university with long ties to the company. “We’ve always been in categories where the big players are.” To fund that strategy, Darrell aims to wring maximum profits from his PC mouse and keyboard business, which racks up sales of almost $1 billion a year with gross margins approaching 50 percent. That will let him enter new areas such as voice-controlled devices, video collaboration, and augmented-reality games. Investors will get an outlook for the fiscal year that starts in April at a meeting with Logitech management March 7 in New York. Tavis McCourt, an analyst at Raymond James in Nashville, praises Darrell for turning around a company that was “really struggling to define what it was.” McCourt says he expects Logitech to develop keyboards for internet-connected TVs and a device that might take voice commands for home automation, like Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. The big hitters have a massive advantage over Logitech, which has historically been better at commercializing others’ inventions than developing its own. Logitech, whose revenue is forecast to reach $2.2 billion this year, devotes less than $150 million annually to research and development. Microsoft last year spent about $12 billion, Google $14 billion, and Amazon $16 billion. That could make it tough for Logitech to build products with enough sophistication to command premium prices, said Torsten Sauter, head of Swiss Research at broker Kepler Cheuvreux. “The smart home looks difficult” for Logitech to crack, Sauter said. “They have no software, no ecosystem. Logitech is much more a design company than a tech company.” Darrell joined Logitech after four years at Whirlpool and stints at General Electric Co. and Procter & Gamble Co., where he ran Braun, the German maker of high-design shavers and clocks. His predecessor had been ousted in 2011 after profit cuts and a $34 million writedown for the Revue, a keyboard for Google TV. Darrell says the company had lost its focus on design. “We had let our products slip and were just making black plastic,” Darrell said. While revenue was largely flat in Darrel’s first three years as he focused on cutting costs and shutting down or selling less-profitable businesses, retail sales this year are expected to grow at least 12 percent excluding currency fluctuations. More important, profit has more than tripled under Darrell. Darrell says he can succeed by stressing design and marketing to create hits like the UE Boom speakers, as well as novelties such as a “silent” mouse and a wireless dock for phones that lets users toggle between typing on their PC screen and smartphone. And Logitech has a long tradition of buying its way into new categories. The company in 2008 purchased Ultimate Ears, now its UE division, which represents 15 percent of Logitech’s sales and is growing at 25 percent annually. Last year, Darrell paid $50 million for Jaybird, a Utah startup that makes wireless headphones for runners, and he agreed to buy Saitek, a maker of mock steering wheels and airplane sticks for gamers, for $13 million.

Sign Up Darrell says projects in the works include cloud services tied to Logitech products, such as storing video collected by home-surveillance cameras. He points to Spotlight, a $130 remote for presentations, as an example of the hardware and software integration and higher-quality manufacturing Logitech is shooting for. Its weighty aluminum feel and simple three-button design are reminiscent of Apple products, and it works with both Windows and Macs to highlight specific areas of a computer screen. Further out, Logitech is researching how gestures may replace computer mice and looking into devices designed for use in self-driving cars, said Alastair Curtis, a Nokia veteran Darrell hired in 2013 as design chief. “When I first joined, Logitech was not in a good place,” Curtis said. “I gave a brutal assessment.” Now, he says he’s happy with the company’s direction and position vis a vis tech’s agenda-setters. “We’re closer to Apple than ever before.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.
