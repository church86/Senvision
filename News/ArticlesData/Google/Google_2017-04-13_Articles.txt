YouTube TV is official, includes 40+ networks for $35/month Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/02/28 1:55pm PDTFeb 28, 2017 182 Plus 1 on G+ 4482 Share on Facebook 142 Share on Twitter Total Shares4806 Applications Google News YouTube or Google offering traditional TV networks has been rumored for ages, and now it is finally official. Today Google unveiled 'YouTube TV,' a new subscription service offering dozens of TV networks, cloud DVR, and YouTube Red originals for just $35 a month. Obviously the library of TV networks will make or break YouTube TV, but Google is off to a pretty good start. YouTube TV includes ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN, and dozens of other local sports and cable networks (see the below picture for all of them). Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus are available for an additional charge. Google's aim is to make watching TV more like watching YouTube, so one of the big selling points is Cloud DVR. Much like Xfinity and similar TV providers, recordings of shows are kept online for easy access. There is no storage limit or simultaneous recording limit, but recordings are deleted after nine months. There are a few additional benefits to YouTube TV worth mentioning. You can have up to six user accounts, with separate recommendations and DVRs, and up to three users can stream TV at once. The service also includes all YouTube Red Originals, and works on Android, iOS, and Chromecasts/Chromecast-compatible TVs. We've double checked with Google — YouTube TV does not include the ad-free YouTube Red subscription or Google Play Music membership, only YouTube Red Originals. As mentioned above, YouTube TV only costs $35 a month with no contract. Google says it will "be available soon in the largest U.S. markets and will quickly expand to cover more cities across the country." You can sign up at tv.youtube.com to find out when it becomes available in your area. Source: YouTube Blog Tags streaming youtube youtube tv subscribe ...

Hm. tim242 If...it includes Google Music. F4LL0U7 If it did include Google Music, this might be great. No CNN, Comedy Central, or TBS though, that's lame. tim242 I'm sure those will come soon enough. As for CNN, you can get their shows on podcasts. billy routh Why would you want to watch the Fake News anyways? SVem26 Fox news is on there.. you are covered.. :/ tim242 He didn't mention Fox News... billy routh Lol, fox news is fake too but still not as fake as CNN. tim242 CNN has not had any fake news. They have reported nothing more than leaks, that have all been true. I prefer MSNBC. I love Rachel Maddow. Rerun Stubbs You really live in your own little fantasyworld, don't you Timmy...thinking that the Haves are subsidized by the Have Nots.. That makes sense now. Rachel Maddow. So you re in favor of socialism, due to all the success socialist countries have had over the centuries. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman The independent, third-party reviews most definitely found otherwise. Fox News has been consistently found to be the least factual mainstream news source, and its viewers the least well-informed. Waylon Walding Yes cause we all know if they say independent third party. They would never slip there bias in....Bahaha.. who was the independent third party people reviewing this? Lol F4LL0U7 Did somebody mistakenly tell you that if you laugh, the world will laugh with you? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman There have been many. Usually universities. But I'm not basing it purely off of them claiming to be independent. You look at the actual review methodology and results and see how it works out. Anyone who actually believes Fox News is more honest than anyone else is in way too deep. F4LL0U7 I get my fake news straight from Trump's Twitter feed tim242 Hahaha might as well go straight to the source! billy routh Thats because CNN told you that to cover for their own liberal bias F4LL0U7 I really don't need anyone to tell me that Trump spouts nothing but self-aggrandizement, hate-speech, and lies. It's pretty evident to anyone with more than two brain cells to rub together. Waylon Walding Or CNN which ever you look at first? Bahah F4LL0U7 Swing and a miss Midnitte Looks like it doesn't, the Arstechnica article includes some information that it doesn't include ad free from YouTube red so presumably it also doesn't include music. Lame for anyone with red. Artem Russakovskii Which it does not. tim242 That figures. They only threw in the worst part of YTR...the originals. morteum If I can watch NFL games I'm sold. i_say_uuhhh Me too. I currently have Ps Vue which I'm pretty happy with. The only gripe I have is the Horirble and laggy UI/UX across its platforms. Bruce Wayne PS4, PS3 and Fire TV have the best UI experience. Carson Saldanha Does it include YouTube Red and Play Music? Corbin Davenport It includes YouTube Red, there was no mention of Play Music so I assume not. Carson Saldanha Well doesn't YouTube Red include Play Music? So, I'd assume it'd be. Fadakar Yeah when you're paying $9.99. tim242 It doesn't include YouTube Red. It includes YouTube Red Originals, in the TV app. Jonathan Berry I think that is my conclusion as well, after reading it a few times. FourString It's more of the other way around--the Play Music service includes YouTube Red Jonathan Berry It's actually both ways. FourString Touché - longtime Play Music user here so I first saw the feature added from that end lol makapav No it's not. YouTube Red does not include Google Play Music. For e.g. activating YouTube Red on Google Home does not give you Play Music catalog. Jonathan Berry Yes, it does: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6308116?hl=en&ref_topic=6305525 Assuming you have both available. If you pay for one, you get both. tim242 It goes both ways. Jonathan Berry Hmm, or does it? It includes YouTube Red *Originals* in the "new YouTube TV app." So maybe YT Red subscription (no commercials on YouTube) is still separate. :-/ tim242 YouTube Red Originals They did not say if the rest of Red is included. theProffer Corbin, if we have YTR, will it apply over at YT-TV? I imagine it won't because television networks, but I'm just curious. create812 It includes Red, but no mention of Play Music yet. I'd imagine Music will stay separate. tim242 Music and Red are currently together. But it says Red Originals are included in TV...it did not state whether the rest is included. Artem Russakovskii It does not include Red, just Originals. John Bush If they gave subscribers YouTube TV, YouTube Red, and Play Music all for $35 a month for six users, that would be one hell of a deal. Sign me up!! Artem Russakovskii No. Skeptic Spartan It does not include RED or Music. Cakefish Still no Youtube Red for the UK... >_< tim242 Well at least you have adblockers over there : ) Sachin Bahal Or Canada Mix Once this package hits Canada it will have 14 less channels and cost $60, lol. Sachin Bahal YouTube TV probably won't ever come to Canada because Rogers and Bell basically own the rights to everything TV-related but I still don't understand why they haven't launched YouTube Red in Canada yet, I mean we already have the Google Play Music subscription here. Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I use a VPN. =[ Captain_Invisible But you need a US credit card too. Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Didn't matter in my case. Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Worked fine with mine. Captain_Invisible Without a US credit card? Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Banco de Chile" as Bank of Chile. Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes Dan Cross Yeah, but don't we get 10% off films and music on Google Play instead of ad-free YouTube? I know what I'd rather have. Richard Branches Or latin-america... xenotrumpet @XDA How would this compare to something like, say, Dish Network or DirecTV? Maha Rashtrian Cost wise, it is cheaper. Service wise, they are completely different models all-together. AbbyZFresh Direct TV has over 100 channels. tim242 And their quality of streams suck. OligarchyAmbulance And their quality of apps sucks worse. UberCrew I have used the FireTV & Apple TV apps and they both work fine. UberCrew Quality of the streams work perfectly fine for me. tim242 You must be using some kind of magic. Everybody has complained about it, and AT&T even admitted how horrible it has been. UberCrew No I just have a proper setup with everything hard wired. Also my ISP location may have a better route to AT&T servers. Either way the streaming has worked fine for me. So your "Everybody has complained" claim is false. I am sure their has been issues for many people in different areas. Some are due to AT&T's network issues but I have no doubt that many of the complaints are due to people having bad home network setups or poor internet service. destinyhud direct tv is a mess at the moment. not sure about sling UberCrew How is DirecTV a mess? Did you mean DirecTV satellite service or DirecTV Now the streaming service? DirecTV Now the streaming service works perfectly fine for me as far as streaming goes. It just lacks basic features such as DVR, has a limited On-demand library, lacks support for many TV Everywhere apps and does not have an Android TV app. Problem is each of these OTT services is flawed in one way or another. Either they are lacking content, features or both. destinyhud just one of the few rants i have seen online and I have the same issues as well http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/13/14257936/directv-now-errors-complaints-att I was not alone TechGuy22 until they allow people to choose which channel they want or not why the fuck would i need fox news for ? i'll stick to Kodi. TechGuy22 also no cartoon network too expensive A Person Hates Fox and watches cartoons. Checks out. TechGuy22 well i'm not 60. lomsha Nothing wrong with that. grizzlyjon83 Meh. No Viacom channels (not a shock), no Turner channels. Not seeing anything that would pull me away from Sling TV currently. Box Also no Scripps (HGTV, Food, etc) or Discovery channels. Looks like they spent all of their money on sports. TechGuy22 news channel and other crappy channels as well. wtf. Bruce Wayne Money well spent. Most of the Scripps channels are fake reality nonsense. Adam Jones I'm on Sling too. If their lineup catches up.. damn son. I like Sling but I'm not in a local ABC market and don't want to put up an antenna. MJ Agreed, the $25 SlingTV package has a better lineup for me but I would like the cloud DVR. Yaki Forto http://blog.sling.com/announcements/important-update-sling-tv-cloud-dvr-beta-program/ MJ I know someday SlingTV will have cloud DVR but I was talking about NOW. create812 Cloud DVR? I'd they're just recording/saving everything once and serving it back to those who "DVR" it. Much more efficient than every individual recording to their own copies to their own devices! Bruce Wayne It's Google. They have server farms all over the place. Recording a couple of shows is nothing to them. dizel123 Does it matter? Nathan Haines It does not. Nick Felker I imagine they're doing something like that. Each show will probably be a YouTube video under the hood, like they're already doing with Google Play Movies & TV. They'll just give you the correct permissions to view it. UberCrew As long as they don't remove the ability to fast-forward passed commercials. Biggest negative to On-demand content is the inability to skip over most advertisements. PaulW US only I assume?? 😆😄 Time to move to a better country ;) Hunter Hubers Really want to know if this includes Google Play Music. tim242 That's what we all are wondering : ) JSo I doubt it. It just says it includes all YouTube Red Originals. Probably doesn't mean you get the ad free youtube and all the other things as well unless you're paying the $9.99 a month. Which then includes Google Music. makapav It does not include YouTube Red or Play Music. You guys are deluding yourselves in the expectation. It is very clear that this includes YouTube Red Originals. Browningate Deezloader>Google Music, so it's of no concern anymore. Artem Russakovskii It does not. It's pretty clear from the post, but since I was only about 99% sure, I reached out to Google, and now I'm 100% sure. Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I guess anyone except anyone who lives in the US is a second class user AGAIN. Navarr Barnier It's not even going to be available to all of the US. Television licensing is *super hard* legal stuff Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know I know... Only that is frustrating. Licensing for Netflix was hard, TV channels should be harder. Luckily, Cumulus TV works fine. vwbeetlvr Where is AMC? Zach Mauch No Walking Dead for you! Bob How is that series still on... Lost me with 2 seasons spent at the prison. Talk about fluff... Miguel Angel I don't blame you for stopping in the worst season. But give season 3 and beyond a chance. I don't think you'll regret it. Zahir_SMASH I couldn't even get past season 2 Suicide_Note Your loss. Negan is a total badass. Kevin Glassman I am Negan, No, seriously, when did that mullet Eugene become a badass, bedpan stealing SOB... making molten metal covered walkers... bonus points for head armor. Suicide_Note It's all about survival. He has to depend on himself now, and not others. He may be a coward, but Eugene is no dummy. abc Probably because TV channels don't air programs based on your personal preferences. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ On PlayStation Vue John Doe Yeah it's missing Viacom channels as well so I guess Google is negotiating with them. I hate TV networks. They should do what Netflix did and negotiate with Studios. People don't care about live TV anymore except for the News, sporting events and other big events like New years eve and award shows. People care about shows and the actual content not the networks they just bundle shit you don't want to watch and shove it down your throat. AbbyZFresh Disgusting. These channels are barebones and they have the audacity to charge $35 for this? I'll stick with PS Vue. tlogank Disgusting? That's a weird adjective to describe the options. This looks better for me personally, especially giving 6 accounts access. All competition is a good thing, regardless. Zach Mauch Having both ESPN and Fox Sports is the reason for the higher price I would assume. I don't know about PS Vue, but I think the Sling price for both of those is either $30 or $35. Bruce Wayne Vue has ESPN, ESPN 2, FS1 and FS2 in their $30 package. 😆😄 Side by Side comparison to PS Vue? YTTV looks better to me. Steve Jones To each their own but to me Vue is way better. This seems bare bones for 35 bucks. UberCrew For me I would rate these OTT services going just by channel lineup like this. 1: DirecTv Now 2. PS Vue. 3.Sling TV 4. Youtube TV. designdolphin I may have missed it, but any word about whether there will be commercials? tlogank of course, this is regular live tv designdolphin Thanks. So then would the networks like NBC, ABC, CBS, etc. be the local broadcast versions? Rerun Stubbs yes..that is why it is only available in select markets at first. WEll..not totally local. They are likely never going to make deals with LOCAL local networks if you live in a small city that has its own TV. Then you will likely be stuck with the nearest major cities channels. Bruce Wayne It's live TV.... Chris Oh Um...OTA channels for free, Plex DVR? Why am I paying $35 a month? Are we slowly heading back to "cable"? without the cable? zepy3 Not all of us get OTA channels. thespacecowboy Only core channels are usually available OTA. Most others are only via cable, satellite, or streaming Chris Oh still thinks this is too much... Lateef Alabi-Oki Google, let me help you out. - Include ad-free YouTube Red support. - Include Google Play Music Family plan support. - Include Google Assistant/Google Home/Google Cast/Android TV support out of the box. You now have the best live streaming platform on the planet. No competition whatsoever. 😆😄 $35 + $14.99 GPM/YTR (Family-6 users) = $49.99/month destinyhud lol exactly what i was thinking. Dan Lynch Math is hard. Lateef Alabi-Oki Gaddamnit! I didn't even bother doing the calculation in my head. I still don't want to pay for 2 different Google streaming services. fahadayaz Considering that it works out to be less than how much you were willing to pay, why not? 🤔 Lateef Alabi-Oki It doesn't work out to be less if you include taxes. I pay around $16 and some change for YouTube Red and GPM Family. If this package included YouTube Red and GPM family, it'll be a good deal. fahadayaz Ah yeah - good point. I forgot that in the US, the price they advertise isn't necessarily the price that you pay. :/ moosc So you can watch on your mobile device? Corbin Davenport Yep. OligarchyAmbulance Wow, no HGTV? That's one of the few networks *every* streaming service gets. I'm amazed they managed to get live local networks though, Vue is the only other to manage that and it's only for CBS. I may finally switch from Vue for this. Steve Jones That channel lineup is garbage. No TBS, AMC, TNT, Discovery, and more. As a cord cutter the broadcast networks being included is meaningless since I can get those OTA and in HD for free without them using up my data. PSVue seems like a better deal right now. Kevin Glassman with Rick and Morty Season 3 dropping anytime now, you would think they would of tried to get CN, well fanboys will be fanboys, I'm keeping my PS Vue for 35$/month Waylon Walding Not sure how you get all those ESPN channels via rabbit ears? SavageJeep @StevieJones39:disqus Still waiting to DVR over the local channels too! Steve Jones I get those over Vue. The antenna is for the local networks. Lee Interesting but you better make sure you don't blow up your monthly data allowance. I think this route is better because you can select what you want to watch when you want to watch it. We tried Layer3TV over the holidays and it somewhat blew up our data usage. Bruce Wayne PlayStation Vue is still better. You can have up to five users plus you get more channels for the base price of $30. stetsonaw How so, aside from channel lineups? I'm all for the 9 month DVR. Likely a much better mobile experience as well. Bruce Wayne Channel lineup is important. They don't have a lot of the channels I watch but Vue does. Like I said, it's also cheaper and has more simultaneous streams available. Until it debuts, we have no idea what the mobile experience is like so that can't be talked about. I will admit that the nine month DVR is nice as opposed to just one month on Vue. stetsonaw Channel lineup is big for me as well, and until it expands to add everything I want, I'll stick with Vue. I do like that the locals don't add an extra $10 to the bill. And I'm figuring the mobile experience will be better since it will be made by google, and not be as clunky as the Vue app. Bruce Wayne Indeed. This is a start in the right direction. If they can make it as ubiquitous as YouTube, that would be a great thing. Rerun Stubbs How so aside from channel lineups? Well...for a TELEVISION package...lineups are pretty much the MOST IMPORTANT thing for 99.9999999999% of people. 9 months of DVR service doesn't mean a damn thing if it doesn't include the channel you want. UberCrew No $30 PS Vue package here. Youtube TV's channel lineup does suck though. Tom Z Problem is the need for a fast internet connection at home. I tried to watch a movie on Google Movies and it kept buffering. The picture and sound also didn't even come close to DirecTV that I currently have. destinyhud i have never had buffering on play movies. it takes a few seconds extra to start the video but besides that it stream fine. I think its probably your router/provider issue RyRyTheFunBun Sooo, are we gonna get a native YouTube app for Fire TV now? Duder12 Buy an Android TV like the Shield RyRyTheFunBun No stetsonaw Really wish MLB Network would make deals with other streaming services. DirecTV Now is the only option, and no thanks. Hopefully that and AMC get added at some point. Heck, just AMC would probably encourage me to move away from Vue. Dimitri Google has just announced that it will be shutting YouTube TV down after just 23 minutes as part of its Spring Cleaning initiative. All Data will be moved till Google Drive until April 28. Bruce Wayne Lmfao. makapav ...at that point, Google Drive will shut down. theProffer Though, to be serious for a moment, it might be dead soon(TM). Seeing as how net neutrality is probably going to die in this political cycle, and metered WIRED internet connections become common place, expect the real cost of ditching cable providers to be a lot more than $35+internet/month. Donald King I'll keep PlayStation Vue. I get AMC and more channels period for same price Bruce Wayne You mean AMC? XerBlade Well, there are already channels in that infographic that are offered by literally none of the existing streaming TV providers. I'd say they're off to a good start. Bruce Wayne Like? Jay Not the channels I want or need to pull me away from Vue. Damn. It'd have to at the very least match my current channel selection. Willie D They could make it cheaper by ditching ESPN and Disney for those of us who not only don't care for sports, but don't have children. That alone would drop the price by $10 or more, based on other subscription program plans I've seen that trade off channels for these two. Less cost for 10 more channels, or more cost for ESPN and Disney and omitting the other channels is the trade. I'll take more for less please. Also I hope they move all the Red channels to this platform and off the normal platform, I hate all the content, its arrogant, pretentious, and quite honestly, I can only see so many washed up YouTube stars like Joey Graceffa's face clog up my "suggestions" so many times before I wanna cancel totally. tim242 The biggest flaw...too much emphasis on sports. Give us a package without sports, so that we get a better price. Corbin Davenport I would definitely be interested in a non-sports package. billy I understand the lack of interest in sports, but this does provide some added value to sports fans that other services don't. The fact that this potentially includes my local cable sports network (Comcast Sports Net) is a pretty big selling point. None of the other streaming services allow me to watch the local games, only national broadcasts. Bruce Wayne Sports are a big seller and it's the main reason people still stick with live TV. Everything else can be watched on-demand. Sports is generally watched and enjoyed live. tim242 I get that. But offering a non-sports package for much less money would get even more customers. Bruce Wayne Indeed. I'm sure they will roll out additional packages and services as time goes on. duke69111 I disagree. The one thing that kept me from dropping my cable was live sports. This package contains them all with the exception of Turner Networks for March Madness. tim242 You disagree because you like sports. You also like your sports to be subsidized by those of us that don't care for sports. Rerun Stubbs Tim..it is a good thing you have given up trying to lose your virginity. Otherwise, Darwinism would have weeded you out of the gene pool a long time ago. Because even a FIFTH grader would see that your comment is not just hilariously ignorant, but 100% BACKWARDS. Try to use your brain for the first time in your life. Your channel has FAR fewer viewers. The sports channels have LOTS more! So...it is very obvious that it is the sports channels that are subsidizing the virginal crap you watch. IT is just plain common sense. If it was just your channel, they would have to make do with just the subscriber money for like 2 million subscribers. But thanks to everybody that wants ESPN but not your crap, they get to force 560 million people to pay them. In other words, without ESPN, your channel would have to charge 25 times as much per subscriber. So it is time YOU stop sponging off sports fans, you suicidally lonely, self cutting welfare failure. I mean...it is just plain common sense that subsidies happen FROM the more popular to the less popular. tim242 Blocked. Bye. UberCrew The same ESPN that is losing millions, hemorrhaging subscribers and had to fire a bunch of employees. ESPN doesn't even show many games anymore. Most the time it's just a bunch of talking heads who have turned the network into another reality TV crap fest. If you want to watch real sports I wouldn't bother with a has been network like ESPN. SB one down, three across.. did a double take. Steve Freeman What, Free Form? What is it? stetsonaw ABC Family's new name, they rebranded it last year. Steve Freeman Gotcha. I had no idea, thx. Nate Awesome and Google didn't even add CNN they smart we got no room for that very fake news here, even though Google is a bunch of liberals cucks anyway Patrick Smithopolis It's odd they include the channel that started the fake news trend - FOX. Marty Google may be a bunch of liberals, but they are the more rational variety... freshprince_87 That doesn't even make any sense Marty I know. But it's Google...lol tim242 Shut up. Stop making everything political. Go to Breitbart. Patrick Smithopolis And they're not even original. They just parrot what Trump says. They're mindless zombies. Marty Breitbart? Meh, too liberal. Rerun Stubbs Oooh! You sure made Fox News look bad! And you looked SO intelligent! Doby Gillis Oh look the deplorable racists and commie lovers are jizzing in their pants. Marty You got that wrong. You liberals are the commie lovers and racists. You even say it on national news how "white people are what's wrong with America" and white people should not be in charge of the Democratic Party. You liberals are so violent and intolerant that you riot at UC Berekely over a conservative scheduled to talk there. You liberals are against freedom of speech and destroy property, commit violent acts against anyone who disagrees with you. Yeah, you have that wrong. You liberals are the real racists, bigots and commies. You're also fascists. But don't take my word, the airwaves are full of videos showing what you all do. Those videos are forever... tim242 Milo is not a conservative haha. You people are silly. JoeKerr Wonder if they are going to support AndroidTV. The only reason I have Sling is for AMC. destinyhud yes. chromecast is supported and ATV has chromecast built in dizel123 I think he means will it have a dedicated Android TV app. UberCrew No google cast is not the same as a native Android TV app. I don't like using google cast and would rather have an Android TV app. Lazy Tango Lack of AMC and Adult Swim/Cartoon Network is kind of a dealbreaker for me. I'll stick with Sling. Ramon Oh damn. Shit just got real. Marty Heh...not one channel there do I watch. I guess that's why I'm not a braindead liberal out rioting and destroying my friends' property. I haven't been brainwashed or programmed by those channels. MatchstickMan Eh, 2/10 troll attempt... dizel123 You give far too much credit Marty Lol..just 2/10?? tim242 Fox News is on there...troll. Marty Meh...FN is too liberal..lol tim242 The fact that the terms liberal and conservative are being brought up here, means that you need to get some fresh air and separate yourself from cable news for a while. Marty Joke. It was a joke. 😋 tim242 I'm really glad to hear that! I was thinking that you were one of the good guys around here. Marty Sometimes my dry humor rubs the wrong way. 😉 Valery Babanin 8:00 https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f8ddd957979b663d58e03ae5b6197a816041ab389837200e7fca3454453fdcfc.png tim242 What does that mean? destinyhud it means its 8 o clock tim242 I get that. But why does that bear pointing out? destinyhud i was trying to be sarcastic. it could be a reference to Android 8.0 turbooo Typically Google uses that to indicate which Android version the phone in the picture is using. For example 7.1 would read 7:10. tim242 Ahhh. That makes sense. Valery Babanin New Android version Francois Roy Yet another service that will never make it outside the US of A. Fuck Google. If Apple ever attempts something similar, they'll launch in 100 countries on day 1. Doby Gillis Go suck Jobs' dead dick some more. Francois Roy You are a clever man. Mommy's gotta be so proud of you! tim242 You must not understand TV. stetsonaw You do realize that these are US channels, which are typically only shown in the US? I know there are some providers in other countries that work out international deals, but how would you expect something like this (or vue, or sling, or DirecTV Now or...) to be functional in any fashion outside of the US? Francois Roy You do are aware that TV is also a thing outside the US, right?.. Well, believe it or not, we even have our own channels! stetsonaw You are missing my point. If Google is to offer something like this outside the US, it would require licensing with channels available in the country where the service is being offered. Francois Roy Indeed, it would. MY point is that it's exactly what Apple would do. They would never launch a new service in a single country. Rerun Stubbs Apple is not going to DO something like this, idiot. There is a HUGE difference between offering an overpriced product worldwide and making deals with TV networks. Surely even a worthless Frenchman realizes that. Francois Roy Hey pal; 1- I'm Canadian 2- Go fuck yourself Chester Roberts *Cough Cough* Time reads 8:00 on the screenshot on the website... tv.youtube.com/welcome Sexecutive Officer How about Canada though? Francois Roy Google doesn't give a shit about what happens outside USA MatchstickMan Wooo! U!S!A! U!S!A! U!S!A! freshprince_87 I hope this gets cartoon network and boomerang.... Bruce Wayne Boomerang is usually an upper tier channel. Mike O When is Google gonna stop shoving down our throats with that "YouTube Red Originals" nonsense? It's not a perk and no one wants it. Stop adding it to deals. stetsonaw Are ANY of them worth watching? destinyhud mind field is worth watch.. thats one of the few i like. my wife like single by 30. thats pretty much it yann933 Yeah, Mind Field is definitely a good one, gotta love Michael Stevens 👍👌 tlogank not everyone has the same opinion as you, isn't that crazy? Mike O They should. LOL Rerun Stubbs Yeah...but the number of people who bother with it shows that FAR more people have his opinion than yours. It is a failure about on the level of Google+ Glich no food, no cartoon network/adult swim no bbc.. too bad perhaps more will be added later. Vivek Rameses I'm sure they'll come out with a kids package soon. Alex Rusinov No AMC no deal. I need to get my "Walking Dead" fix :) Oliver Ulpts Including Trump propaganda network Fox News Rerun Stubbs Oooh! You sure showed President Trump! Gilberto Aren't half of these channels already free? Gabriel Macys Got enough FOX channels, Google? Are you basing channel selection on the average Youtube commenter? kamiller42 Get over it. Rerun Stubbs Ummm...you DO realize that the Fox channels are the highest rated ones on TV, right? Or did you wave bye bye to reality once you realized that you would never have a life worth living? remi why would you have to wait when it's available in your area? doesn't it work with a dedicated youtube tv app and your mobile or wifi connection? lomsha Maybe because of local channels. tlogank locals iG @fonerin5 Oh god. Kodi will get so much better now.. 🗣🙌🏾👏🏾 Bruce Wayne It would be nice if they got Nick and Nicktoons. Anthony If this was $40 and included Google Music I would be all over this. YouTube Red is beyond worthless to me. tim242 This does not include YouTube Red...only its originals in the TV app. ScottColbert I'll take DirectNow over this, better selection, more channels for the same price. Vivek Rameses Wow, this is going to fail miserably. This makes sling TV look good. b00sted Need AMC and history channel David Nowicki Will it have Comcast sports to watch my Blackhawks win the cup and Cubs repeat. saltynegro As someone who still has YouTube Red and Google Music as a package deal for 9.99, I wonder if getting this will separate the services for my account. That would be unfortunate. :( tim242 YouTube Red is not included in this TV package. They are only including the YouTube Red originals in the TV app. lomsha Missing a lot for now. Ryuuie If Cartoon Network and Nick show up, I'm fuckin' down. Nathan Gonzalez ...Internet rates are going to skyrocket... fahadayaz Well they shouldn't advertise unlimited if they're aren't able to provide such a service. Paul Hansen Comcast and ATT don't advertise unlimited any more in many markets. Limited to 1tb/mo José Gómez The channel listing is pretty compelling. If they add a few more Spanish sports channels such as Deportes Univision, ESPN Deportes, and BEIN ñ (the only sport I care about is soccer) as well as AMC I'll strongly consider it. If they include Play Music, which I already subscribe to, it's almost a no brainer but I need my La Liga, Liga MX and Walking Dead. Hopefully they'll add those channels soon. CDisqusman Chiller - cool! but, no Spongebob or Southpark? Josh Crumley This has huuuuuuge potential. The main thing I hate about the existing online-tv services like sling and ps vue and such is that their native apps usually suck or lag, the interfaces are clunky, and "not everything works just right". Using YouTube as a backbone makes this sound like it will be flawless and stable right out of the box. Now just fix that lineup a bit and include Red/GPM and I'm in. Total Insecurity I am looking forward to Google TV in 2025 in Germany! /s Matthai Meanwhile, in Australia Foxtel: hahahahahaha no. Not permitted here. Ever. Mirad77 Is that 40+ network or channels? Some networks have more than one channels. $35 will be expensive for only 40 channels. PS Vue would be better for the my dollar. nxtiak No Cartoon Network, meh. spearstuff Yeah I need Cartoon Network. That is the main channel I watch. thomasguide2 This is a really lame channel lineup, sling + an antenna will get you a better lineup for less money. Honestly I don't care for local channels they're good for checking weather and sports on local new and not much else. mkc23 Does it include fake news? I need those for doing my thinking for me josh rosales No Turner networks for NCAA March madness. Pass. Browningate It seems like all of these streaming services are always missing a handful of essential channels. I guess it's not time to dump the cable subscription just yet. UberCrew Exactly. PS Vue has great features but is missing too many channels and their pricing is too high here, DirecTV Now has the best channel lineup of all these services but is still missing some plus it is missing important features. Sling TV has a decent channel selection but to get the ones we want we have to keep adding additional packages. At that point the pricing just gets to the point of being similar to traditional cable TV. Youtube TV has very few channels that we care about. At this point none of these services is complete at least as far as the needs of our household go. They just aren't mature enough for us to leave Comcast for any of them yet. Browningate True. Between Vue, SlingTV, and YouTubeTV, most of the channels one could want are available, but it would require the purchase of three expensive subscriptions to have them all, defeating the purpose. They're getting better, but it's just a reminder that these services still aren't ready to replace your cable subscription yet. Rerun Stubbs Have you all not figured out WHY? IT is because a good portion of your cable package is NOT going to the cable company. Over the last 10 years or so, every time a channel has had their contract end, they have demanded HUGE rate increases per subscriber. So obviously, if any streaming service was going to get a comparable package, they would have to charge a comparable amount. Think about it...say there are about 100 million cable/satellite subscribers. A channel that only has maybe 2 million viewers in any given month can charge just 20 cents a month and still get $20 million! Just from subscriber fees. Because all the other subscribers to cable have to pay whether they want to or not. (This is also why idiots who think that the smaller channels are subsidizing ESPN are literally ass backward on reality. It is ESPN fans that are subsidizing the smaller networks.) So now say you have a situation where sorts fans DIDN'T have to subsidize the crappy obscure channel. Now, they would only get 2 million willing to pay for it. But...they still want their $20 million a month to pay for the programming. So now they have to charge $10 a month instead of 20 cents! Which, of course, will make a significant portion of their 2 million fans not subscribe, and they STILL come out behind. The first streaming channel that make deals with LOCAL sports channels, like MSG, YES and SNY in the NY area will win the day. I am a sports fan and I have NO IDEA where ESPN is on my cable lineup. Because like most spots fans, I have absolutely NO desire to sit down and watch some random sporting event between two teams that I don't care about. If the San Diego Padres are playing the Milwaukee Brewers, I am not watching it. UberCrew I know that for most sports fans they couldn't care less about ESPN. I agree most people want to watch their favorite teams so they will want the local networks and local sports channels . For someone like me who is an NFL fan of a non local team and don't care too much about the other sports the local sports networks don't appeal to me. My only option is NFL Sunday ticket or finding a stream somewhere. Not much choice at all. None of the current OTT streaming services can offer everything that I want. Nahuel Any news about this services outside U.S? South america especially? JohnD That list sucks. Fox news but no CNN lol tim242 They don't handpick channels. They have to get partnerships. Give it time. Rerun Stubbs Uhhh..one has LOTS of viewers. The other one has very few. So that choice was obvious if they want to attract more customers. Paco Inurreta Now they need to do it for a day or for a channel. I'd love to watch the SuperBowl, F1 races or any major sport event (if they are going to be in the sport channels above) and watch them legally without using a streaming service. xunknownx is this live TV? so i can watch live sports and stuff? or is it just on demand stuff? dirtmound Without BEIN Sports or a BEIN Sports connect account, I still prefer Fubo.tv EE-EHN No Food Network no buy Anjo Cerdeña Noteworthy: the landing page comes with a new seemingly YouTube-branded typeface: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7e26752687b5565ab9064c07fd3fd4b59700ebed7eb5c85af1bae25ee7230e3f.png adam seymour But does it include you tube red /s Nathan Budd We still don't have YouTube Red or Podcasts in Google Play Music over here in the UK, so I'm not going to hold my breath. In the mean time, I've cancelled my Family play music subscription, and am now using Spotify and Amazon Prime TV. Google needs to get its act together with international releases! JG I would like to see the YouTube Red Originals channel expanded to be more aligned with Netflix and Hulu's Originals. I'm sure Google would have enough money to do a Stranger Things or Man In The High Castle must watch series... Or maybe resurrect/reboot some series... Maybe Firefly for example (though Tudyk has Powerless now and Glass unfortunately is no longer with us) bekifft This seems to be mostly sports channels. Also, when was the last time Google had to release a *web based* feature on a *city by city* basis? I can't wait for these dinosaurs to die. Sir_Brizz It's because they are providing local broadcast stations. Bryan Pizzuti Not a bad start, their local network coverage is impressive, they got all 5 major networks (assuming you consider CW to be "major."). Missing a lot of cable channels though. NFL network, the Scripps channels (and obviously Viacom). Looks like Turner opted out too, no TNT, no CNN. Toys Samurai CW is major, to me. Just when I was about to celebrate that finally a streaming service with CW is available, I found that CNN is missing. Those twos are my brain food. dirtyjudo The CW has it's own app. The shows are free. Sir_Brizz Just watch Fox then. Rerun Stubbs your brain must be pretty skinny. Rerun Stubbs God for no NFL network. They show like EIGHT games a year and the rest of filler. Any game that features a local team must be carried by a local station so it is literally just providing games against teams that most people don't care to watch. And they want over $30 a year per subscriber. You really want to pay $4 to watch a regular season game between the Chargers and Seahawks? JRomeo hmmmm $8 per month for Hulu, or $35 per month for this new tv thing. I think Hulu Wins. Reginald Pierre nah 35$ for directv now with 100+ channels is the real win at the moment. Hulu is truly limited, recently cancelled service. Hoping Google will beef up channel count on this service down the line. Biga173rd 35$ a month GTFOH. Kimmy Gibbler No cartoon network. No deal Timothy Vreeland PlayStation Vue needs to rebrand itself. It blows all of the other competition out of the water, and it works smoothly. I would think having PlayStation in its name is holding it back from people who aren't gamers. I've seen some people think you need a PlayStation, or think it's an add on service for PlayStation Network. Sir_Brizz I would get this with the unlimited DVR and local broadcast stations it is a better deal than anyone else has right now. Hopefully it will come to my area fast (I'm the original Sling.tv area...). Eddy Nelson Lopez I can watch every single one of those channels for free with Kodi 😂😂 Cat Astrophy Weak selection and no bundle with Music and Red. Not for $35 no. Hulu ad-free sub and Netflix COMBINED are cheaper. JG Google says it will "be available soon in the largest U.S. markets and will quickly expand to cover more cities across the country." Do we know how they're defining "soon"? It apparently isn't yet available in San Diego (8th largest city in the US)... I wonder if Google were to drop the local stations [of course that would mean loosing the already ultra small possibility I'd get to see Star Trek Discovery on it totally] and just included the national stations (USA, SyFy, et al) if they could possibly do a nation wide launch. Awhile ago I read an article about Google working on a system to personalize TV ads. Google could use that to inject their own ads, personalized to me. Targeted ads would more likely be more effective in getting me to buy something. And removing all of the localized content could potentially allow Google to get past the whole "you can't show content from out of the area" rule. My phone's GPS would be able to let their system know which time zone I'm in so I can't start watching prime time shows from an East Coast feed at 5pm on the West Coast... Rupam Chakma http://www.TricksFoorti.com UberCrew I have no interest in Youtube TV at $35/mo with that listed channel lineup. It only includes about 6 out of the 20 or so channels that we normally watch. Problem is none of the other OTT services offers all of the programming that we watch either. DirecTV Now comes the closest but their lack of DVR service, which is a must since most On-Demand content contains advertisements that you can't fast-forward over, makes it a non-starter for us. Plus some content is not available On-Demand or it's availability is delayed significantly . Speaking of On-Demand, DirecTV Now's current library is rather sparse while their support for TV Everywhere app logins is also extremely lacking. DirecTV Now still doesn't even offer a native app for Android TV or a Roku channel. So it's either continue to pay Comcast or subscribe to more than one of these OTT services to get most of the content/features that we want. In the end the pricing is not much different and we still end up paying more than we would like.

I only want maybe 5 channels. This is no different than cable packages that force you to pay for channels we don't want. I'll skip this until they offer A-la-cart. Actually, I no longer select channels, rather, I select the shows I want to watch, regardless of channel. Fortunately there are online alternatives that allow me to select what I want to watch and don't force me into the old outdated cable box all or nothing formula. Rerun Stubbs Use your brain for a second. With 100 million subscribers for cable and satellite, a small cable netowrk (and usually the whiners like you are always fans of crap that no one else watches) can charge maybe 50 cents per subscriber and still make SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS a year off just subscriber fees. Even i htey only get like 1.5 million viewers EVERY MONTH. So literally, only 1.5 million POTENTIAL customers at any price. Now. you go to your ala carte and you know that 100 million down to the 1.5 million. But..that channel still wants their $50 million a month. They use that to PRODUCE THE PROGRAMMING, after all. (Along with commercials.) So..would you be willing to pay more than $33 for that ONE channel? Because that is what you would have to do. Even if all 1.5 million people that watch when it costs just 50 cents were willing to pay full price, it would be $33 a month. But in reality, no one would pay that much so they would go out of business. Rerun Stubbs Silly blogs still don't get it. No..this does NOT offer "local sports". Crap like the SEC network does not matter to most people. And until a streaming service makes deals with TRULY local sports channels, it is not an option for sports fans. 99% of sports fans...even football fans don't just mindlessly sit there and watch games between teams they don't care about. They follow specific teams...usually the one closest to where they live. So...until NYers can get MSG, SNY and YES, this is not option for them. Same with all the other regional sports that cover the nearest MLB, NHL, and NBA team. The first streaming site that pounds the pavement and works out deals with regional sports channel will win the day. And only then can the term "cable killer" be used. YouTube TV will be yet another in a long list of projects Google tries for about a year and then forgets about for another 2 years before killing it. fattyboomba I still have to pay 75 dollars a month just for the internet .

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 April 2017 by Military News Collavate Releases Google Machine Learning Based Auto-Translation on Collaboration Workflow for Google Drive (1888PressRelease) April 14, 2017 – San Jose, CA – This update includes website widgets, a fully-functional task master, an auto-translating feature and a new user interface. „Adding Google Machine Learning based translation in our app is just the beginning. We will add more unique AI features to help our users improve their work,” said CEO and product evangelist, Justin Jung. For those needing to build an enterprise portal or incorporate an intranet, the new version release makes incorporating group collaboration easier and more efficient than ever before. Now, users can copy and paste Collavate’s widget codes for workflow and post tools onto websites or Google Sites, and also add other gadgets for Google Calendar, Gmail, and other various features. One of the most notable advances included is Post Translator, an auto-translate feature, powered by Google Cloud Machine Learning technology, lessening language barrier issues that may hinder work productivity. The translation button is located in the right corner of each post, and when clicked, the post will automatically convert the post to the user’s set profile language. Each user can use the auto-translate feature up to 10 times per day. Usage of Collavate Groups has been improved in this new version. To organize a team project with a „to do list” approach, a team member simply fills in the project description on a post, uploads any relevant documents, and invites colleagues to the team project. A notification is automatically sent to each included team member. Once members accept the invitation, full collaboration features are immediately accessible. Deadlines on posts has been added drive effective results-driven work. A deadline date can be assigned for the entire domain, a subgroup, or to individual(s) by clicking the clock icon, which automatically converts deadlines to the correct time zone date and time for each member. The individual(s) are notified of the deadline and are reminded accordingly when approaching the due date. Another improvement is the updated user-friendly interface design to facilitate navigation. Contacts can easily be added to posts by directly typing @ followed by a contact’s name. Contact search suggestions has been greatly improved for the option to quickly select contact(s). Now, there is also the option to upload your own background wallpaper to customize your Home menu. Security features are carried over from the previous version, in addition to a new designated Login page to accommodate future supportage of sign in for Google accounts and non-Google accounts. Now, non-Google users may now set up their administration screen to disable domain sharing for posts. The improved Collavate version is made to be mobile-friendly. An icon web shortcut can be added to appear as an app on your smartphone. Founded in 2014, Collavate, Inc. continues its upward momentum in taking the networking platform to the next level with newly released improvements.

Instead, It Ended Up With A Whopper Of A Problem. World | © 2017 The Washington Post | Hayley Tsukayama, The Washington Post | Updated: April 14, 2017 09:57 IST 72 Shares EMAIL PRINT COMMENTS A Burger King sign in Peoria, Illinois, on Aug. 26, 2014. Burger King successfully ran an alternate version of its advertisement designed to trigger Google Home devices late Wednesday, the company said in an emailed statement Thursday. "Last night, Burger King launched very similar commercials that 100% triggered the smart speaker technology. The commercials aired during Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon," said spokeswoman Dara Schopp. The company altered the ad's audio in such a way that it was able to get around whatever block the Google Home had against the original commercial. Schopp also said that Burger King saw a 300 percent increase in "social conversation" on Twitter as compared to the day before - indicating that, good or bad, the commercial got people talking about the company. Earlier, it was reported a Burger King ad designed to trigger Google's voice-activated Home smart speaker and have the device advertise the Whopper no longer works. The ad, released Wednesday, features an actor dressed as a Burger King employee, who says, "Okay, Google: What is the Whopper burger?" The line is meant to trigger the device to reel off the definition of a Whopper using the first line of the burger's Wikipedia page. (Yes, the Whopper has its own Wikipedia page.) Roughly three hours after the ad launched, the ad stopped working. Google's Home would only light up in response to the commercial's prompt and stay mum (although it will give you the first line of the Wikipedia article if you explicitly request the definition of a "Whopper burger"). The fast-food company confirmed that the ad no longer triggered the speaker, but it said it would still air the ad - and indicated that the ad may start working again. "You'll have to tune in tonight to see if the commercial triggers the Whopper sandwich definition response," said Burger King spokesman Brooke Scher Mogan. Mogan said Burger King saw the ad as an opportunity to "do something exciting with the emerging technology of intelligent personal assistant devices." Google did not respond to requests for comment. A person familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak on the record said the fast-food chain did not consult Google before making the commercial. While commercials - often those about home hubs - have accidentally triggered voice assistants in people's homes before, this seems to be the first time an ad has tried to do it intentionally. Based on comments on the ad's YouTube page, many consumers did not appreciate having their devices hijacked. "When you take over someones phone or tablet and have it do your own remote commands intentionally, you are HACKING," read one comment. Once the ad started gaining attention, Wikipedia users began altering the first line of the article about Burger King's Whopper. These edits included references to the burger as "cancer-causing" and stating that its ingredients include "cyanide." It appears that Burger King itself tried to fix the Wikipedia problem. The first sentence changed to a suspiciously glowing description of the Whopper, authored by user "Fermachado123" - a name that sounds similar to Fernando Machado, Burger King's senior vice president for global brand management. Burger King did not confirm or deny that Machado edited the article. Privacy concerns about voice-activated speakers and the connected home have been on the rise as more companies have introduced these products, putting pressure on the makers of voice-operated security systems and door locks to ensure that their devices can't be triggered by unauthorized voices. The place of advertising on the Google Home and similar products has been thoroughly debated by users as they have become more commonplace. Many users don't want to be spammed with ads delivered by what they consider personal assistants. Google subjected itself to criticism after Home users heard what appeared to be an unprompted plug for Disney's "Beauty and Beast" when the film opened last month. Google said at the time that mentioning the film wasn't meant to be an ad but simply a notice to users about what was timely that day, according to a statement provided to CNET. "We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case," a Google spokesman said.

By Aditya Madanapalle /  14 Apr 2017 , 10:01 #Google Google Earth has sent out a press invite for an 18 April event, with a promise of a major announcement. The event is scheduled four days ahead of Earth Day, on 22 April. Google has promised a “new Google Earth” but has left the exact details of the revamp open to speculation. According to The Next Web, the announcement could be related to an enhanced or more broadly available Virtual Reality experience. Google Earth is already available in VR for the HTC Vive. The application was launched on the Steam store in November 2016. Users can explore the planet as a size shifting giant, fly through cities like a bird, or drop to the streets as a normal human being. There are hand picked destinations with cinematic tours. The entire experience could potentially be available through the web on Google Cardboard, to make the Google Earth VR experience more broadly available. There is a new way to explore the ! Try out Speak to Go with your ️ —a WebVR Experiment https://t.co/03xFVsA9n0 #explore #VirtualReality pic.twitter.com/7bhlbnz4rg — googleearth (@googleearth) April 13, 2017 Google has in fact, already introduced a new way to explore Google Earth, through WebVR. Google introduced a VR hub for experimental content that could be consumed through the web, using Google Cardboard or the keyboard and mouse for navigation. One of these experiences is called “Speak to Go” and allows users to explore the planet through voice commands. A Google Creative Labs project, the source code for the entire experiment is available on GitHub. The WebVR experiences are not yet available on desktop VR headsets such as the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift, but Google does plan to add the functionality in the future. There is no StreetView integration with the Google Earth VR experience for the HTC Vive yet. This is purely speculation, but Google is positioned to add another incredible feature to Google Earth. The Dove nanosatellites being injected into orbit as seen from a camera on board the PSLV-C37. Image: Isro. The PSLV-C37 mission by Isro in mid February this year put into orbit 88 satellites from Planet known as Flock 3p. Combined with the 12 satellites put into orbit on the PSLV-C34 mission in June 2016, the satellites form a “line scanner” constellation that can image the Earth every day. Those logged in to the Planetary Explorer on the Planet web site, can view these daily images. Alphabet Inc, the owner of Google, sold its satellite imaging division Terra Bella, to Planet. The deal included an agreement, according to which, Google would buy satellite imagery from Planet. Google Earth could start making available daily mosaics of the entire planet.

Like using Google’s new phone transfer tool and more. The Pixel is Google’s best smartphone to date, and could be the best Android phone available. Period. It’s that good. Running the latest Android 7.1 Nougat, rocking the best camera in any smartphone, stunning battery life and a premium design. It’s fast, fluid and powerful. Read: 15 Best Google Pixel & Pixel XL Cases Everyone uses their phone different not to mention has different wants, needs or preferences. However, our tips will transfer virtually anything and everything from your old device, including text messages and settings. Then go through some other settings, controls and tips to take advantage of everything this phone offers. Right out of the box the Pixels run amazing. They are fast, easy to use, and just work. During the first startup you’ll be prompted to do some very important things. Like setup a fingerprint for the scanner and lockscreen measure, sign into your account, or transfer from an old device. Google’s Pixel will transfer everything from an old Android smartphone, or the iPhone. Both work with the new transfer tool and the USB-to-USB Type-C dongle that’s included in the box. Don’t lose that, it’s what will make switching to your new phone as easy as possible. Transfer Data From Old Phone The first thing all owners will want to do is transfer data, apps, settings, contacts, calendar, icon placement, photos or video and even text messages to the Pixel. In the past this has been a difficult and painful process. That isn’t the case anymore, and you’ll be able to switch phones 100% in about 10 minutes. Simply follow the steps on the screen or our images provided. Users will need to plug the USB dongle that’s included in the box into the new Pixel phone. Then the USB cable in the box from the Pixel dongle to your old phone. The adapter goes into the new device. This will initiate the transfer service instantly, and do literally all the work for you. Almost everything will be transferred. From everything mentioned above to even alarm pre-sets, text messages, app settings or data and more. It’s the complete transfer package similar to Samsung SmartSwitch. Shown below is the next step, which will tell you what and how much is being transferred, and will let you customize it as well. Clear anything you don’t want to restore to the new device one by one, then hit finish and start the process. Switching my entire Galaxy S7 Edge and over 9GB of data took under 7 minutes. Extremely fast and easy. However, another 5-15 minutes of app downloads and updates will follow, depending on how many apps you have installed. Then the process will keep going and owners can sit and wait, or continue setting up the Pixel while everything transfers. Once it’s finished simply unplug the cable and start using your phone. Google’s transfer tool even restored all my app icons to the homescreen. Convenience at its finest. That’s it in terms of setting up your phone. Not all devices are supported, and some homescreens may not transfer. If so, just reorganize the phone and you’re all set. Setup Lockscreen Security Next up is a step everyone should be familiar with, and is just common sense. Use a lockscreen password, pin, or fingerprint to keep your device safe and secure. The initial setup on the device will prompt you to finish this step, and we’d recommend you do it. Pixel Imprint on the back of the phone is one of the best fingerprint scanners around. It’s located in an easy to tap spot, and setup is a breeze. It only takes about 20 seconds to do. Start by entering a pin, then tap your finger to the sensor six times to register a print. We’d recommend doing both index fingers for the best setup. The entire process is fast, easy and secure. Now your device is ready for use and will be protected from prying eyes or in case of theft. Setup Android Device Manager Speaking of loss or theft, the Android Device Manager is your best friend if this happens. It’s a step almost no one takes, but is extremely easy and will save you when something bad happens. Go to the Google Play Store and download the Android Device Manager. The ADM allows owners to call, lock, or even erase the device if it’s lost, missing, or stolen. It even has an alarm feature to blast the Pixel at full volume if its lost at home. Below is a screenshot of the Android Device Manager on my Nexus 5, but it works the same on all Android smartphones and tablets. This is important in case of loss or theft. It typically can track a smartphone to within a few meters, and give you almost its exact location. Perfect for finding a lost device. Thankfully there’s also an “erase” feature if its stolen, so someone can’t access important information. Alternatively owners can add emergency info or a phone number to call if lost right to the lockscreen. Whether this is medical information, call a family member, or a “call if found” number. Head to Settings > Users > Emergency Info > then add details or a person to contact. Enable and Use Google Assistant Previously known as Google Search or Google Now, the Assistant is one of the key selling points for Pixel. Taking everything Google knows about the web, search, your location, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Then blending that into a personal assistant for every Pixel owner. This is shown during the initial setup as well, or can be accessed by a long-press of the round home button on the bottom middle of the screen. Train it to recognize your voice (even when the screen is off) by saying “Ok, Google” three times. It walks you through setup, then will show you all it has to offer. Tip* Launch the Google Assistant and say “I’m Feeling Lucky” for a neat surprise. It’s better with more than one person, too. Buy Extra Cables, Chargers or Accessories Google’s new Pixel phones don’t use the old and outdated micro-USB port that many old phones have. It uses the new and improved USB Type-C. This is faster, cords can plug in both directions for ease of use, and you can even charge other devices from the Pixel through USB-C. While there are two cables provided in the box, we’d recommend owners pickup a spare for other rooms of the house, or an office. And maybe even some cases and a USB Type-C car charger. Here’s a list of some official Pixel accessories. Get Unlimited Storage and Backups of Photo/Video Google Photos has evolved into one of the best photo and video storage and viewing solutions on mobile. It automatically (or when connected to WiFi) makes a full resolution or HD copy of every picture you take, and is really smart. Ask it to show you photos from last Halloween, and it intelligently finds and shows them to you. One perk of being the first Google Pixel phone is truly unlimited backups in full resolution, rather than resized to HD. Simply open Google Photos, go through the quick setup and enjoy it. There’s also a free subscription to Google Play Music and YouTube Red for all owners, just open Google Music and accept it. Quick Launch the Camera Next up you’ll want to go through and setup everything. Ringtones, call volume, alert sounds and more. However, you’ll also want to get familiar with your new phone. Head to settings and find the option listed as “Moves” and click that. Here it will show owners that a double tap on the power button will instantly launch the world-class 12.3 megapixel camera. This works if you’re in an app, when the screen is off, and everywhere. Google also added some other neat gestures like twisting your wrist to switch to the front camera for selfies, or using the fingerprint scanner to access the notification bar one-handed. Give them a try, enable what you want and enjoy. Setup Do-Not Disturb One of our favorite features is Do-Not-Disturb. Allowing owners to customize the phone to automatically go silent (or on vibrate) at night. Most don’t know it exists, but love it once they figure it out. Go into Settings > Sounds > Do Not Disturb and set some rules or or times. Then the phone does everything for you, keeps the phone silent while you sleep, but still sounds an alarm come morning time. There is an option to block visual things like notifications from waking the screen, or the option to allow exceptions so select contacts can still get through. Like a significant other or kids. Oh, another idea is to setup a feature called “Night Light”. Head into Settings > Display > and select Night Light. This turns the blue LEDs off on the screen at night, and adds a red tint to the display. This prevents eye strain, helps users fall asleep easier, and will make it so the screen isn’t so bright at night. Perfect for laying in bed. Customize it to turn on/off at certain hours of the day, or with the sunrise and sunset. I love this feature. Studies have shown this helps people fall asleep faster at night. Setup Android Pay While we’re at it, we’d recommend owners setup Android Pay as well. It works just like Apple Pay, and allows you to swipe your phone to make payments while out and about instead of carrying a wallet. Anywhere that Tap-N-Pay is supported will work with Android Pay. Find the icon, launch the app, add a credit card and start enjoying mobile payments. Use App Icon Shortcuts One of the best features in Android 7.1 Nougat that debuted on the Pixel is Launcher shortcuts. It works similar to the iPhone and 3DTouch, and allows specific actions and tasks to be done easier. Rather than just pressing the camera icon on your homescreen or app tray, press and hold. You’ll instantly get suggestions to launch the camera and instantly start recording video, or take a selfie. Instead of opening the camera and switching to these options. App shortcuts are brand new to Android and only work with select Google apps for now, but more developers will fully supported this in the near future. Try it with the messaging app, dialer, maps, Google Music, calendar, Google Keep, clock or alarms and much more. Allowing Pixel owners to do and get more done faster. You can even add all these shortcuts to a folder on your homescreen. Other Thoughts Of course everyone is a little different, and most owners will setup the Pixel to fit their own needs. Our steps above will set you up for success, secure the device, help you find a lost Pixel and teach you a few things about the phone all at once. We’d also recommend buyers pickup a Pixel screen protector, download a bunch of their favorite apps, and explore the settings menu for everything else. If you have any questions there’s a dedicated 24/7 customer support and help line in settings. Swipe to the right and instantly call, email, or even chat with a customer support representative. A few other ideas are to set mobile data limits, test out how great the camera is, customize the notification bar by moving icons around as you see fit, or change your wallpaper to one of the many awesome new choices pre-installed on the phone. You’re all set now, so enjoy the Google Pixel. 3 Responses 10/20/2016 Q Reply Am I missing something, you said that there was a dongle and a cable that was included. I only have USB-C cables and none of my micro USB cables from my old phone seem to be working for this. 10/22/2016 Laura B. Reply I just transferred from a Nexus 5 to the new Pixel yesterday. I used my charging cable for the Nexus 5 (microUSB-USB) and put the USB-USBc adapter on it. Plugged the microUSB end into the Nexus and the adapter end into the Pixel. At one point the Nexus rebooted and I had to start over, but it didn’t take too long and was (relatively) simple. 04/13/2017 Kevin Witmyer Reply Note that the 3 month free music offer is for new subscribers only.

They're Google's attempt to define itself as a hardware manufacturer worthy of comparison not just to Apple's iPhone, but the very products its Android operating system has allowed to flourish over the past eight years. Or, as the refrain goes: Google is finally going to compete with other smartphone manufacturers. This narrative can get in the way of discussing the Pixel for what it is (a smartphone), so I'll try to avoid confusing what this phone means to Google as a company and what it means to you as a consumer. I've been using the Pixel XL for five days. I specify this because as this review goes live, so will dozens of others. Almost all of these people have been using the phone for more or less the same amount of time, and the vast majority of impressions you read from blogs and news outlets today will be based upon five or fewer days with the phones. I am going to keep thoughts on certain items - battery life and general performance, for example - a bit more concise because of this. It's hard to know confidently just how good the battery life is for me yet. It's also hard to know how much the phone will slow down over time. So I don't want to leave anyone with the impression that this review is the end-all, be-all of our thoughts on the Pixel phones, nor to suggest that our impressions are definitive and supported by the week or two we typically afford to the review process. Thoughts are still evolving. That said, we did want to provide this review at the time Google allowed us to publish it, and I hope that this disclaimer gives you some transparency into that whole process. With the pleasantries and meta-discussion out of the way, let's get to what you're actually here for: the phones. Are they good? Great? The greatest? Has Google whipped up a smartphone that transcends a mere list of specifications and a software version? Well, no phone really, truly does, and setting the bar quite so high is to prime yourself for disappointment. But the Google Pixel is a great smartphone - I am convinced. Does its battery last the longest? No. Is its screen the best? Not likely. Is it the fastest smartphone on the planet? Eh, no (sorry, Apple still wins that battle). Is the Google Assistant as life-changingly intelligent as Google seems so amped for us to believe? Hardly. In fact, it is almost obscenely easy to pick apart Google's phone - one might even say pixel by pixel - because it clearly doesn't afford itself of every bleeding-edge technology or feature it could have. The Pixel lacks waterproofing. The rear camera doesn't use optical image stabilization. The batteries aren't unusually large. There's no microSD slot. The processor, while it is the best part Qualcomm has on offer, isn't really much better than the existing Snapdragon 820. Motorola builds phones that charge more quickly, Samsung makes phones with more features and better components, Xiaomi's phones offer far more value for money, and LG's phones probably do something better but I'm struggling on that one at the moment. What does the Pixel offer that is so special? Well, some of you will want to see me hang for this line, but: it just works. Need to switch to a new carrier? That's not a problem - the Pixel supports all four US providers, plus Project Fi. Take a lot of photos? Google will store all of them in the cloud at full resolution, for free (and the Pixel will automatically delete old photos when on-device storage nears capacity). There's no bloatware. Live remote support is built into the phone. Say "OK Google" at any time, even with the display off, and Assistant stirs to life. Break your phone? Google offers - in the US - accidental damage protection. Can't decide precisely which moment you want to photograph? Burst shot makes the call for you. Tired of shaky-hand video? Google's electronic stabilization is the real deal. Questions remain, though. Why is the Pixel commanding such an exceptional premium over last year's Nexus devices? Does the Pixel really do anything those phones don't, or will soon be able to? Can Google really claim to be a competitor on the level of Apple and Samsung? The answers here aren't so clean-cut. (Note: This review will refer to the Pixel as a single phone in many places for the sake of brevity and my own sanity. While there are two versions, with the screen and battery being the only differences, they are essentially one phone in two sizes. Even Google's retail boxes for them are the same. Constantly having to refer to the Pixel and Pixel XL would become tiresome and pointless. When the two devices diverge in experience or aspect, I will be clear about which I am discussing.) The Good Camera This may be the best smartphone camera ever. It's not just the quality of the photos, but the experience - this camera is so fast. Battery life So far, I'd say the Pixel XL has offered battery life basically comparable to the Snapdragon version of Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge, which is very respectable indeed. Google's Android and perks Well, it's a good thing in my opinion. No bloatware, the latest version of Android, and some Pixel-exclusive (for now) features like Google Assistant, Smart Storage, unlimited full resolution Photos cloud storage, and more. Speed The Pixel is a very quick phone indeed. While it probably won't be running laps around an iPhone 7, it's consistently snappy and responsive in a way some phones this year have struggled to manage. Four carriers Google's new phone is SIM unlocked and works on all four major US carriers, and you won't get the runaround from Verizon, either - this is a true four-carrier device. The Not So Good Price There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL. Speaker While not without its merits, the single bottom-firing speaker is a definite downgrade from last year's Nexus 6P. Non-expandable storage Yeah, we know, Google - you don't like microSD cards on phones. The Pixel was a chance to make a clean break on this stance, but no such luck. No ruggedizing The iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 are IP67 and IP68 certified, respectively. The Pixel is IP53, which is basically to say it has no real water-resistance. A bit dull This one is personal, but I just can't get excited about the way the Pixel looks. In Very silver, it's a kitchen appliance. In Really blue, it's an aluminum blueberry. In Quite black it's at least inoffensive... to the point of boredom. This phone's design just feels too "playing it safe." Design and materials Historically, Google's Nexus phones have always been a bit of a toss-up in regard to their actual look and feel. The Nexus 5 looked great, but its plastic frame was unashamedly cheap and things like the power and volume keys seemed to reflect that. The Nexus 6 was an awkwardly upsized Moto X - I don't think much more needs to be said about that. Even the Nexus 6P, often considered by fans to be unimpeachable, simply isn't all that cohesive and coherent. Its cyclopian glass cover for the camera and various antennas was divisive at best. And while it was the first all-metal Nexus, it did feature a plastic piece on the rear "chin" area of the phone that seemed to say "we did what we could with what we had." Not to mention that its smaller sibling, the 5X, looked completely different. The Pixel and Pixel XL feel like solid bricks of aluminum (if lighter). The antenna bands are barely able to be felt. The glass window on the rear transitions smoothly into the metal frame. Does the Pixel have the almost bizarrely perfect tolerances of Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge? No. But the Pixel is clearly a cut above any Nexus in the highly unscientific "how expensive does that smartphone feel" test. Sitting on the right edge of the phone, the buttons for power and volume are responsive and exceptionally clicky (even better than Samsung's, in my informed button-feel opinion). The USB-C port is bottom-center, and the headphone jack is up at the top-left. The fingerprint scanner, the same model as last year's Nexuses, is on the back. The look of the Quite black finish is uniform, with a slightly smoother texture than the 6P. Everything just looks like it's supposed to fit together here. I find the silver and white version gels considerably less well. If you're going to put up with a white surround on the front of the phone, the slightly absurd but fun Really blue color is the way to go (sadly, Google did not provide a blue unit to us). The 2.5D display glass surround gives the Pixel a gentle accent on an otherwise sparse front panel. Apart from the front-facing camera and the occasionally-visible sensor window below the earpiece speaker, there's not much that stands out. Go around back, and there's nothing too loud happening, either, at least on the dark finish. The "G" logo is the only branding on the exterior of the phone, and it's not even all that prominent. Lacking a camera hump on the rear, the Pixel really is a minimalist phone design. Frankly, for what praise I can give to Google on the look and feel of quality (seriously, screw camera humps), I can't award much for actual appearance. At its best, in the black finish, the Pixel looks vaguely generic. I realize the Pixel team has been all about relatively stealthy, sleek designs, but nothing about the Pixel to me really makes it look or feel related to the Chromebook Pixel or Pixel C. At best, I'd say Google has made a phone that won't have the issue of creating design baggage for a successor device. I suppose the Pixel is uninteresting to look at in the way a 1990s Lexus is uninteresting to look at. It's boring because it's supposed to seem grown up. But the more I look at it, the more I use it, the more I feel that Google was deliberately inoffensive with its industrial design here, and I'm really not sure that was a great decision in a market where making a product stand out has become increasingly difficult. The Pixel is a phone that seems to say "You're just going to put a case on me anyway, why should I dress up for the occasion?" And with Google's new flashy artist live cases, that could well be a point. I don't think it means the phone has to be quite so drab, though. Display The Pixel XL's 5.5" Quad HD Super AMOLED display is excellent. It offers adequate brightness outdoors, the superb viewing angles we've come to expect of AMOLED displays, and vivid contrast. Google also hasn't tuned the display to rigid color accuracy, instead seeming to end up somewhere between the typical oversaturation of, say, Samsung, and the highly-calibrated iPhone. Comparing to a Galaxy S7 edge in the "basic" mode, which is exceptionally accurate, the Pixel XL clearly provides more saturation of colors to give them the "pop" factor that most other OEMs using AMOLED displays do. On the one hand, the extra saturation provides the perception of more contrast, which can be important for things like video, gaming, and virtual reality. On the other, for a phone so focused on providing an excellent camera experience, I always feel like I should be seeing the photos I take as accurately as possible so that I can better judge how they'll look not on my screen, but on everyone else's (read: iPhones). But this is an admittedly fringe concern, and one that simply won't bother most people. As calibrated out of the box, it's not as though the Pixel XL looks like Samsung's almost comically bright setup. It's just adding a bit of drama. There's an sRGB mode in developer settings if you want to use that, and it offers a far truer white point and colors, though you'll probably find it a bit dull if you're used to typical AMOLED displays. But if you want to be serious about your smartphone photography, it's an excellent toggle to have. Unfortunately, I sent our 5" Pixel off for a video review the moment I received it, so I couldn't compare the displays of the two. I would assume a similar calibration and character, though the fact that the smaller phone's screen has a lower resolution could mean there's more variance between the parts than normal. On the whole, though, the Pixel XL offers an excellent display, if not one that's going to have Samsung looking over its shoulder. After all, they probably make it. Battery The section you may have jumped to immediately is, I am afraid, going to leave you feeling unsatisfied. I have only used the Pixel XL, and while I would say the battery life has been solid overall, it's also been a bit unpredictable at times. But after the first two days, which I am ignoring out of hand (I find Android needs a day or two to "settle in" on a fresh install), things have been pretty good. You're looking for screen-on time figures, and we'll get there, but first: please remember that these apply to the way I use my phone. Not necessarily, or even probably, the way you use yours. I'm not trying to extract the very maximum screen-on figure, nor do I leave my phone's display on, idle, sitting next to me. Sometimes I'm on Wi-Fi (reducing power consumption), sometimes I'm not. I also have rather annoyingly poor AT&T reception in my apartment which can cause the mobile network to scan much more frequently if a phone is in my pocket. On average, I'm seeing between four and five hours of screen on time with the Pixel XL. If I were to be on Wi-Fi in my office all day, I could probably manage six without much trouble, too. I would say this is comparable to what I typically get with the Galaxy S7 edge (SD820 version), a device that has been lauded for its battery life. As such, I'm actually pretty happy with the Pixel XL in this regard. ... That all considered, I'm going to say my thoughts here have plenty of evolving to do. I'm on day six here - barely (as I write this, day five). I just don't have the data points yet to really say confidently that the Pixel XL provides good battery life, just the initial impression that it does. We'll put a pin in this and return later. As for the battery life of the 5" Pixel, I haven't used it, and can't really offer you anything there. Storage, wireless, and reception The Pixel is the first smartphone from Google to utilize UFS 2.0 storage, meaning substantially faster speeds than the eMMC chips of years past. How fast is that storage? Well, our favored storage benchmark appears to be having some bugs with Android 7.1 and is yielding very strange results - some weirdly fast, some oddly slow - and for now I'm going to forego publishing figures. (Of note: this was an issue with 6.0 last year, too.) But this is a Samsung storage part and I would strongly assume that it is very fast, because the Pixel feels quite fast, and operations like app installs and photo capture feel exceptionally quick, as well. As you know, the Pixel is available in either 32 or 128GB storage models, and I'm actually OK with that. Many people have bemoaned the lack of a 64GB model, but I think the real complaint is that the 128GB model costs $100 more than the 32GB, not that there is some missing storage "sweet spot" here. Out of the box, a little over 24GB of storage is available on the 32GB model. By the time I loaded up all of my apps and signed in to everything, that number was around 18GB. Needless to say, you know what your storage needs are better than I do - the 32GB Pixel is plenty for me, but it may be woefully inadequate for others. If you're the kind of person who rapidly fills up your device's storage with photos, though, that ceiling may not be a worry - Google's new Smart Storage feature will automatically delete local copies of photos and videos taken on your phone that are more than 90 days old when your local storage starts to run low. It will only delete photos and videos that have copies in the cloud on Google Photos, of course. On the wireless front, the Pixel has the standard array of features you'd expect of a modern smartphone - Wi-Fi ac support, Bluetooth 4.2, a host of LTE bands (four-carrier compatible in the US), and NFC. The real question is whether or not any of them have posed any issues during my testing, at least for me. I will say that mobile data has been stellar, even in my AT&T-deficient apartment. The Pixel gets better reception than most phones I test on AT&T, actually. My AT&T-branded Nexus 6 will miss about half my calls if it's just sitting on my desk - the Pixel misses none, and only loses reception if I put it in my pocket. It seems Google and HTC did their homework here. Bluetooth, too, has worked very well for me. Pairing to my car was exceptionally quick, and I've not had any issues with it at all (unlike last year's Nexuses), though I will say the range doesn't seem fantastic, as streamed audio will cut out if I put my phone in my pocket instead of the cup holder. Wi-Fi is where I've had hiccups. My router's signal is poor in many areas of my apartment, often causing devices to flip between the 2.4 and 5GHz networks. The Pixel has had significant trouble with this at times, forcing me to manually toggle the Wi-Fi on a number of occasions to get it to reacquire a reliable connection. There's also a visual bug that correlates with this issue - my quick settings interface will show I'm connected to one network, but when I go into settings, it says I'm connected to the other one. It's an annoyance, but if my Wi-Fi reception wasn't so crappy I doubt it'd be an issue in the first place. Speaking of Wi-Fi, like the Nexuses now have, the Pixel supports Google's Wi-Fi Assistant to automatically secure connections to networks that may pose privacy concerns. It's nice to have. Call quality has been quite good - the Pixel's earpiece speaker is actually one of the best I've used, and even non-HD voice calls have surprisingly decent clarity. The earpiece speaker is loud without being shrill, so I think that helps, too. Audio and speakers The Pixel's headphone amplifier is reasonably powerful, though I did find it's not quite as potent as the one on Samsung's Galaxy S7. Testing with a number of pairs of headphones, I found the audio quality excellent and never saw a need to crank the volume beyond 65-70% or so. I'll be flying in the next couple of days, so I'll get some more experience with how the output of the headphone jack does in loud ambient conditions. As to the single, bottom-firing speaker? Well, it's not going to magically sprout into a front-facing stereo array, nor is it going to convince anyone that there was a worthy tradeoff made here. The quality of the speaker is actually quite good, I'd say it sounds more natural and full than those on devices like the Galaxy S7 and Moto Z (sorry, I don't have a 6P to compare to). But its output is noticeably lower, and it's no substitute for two speakers that actually face... your face. Google did a good job given the design directive here, but beyond that, it's nothing to write home about. As to that second, speaker-grille-looking thing on the bottom? It's just an oversized inlet for the microphone so that the phone looks symmetrical. Nothing to see here. Camera Google did it. In my opinion, the Pixel is the best smartphone camera on the market. It's not just the quality of photos, it's everything that makes the camera so capable and simple. To start, it's incredibly fast - just as fast as Samsung's world-beating S7 camera to launch, but even faster when actually shooting. You can fire off five or six photos in a row without skipping a beat, something that will cause most other smartphones to choke and stutter on buffer. Granted, after those five or six, the phone does need a few seconds to collect itself - but it gets those shots every time. I've simply never used a smartphone camera that is this fast. That's not to even speak of Google's Smartburst mode, which automatically picks the best shots in a rapid-fire capture initiated by holding down the shutter button. While not as reliable on focus as Samsung's crazy-fast dual pixel AF, or as able to draw out light in extremely dark conditions, the Pixel makes up for these technical shortcomings with a host of practical advantages and photo quality that, to me, feels the most natural and realistic of any smartphone this year. The level of detail the Pixel can capture in a macro shot is incredible - the kind of thing that I'd only previously associated with the iPhone. In well-lit conditions, photos are incredibly crisp and detailed, without the over-processed, punchy look that can render a photo worthless at anything beyond a full-width square crop. This is so much more important than I think people tend to realize. Reframing a photo can completely change its character, and when your smartphone is doing all kinds of crazy edge contrast to make photos look "crisp" and colorful, things can look a lot messier when you really zoom in. The Pixel is an absolute cut above the competition in this regard, and as someone who does occasionally photograph things as an activity, I feel I can rely on it not just to capture a scene, but to allow me to manipulate it after the fact. Say what you will about manual controls, but this feels like a photographer's smartphone camera. You can capture candid moments with the exceptionally quick launch, use Smartburst to make sure you get the right shot, and let Google's brilliant HDR+ worry about the exposure and contrast. Google does offer an exposure value slider (handy) as well as white balance modes, too. You can even lock the focus by long-pressing on the viewfinder. In the dark, the Pixel still performs well, though it doesn't quite have the magic trick level of light gathering that Samsung's phone does (I mention the S7 because it was my previous smartphone camera pick). Though, the S7 tends to seemingly create light where there is none at all, while the Pixel is just very good at making use of the light that is available. So, the Pixel may not offer world-beating autofocus speeds (it's a bit wonky at times, actually - hopefully it will get better), have the widest aperture lens, or use two sensors in tandem, but I firmly believe it offers the best overall camera experience on any smartphone, full stop. As for Google's touted video stabilization? It definitely works. I didn't have any extreme circumstances under which to test it, but for just holding your phone and walking around shooting video, it makes a huge difference. I mean, I doubt you'd think I was using a gimbal, but it's still very smooth. And up to this point in the camera section, do you know what all of the samples share in common? They're all heavily cropped versions of much larger photos. Here are the originals of the four I've shown you. And now, for the larger sample gallery (some images here have been cropped as well). Previous Next Finally, let's talk about the electronic image stabilization. It works! I have a video sample, shot in 4K, below, to demonstrate it. It does give video a slightly jarring panning effect if you're too subtle with your movement, but overall? For something shot with one hand over my head, this is incredibly smooth. Performance Is the Pixel fast? Yes. But it isn't going to change your definition of phone speed forever. I'd say the Pixel is roughly as fast as a Moto Z, which is a Very Fast Phone indeed - probably in the top three quickest Android phones currently out there. The Pixel feels very responsive, but I tend to think all of Google's "we can't talk about it, but we did things to make this phone fast, evil, terrible things" was a lot of huff and puff. It gets predictably decent scores in Octane. It gets predictably decent scores in pretty much any benchmark. But they're exactly what you'd expect of a Snapdragon 820 phone - they don't tell a story, they don't give you any actionable information. I can still make enough touch inputs that the animations start to lag behind my finger, and there's still a stutter when you open up the don't-call-it-Google-Now pane in the launcher, and the settings app sometimes takes a second to catch its breath and populate the menu list when you start it up. Where the Pixel has shined for me so far is in the consistency of its performance. Yes, in a side by side app load test, you might see many phones basically keep up with the Pixel. But it's that one time you go to bring up Maps and it's out of memory on your Galaxy S7 and it takes like 10 seconds to load up but you really need to get directions somewhere because you're stopped at a light and you have to decide if you're going left or right ahead. When it's crunch time, the Pixel always seems to maintain its composure and get you where need to go. In short? It feels a bit more like an iPhone. That's not to say I think the Pixel is as fast as the new iPhone - it probably isn't, by virtue of silicon alone. Whether this performance manages to remain consistent over the coming weeks and months will be the much bigger question, and it's one I just can't answer now. Software You know what Android 7.0 is all about - I'm not going to re-review it here, because that would be silly. But Android 7.1 and the various Pixel-exclusive features are definitely worth taking a look at, so let's break them down. Google Assistant Do you use Google voice queries or commands? No? Then you're probably never going to use Assistant, either, unless you have a deep and unrequited love of chatbots. Google talks a big game on Assistant, but the reality is that we've already had everything Assistant can do embedded in the Google app for a long time now. Assistant just gives us a new conversational interface and some slightly more human dialogue on occasion. That demo on stage where the presenter made a dinner reservation with only their voice? Well, it can do that... with a limited number of restaurants that basically cannot be discovered in any easy way. It might support more places in the future, perhaps even probably will, but who knows when? This is the problem any time Google unveils a major new software product: we're given the dog and pony show with all the grand possibilities and then... we wait. I appreciate what Google is trying to do here. Really, I do. I think the potential of Assistant is amazing. But the experience right now is... not. It's just Google's intelligent search results with a more streamlined interface. Can you reserve a table for dinner with Assistant? Yes... if Google Maps knows it supports Open Table, and not all that many restaurants in Los Angeles presently do, meaning I would never book a table this way in the first place - I'd just go on the web. Can you buy movie tickets? No such luck - I can get showtimes with links to click to start the checkout process, but not actually automate the activity beyond that. What about something easy, like ordering a Lyft? Nope... even though that's literally functionality built into the Google Maps app. And I'm not saying Assistant has to do all of this right out of the gate - it doesn't! It's just that the current Assistant experience simply isn't as intelligent or powerful as Google wanted us all to believe when it got on stage and talked about it like it was ready to change the world. Maybe it will be ready in a few years. Right now, we've got a skeletal version - a promising blueprint. But sorry, this isn't going to sell phones, not as it works now. Is it better than Siri? Sure. But so were the standard Google voice queries and commands we've had for years. That's not new. It's always a bitter pill to see Google paint us this picture of an amazingly useful product and then give us... not that thing. But if we've learned anything over the years, this is just how Google works. Assistant will evolve, it will get better, and eventually, maybe we'll all be using it. As is, Assistant is an easy way to do voice queries and commands, especially given it can be launched by long-pressing the home button. If you're tired of "OK Google"-ing every time you want to set a timer or an alarm, relief has arrived. That's a neat feature, but it says something that I think that's about the coolest thing Assistant does right now. Launcher shortcuts Launcher shortcuts are to Android as 3D touch shortcuts are to iOS. That's really the deal here, except launcher shortcuts are slightly more narrow in scope. To activate launcher shortcuts, just long-press on an icon on a homescreen or in the app drawer. If the app has shortcuts, they'll appear. A bunch of Google apps already have them, though their usefulness is of varying degrees (Photos has an "I'm feeling lucky" shortcut - talk about a potentially risky click). So, you ask, how do you tell between the action to pull up launcher shortcuts versus move an icon? And the answer is you don't. It's the same thing. Yep, this is a a bit odd. Launcher shortcuts will immediately pop up when you long-press an icon, to move it, you then have to drag beyond a certain threshold, after which the shortcuts will hide away. It's really weird, because you end up getting two vibration feedbacks, which always makes me think for a moment that something has gone wrong. I can't say this implementation is exactly ideal, and it's almost certainly going to confuse a few people who will think they've done something other than try to move their icons by long-pressing them. Anyway, here are a few examples of the shortcuts. YouTube: Trending, subscriptions, search Settings: Battery, Data usage, Wi-Fi Play Music: Recent activity, My library, I'm feeling lucky Calendar: New reminder, New event Play Store: My apps Photos: I'm feeling lucky, Free up space I'm still not 100% sure how to feel about launcher shortcuts. On the one hand, I love that Google is looking into more power user style device tools, things that can speed up common activities and tasks. On the other? This feels slightly clumsy as implemented. Maybe a gesture would have made more sense here? I don't know. I am definitely curious to see how many apps implement this feature, though, as it's part of Android 7.1 and can be used by any launcher via an API. Enhanced backup This one actually has flown under the radar, and I'm not sure why. The Google Pixels automatically back up your apps, app data, contacts, SMS (!), Wi-Fi passwords, call history, and various settings in Google Drive. Now, Android has done some of this for years. Contacts in your Google account, for example, are old hat. But SMS is new, and automatic app data backup in Drive is still fairly low on adoption, so hopefully this "all in one" backup being advertised as a Pixel feature will get developers to utilize it more. But the big idea here is that Google wants you to have an iPhone-like experience when you set up your next Pixel a year or two from now - everything should just come over. Whether it will work that well in practice, we'll have to see. I did not test the new cabled restore system on the Pixel, but Google seems pretty psyched about it, especially since it works with iPhones. I'd be curious myself to see how that experience would be. Moves (gestures) Android's settings app has a new menu, and it's called Moves. Moves currently is home to three features: double-tap power to launch the camera, double-twist while in the camera to switch between the front and rear facing sensors, and the ability to swipe down on the fingerprint scanner to access your notification shade. They all work! There's not much else to be said. The swipe-down gesture on the fingerprint scanner can be initiated a second time to bring up the quick settings interface, and swiping down will hide the tray again. Honestly, it's not terribly responsive and can be difficult to get to work reliably sometimes. I never was a fan of this feature on Huawei devices for the same reason - it just feels a bit gimmicky. But it's there if you want it. Night light Night light is a simple feature you've probably seen on other phones already - it lowers the brightness of the screen's blue pixels to reduce eye strain in low light, supposedly reducing the chance the display will stop you from falling asleep when you should. You can turn it on at any time, as well as set a schedule or use Google's sunrise and sunset data to engage it automatically. I find the sunset timing less than ideal, since I don't go to sleep around sunset, so I use the custom schedule. There are no options to adjust the intensity of the effect. Wallpapers Holy crap there are a ton of new wallpapers on the Pixels, including a bunch of new live wallpapers. Live earth wallpapers are 3D renderings of famous landmarks that shift perspective when you unlock your device or swipe between homescreens. I hope to see even more of these published as time goes on, because they're awesome. Live data wallpapers either correspond to your battery level, the time of day, or weather conditions - they're very stark and abstract. I love everything about this, it really gives you some interesting new ways to personalize your device. This is in addition to literally dozens of new static wallpapers that you can have change daily, with categories like landscapes, cityscapes, life, earth, and textures. I love that Google is using things like 500px and its own social network, Google+, to source the images, too. That means the potential for a lifetime of beautifully curated wallpapers. Sure, there are great apps for this as well, but a lot of people never discover them. It's just one of those little things I appreciate. OS look and feel, Pixel launcher, Nougat generally Many of us have been using Nougat for months now, and we know what it entails. There are few things that the Pixel phones bring to the software equation that aren't available right now on a Nexus 6P, and those it does are covered in detail above (seriously, you are not missing out on Assistant - Pixel owners are Google's beta testers). One thing that won't be coming that we haven't discussed, though, is the overall aesthetic of the Pixel's software. Google has updated the entire look and feel of the device setup, given many items in the system UI blue accents, and changed the navigation keys - they're solid, with a concentric circle around the home button. When you tap the home button, four little colored dots fly out briefly, with a long press causing them to fully extend and activate the Assistant. There is also the Pixel launcher, leaked extensively in the last couple of months. The Pixel launcher is basically just the Google Now launcher with that weird pill-shaped "G" button to bring up the search box and a date and weather widget (it no longer displays time redundantly). Oh, and some round icons, but they're not mandatory (thankfully). Anyway, if you know the Google Now launcher, you know the Pixel launcher. There are no new settings to tweak, it really is just a light re-skin. What we're seeing here, though, is much more important in a wider context: Google is making an Android skin. A skin that, presumably, it will not share with anyone else. I will watch with great interest as Google's Pixel skin evolves and changes over time, and what makes it into stock Android versus what remains exclusive to the Pixel devices. And because I didn't know where else to put it: Google added a reboot button. Yay. Stability At this time, aside from the Wi-Fi issue I mentioned above, I have one bug to report: "OK Google" always-on listening sometimes stops working, and the only remedy is to reboot the device. The phone is stable and works as expected. Of course, given how long I've been using it, it's very possible issues may arise - things I just haven't noticed yet. For now, though, it's smooth sailing. Value I've decided to add this category to our phone reviews, at least for the time being, because I think value is a discussion worth having in its own right, not merely as a fulcrum upon which to balance an entire review. It can make having conversations about a product's merits difficult, and make it too easy to dismiss some products on what really is a single facet alone. So, how does the Pixel stack up on value? We're going to be judging this on the basis of prices in the United States, as we are a US-based blog with a largely American audience. The Pixel line is priced exactly as the iPhone 7 is. You start at $649 for the smaller, 32GB variant, and the larger 128GB variant goes up to $869. Google lacks a 256GB SKU, so technically it's not an exact match, but for the models Google does sell, it really is a mirror image. Is a Google Pixel worth iPhone money? I think if you contend that an iPhone is worth $649, then yes: the Google Pixel is absolutely worth that. But many people vehemently disagree with that premise. If you take the Google Pixel merely as the sum of its parts and put up the $769 Pixel XL against the $499 Nexus 6P, are you going to find nearly $300 of extra "value" there? I mean, no. You're not. That's like taking a $40,000 Mustang GT and comparing it to a $100,000 Porsche 911. Is there $60,000 more performance there? No. If all you care about are the raw numbers, the Pixel isn't an amazing value proposition, and Nexus fans understandably take issue with this. the Nexus 4, 5, 5X, and 6P all had MSRPs that were competitive, if not highly competitive, when they were released. The Google Pixels aren't really concerned with this, and I don't think Google is making an argument that they are. You're buying into Google's promise that these are the devices that will receive the highest level of support and exclusive features going forward. If that proposition is appealing to you, let's consider a few other factors. First, Google does not and likely never will offer the in-store support experience Apple does. If you buy direct from Google, using your warranty, extended or otherwise, means phone or email support and physically mailing out a device that is broken. This is not ideal, and we'll have to see if Google's support staff offers an experience a cut above typical phone manufacturers (I heard that for last year's phones, they were generally pretty good about this stuff, but I'm sure there are horror stories). Next, there's the ecosystem argument. If you buy an iPhone, it does stuff in concert with your other Apple products - be it a MacBook, an iMac, an iPad, or an Apple Watch. You can read your iMessages on your laptop, for example. Google has... Chromebooks. And Android Wear! But really, Google has built those device ecosystems around a much more open model, and I think we'll have to wait until next year to see what their grand vision for a tightly-integrated hardware ecosystem really is. But given people pay basically as much for a Galaxy S7 or S7 edge, which similarly lack such ecosystems, I think that's a bit of a red herring. So, are the Pixels good value for money? Sure, if you're of the opinion that an iPhone is good value for money. Are they great value for money? Probably not. In that sense, they're typical. What you're paying for here is more the promise of future support, advanced software features, and for an experience that is purely Google. Conclusion I feel that after the pricing was leaked, many people expected that Google would pull a rabbit out of its hat with the Pixel. There had to be something more. The truth is, it's just a very good phone, and one that Google is now making the focus of its efforts. It is the first phone with a Google software skin, and the first phone developed by Google independent of the actual Android team (well, as independent as any manufacturer). That's quite interesting: Google has made clear that the Pixel team and the Android team have a "firewall." But that doesn't stop the Pixel team from working with all the various other groups and products inside Google, and that's how we've ended up with the first, and for now only, phone with Google Assistant. The Pixel offers an incredible camera, fast software, premium materials, and high-end components. But it doesn't revolutionize the market, and it doesn't take any big risks. The Pixel, frankly, probably isn't that exciting to most people with a relatively new high-end smartphone. And I don't think it's meant to be - Google's marketing makes clear that a mainstream audience is being targeted here. The Pixel does almost everything well. In fact, it does most things very well. And it does a few things exceptionally, like taking photos. So if you've pre-ordered a Pixel, I have a feeling you won't be disappointed: it's a delight to use, and I'm already deeply attached to the Pixel XL I've been carrying for the past five days. Even the notification sounds are just right to my ears. But if you were a skeptic looking for some hidden killer feature, some justification for a price you found unthinkable? It's not as though Google was hiding the ball when they announced it. They told us what it was, and that's what it is. Google will almost certainly lose some Nexus fans over the Pixels and their high prices, and that is probably something they're well-aware of. Google isn't going after the people buying smartphones on a cost-to-spec basis, that much is obvious. Still, I very much like the Pixel, even with its slightly boring design and iPhone pricing. I like the idea of quarterly maintenance releases - releases I will get first - that install silently in the background while I continue to use my phone. I like my monthly security patches. I like having phone or chat support just a few taps away if I break my phone and need to replace it. I love the camera. The Pixel is a very hard phone not to like, and that really is a rare thing.

As always. I love your ruthlessly considered review style (something I think applies to all AP staff) compared to so many other fluffy tech blogs and mainstream news sites. I have a silver Pixel on pre-order and I'm now more excited than ever. The things that have always been most important to me are speed/performance, Google's version of Android, timely updates, decent battery life, a decent camera... and build quality. I've been holding onto my Nexus 5 for three years now despite it now falling short in the final three criteria. With the Pixel, I'm finally going to get the full package (assuming the battery is better than my N5!). The one thing I'm not entirely sold on is the EIS for video. It looks amazing... until you pan. It's a bit "video game". I think it needs a little more work, but that said I think it will work perfectly in certain applications. Google is on to something. I'm totally in love with the design. I find it wonderfully understated. The word that comes to my mind is confident. It doesn't scream "look at me" like Samsung and others tend to. Google is taking a page out of Apple's book - not by copying the iPhone design - but by taking inspiration from its philosophy and crafting something new. If the iPhone is Adam, the Pixel is Eve. N6P->PixelXL ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Well stated. Except that I'd say the iPhone is like Satan. whispy_snippet Hahaha indeed... JD Stan? N6P->PixelXL ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Yes. Stan D. Satan. Savan I have preorder Pixel XL on Oct 4, I don't care about free unlimited full resolution upload to Google Photo, I can still do that with standard resolution which works great. What are your thoughts on google giving some additional freebies to Pixel owner, such as free You Tube red subscription, some additional data for project fi users or something which actually give you pride in using it. N6P->PixelXL ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You get a free Daydream View. MJ Think bigger... Blonde with big boobs for a night. Marty Just compared prices of this Pixel and the iPhone 7. Pixel XL - 128GB: $869 IPhone 7+ - 128GB: $869 Since the Pixel is questionable because of being made by HTC, I'd rather have an iPhone 7. Also considering Safari is so much better than Chrome web browser, that's a plus. Falcon And support for 4yrs instead of 2yrs saltyzip Unlimited photo and video backup at original resolution is a big plus for Pixel, not forgetting 24/7 support too Max Johnson I'm going to admit, I am very impressed by this phone's camera. I also admit it is stupid to not allow a 64GB option. mrjayviper one of the selling points of pixel is Google assistant. So Google wants to charge more for the chance to mine my personal data even more? They should be paying me instead? Bryan Breguet I really, really dislike that you think asking for a properly calibrated screen is nitpicking or for annoying people. It is not. It's not a fringe problem. yojetski i must say - this is one of the more honest reviews out there right now for the pixel. talks about the pros and cons (ahem-price) without the hate from naysayers. seriously it is understandable to not like a phone because of its price, but for alot of people to say that it is utter garbage because it's the same $ as an iphone without even trying it? kind of ignorant. my wallet is hurting but i am excited to replace this n6. Sir_Brizz I don't think most people here think it's necessarily bad (aside from the huge bezels and lack of stereo speakers maybe) but at the price it's at it is a much different conversation. I think it looks like a nice upgrade for my 6P... at almost double the price. RNC what is the space wallpaper on phone? looks good...any link for it? thnx 4ui812 I stopped reading after ... Does its battery last the longest? No. Is its screen the best? Not likely. Is it the fastest smartphone on the planet? Eh, no (sorry, Apple still wins that battle). Is the Google Assistant as life-changingly intelligent as Google seems so amped for us believe? Hardly. In fact, it is almost obscenely easy to pick apart Google's phone - one might even say pixel by pixel - because it clearly doesn't afford itself of every bleeding-edge technology or feature it could have. The Pixel lacks waterproofing. The rear camera doesn't use optical image stabilization. The batteries aren't unusually large. There's no microSD slot. Leon Not everyone buys phones to be on the bleeding edge. Sometimes, people just want a good phone that works and is well supported. For them, this might just be it. 4ui812 I see. Thanks. Falcon Its not as well supported as apple. With the same price abc People who pay 700+ for phone, definitely expect the bleeding edge. Otherwise, they'd buy a $200 phone that works. SHunter What the hell man; do you live in a Faraday cage? angryone The only reason I switched from an iPhone to an Android years ago was to have MicroSD storage, and I'm not interested in any phone without it. If I were going to give up on MicroSD, I would just go back to an iPhone. Max Johnson Google phones, aside from the first one, never had microSD. So to complain about no microSD on Google devices are pointless, now it's valid to say you rather get a different phone. Also going to iPhone doesn't fix the problem of not having microSD. At least on Android you can connect an external USB device. me me So a few hours later I scroll in. I see 3 types of replies: 1) those who decided to buy the phone, justify themselves. 2) Those who say it is not worth buying at any price due to lack of what they want (SD slot, IP68, etc). 3) Those who say it is not worth the price but with a price drop would accept buying. If Google had set it at say half the price then it would be: a) moaning about its out of stock b) those who won't buy for lack of a feature. Prices will fall, it is just a matter of when, and really, the earlier we get the 1) morons out of the way who prop up the price, the earlier we can get to serve 3) whispy_snippet Prices will fall when the Pixel 2 launches. Part of what makes something a premium, desirable object is a high price tag. This is marketing 101. charlie Jason I'm a current 6P user. The battery life is not ideal. Under intense use the phone can noticeably heat up, slow down and stutter. The camera app lags. Screen not bright enough and too reflective, leading to poor sunlight performance. Still, there are enough reasons to love this phone for its price. Still photography is still incredible. Front facing speakers are great. I think I will stick with it for another year or two. My next phone would probably be an Oneplus, now that they don't have invite system anymore. Nexus has died and Google isn't offering a good value phone in the foreseeable future. Can't bear heavily skinned Android either. Jay Happy to read the review. Glad people are excited for this. Lots of IPhone comparisons here. If Google is really trying to take the IPhone approach, why can't they change the update OS policy to match Apple's as well? black What about the fast charging capability? Is it as fast as they claim? Does it make up for the small battery capacity? I'd like to know more about the Pixel's battery (not the XL's). Presjar Do a side by side vs the S7 Edge. It is even better than the Iphone7. Samsung make a far superior camera. The Sony sensor in the Pixel is not good enough considering the phone costs the same! Pedro Diego Fernández I don't know... I'm not a nexus fan but for a 800$ phone, I would expect something better than "very good"... that sounds like something you say at a restaurant meaning it's good enough not to send it back but nothing to get you excited... Maybe it's because for my budget I only consider phones for less than 300$ and feel really satisfied with them, so a 800$ phone should be something special to get my attention. So far the only thing special about the pixels is the "made by google" part which I don't think is enough... but time and sales will tell if this was a hit or a miss. I think the real question for the author would be "if you had to spend your own money, would you have bought this phone?" If I had the money I think would have gone Samsung S7 in a heart beat. olivrstal I really appreciate the detailed information about the display saturation in this review. Great job! I guess I probably have to go with that sRGB mode from the developer settings once again. Really enjoyed my time with the Nexus 6P but if there wasn't the sRGB mode I probably would've returned it. Out of the box the colors looked ridiculously oversaturated imo. (I do quite a bit mobile photography, so I want the photos to look somewhat natural on the screen for further editing.) With that Nexus 6P in the sRGB mode, the mode always was turned off, after the phone was shut down, so I always had to activate it again when I restarted the phone (which fortunately didn't happen that often because of that large battery.) Does anyone know if this is still the case and, if it is, if there is a way that I can maintain that sRGB mode even if I restart the phone? Garrett Bridges I was going to skip the first Pixel and go with next year's instead, but my 6P decided an impromptu trip from my pocket during a roller coaster was in order, so I pre-ordered one from Verizon the other day. Sadly it keeps saying it won't come until the 28th. :( I do have to say, this review dampened my expectations and excitement a little. You say it's a good phone, repeatedly, but not having much "great" to say about it made it seem like it has no wow-factor. I'm almost second-guessing my decision and thinking of going for another 6P. Someone help! :-x saltyzip Perhaps the Verge Review will convince you to stick with Pixel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJOgF15LLZk Garrett Bridges That's somewhat better. I envy reviewers getting sent these things! I have to finance this sucker because I'm still paying off my nuked 6P. Eric Horchuck To me this guy came off as a Samsung fan. I know that this is an opinion piece and not "journalism", by any stretch, but my god; I was waiting for "and the lack of a physical, front, home button...". ☺️. Also, for an Android site with Android fans maybe don't use iPhone comparisons (I haven't had an iPhone since the 4), I mean, who cares? I'll be ordering the Pixel XL (I'm thinking in silver since it's the first 'white front' Google phone (Nexus were always black front)) as soon as it's back in the Google store. I think it's awesome and not in a trendy way. Take care, all! JD David a samsung fan? What you smoking? C64 It's still an overpriced iPhone lookalike with huge bezels / chin evo34 Why do you care about looks so much? Do you pose with your phone in front of the mirror in the morning? C64 I look every day at it. So yes i care about the looks. If you can choose to wake up everyday next to a beautiful women or a ugly pig. You'll choose the pig? evo34 The fact that you compare your phone to a woman speak volumes... evo34 I don't fuck my phone C64 I doub you fuck anything JB Nice shoes 👍 Marcelove What a surprise David, with you praising the Pixel and trying to convince readers to buy it... /s Finally we found the android version of Nilay Patel... And like him, always denying any bias towards anything from Apple, everyone can cleary see now who personificates the same pattern when speaking about android... Phone_Addiction This is basically an android version of an iPhone and, yet it still gets love Benjamin Lehto I wonder how long the $1000 smartphone era will last, or more like, how long will the means remain viable for the majority of people that either buy them or get them on contract (which results in paying more over the length of the contract yes)? I get the impression that money is getting much tighter for more and more people and eventually you'd think that that would result in less "Things" being bought, and therefore ends in a new shift of premium devices simply not being purchased in the numbers needed to justify building these devices. I dunno. abazigal The smartphone remains an integral part of many people's lives. As long as this is the status quo, I daresay there will be no shortage of people willing to pay a premium for what they perceive to be a better user experience. BoFiS It's unfortunate that Google still refuses to put MicroSD slots on their devices, or stereo speakers, or waterproof them...but really I'm upset that the smaller Pixel is still pretty large, larger than the GS7, so really they have a large phone and an XL phone, how about a smaller, compact model?? Why is Sony the only company to understand that? Testraindrop "larger than the GS7" ... while having a smaller screen and onscreen buttons compared to the GS7... Singh Nexus 4 mentioned in the article ! Yay Max Johnson Still the best looking and most comfortable to grip Google phone. Singh And running Nougat like a boss 😎 JD When Google can offer 4-5 years of support then they can start charging iPhone like prices. Borgman You're going to be waiting a long while thereasoner You get 3 full OS versions(3 years)at minimum and all point updates with security patches continuing into year 4. What's more is that the phone won't slow to a crawl like old iPhones do when they try and run the latest OS version. What's more is the live on device support provided with the Pixel phones that is 24/7, now that's great support ! I know people with old iPhones who are afraid to update because of the associated performance issues old iPhones get. JD Where do you get 3 years? Just because some phones and tablets got didn't make it Google's official policy. They only promise 18 and 24 months for OS and security updates respectively which is a joke. I said I want 4-5 years of support, I never said I want 4-5 years of full OS (Letter change) updates, it would be great if Google did that but I'm looking for Product support. As much as people complain that Apple's updates slow down phones, at least the 4S had 5 years of security updates with it and you have the option of taking the update or not. You don't get a choice when a device is abandoned. A custom ROM isn't nearly the same I don't want to pay the money Google is asking for to hope that some volunteers will create a ROM with a homebrewed device tree in year 3. Sure 24/7 Live support sounds good (it's a start), but I want the option of a store front as well so I can walk in and show them a physical defect. thereasoner 18 months? Where did you get that from? Got a link? Nexus devices that I'm aware of have seen 3 OS versions in their life and when Google announced monthly security patches a while back they said that they would continue after OS updates stop. I came home with a "physical defect" ony wife's Motorola, the carrier changed it out on the spot the next day, no Moto Store required for that. JD Have you been living under a rock? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices thereasoner Lmao!! You need to check that again. " at least 2 years" of support is in addition to the 1st OS version/year you already have in the first year and Google only mentions 18 months when talking about devices AFTER they are no longer sold on the Google Store, as in 18 months MORE support than they already had while for sale on their online store. I know, math is hard :-) JD I know right math is hard. But you know what's harder learning to read. Look at the hard end dates of support for the Nexus phones dumb ass. But you know what's easy? your mom. thereasoner What are you like 12 years old? Lol. It says no guaranteed OS update for the 6p and 5x AFTER September 2017. There's no reason to believe that they won't get their 3rd OS version next fall like Nexus devices before it. You're reading it as support ends September 2017 but they're NOT saying that. In fact they should get next years OS version AND any related point updates over the following year as well as security patches for 18 more months seeing that they just came off the Google Store earlier this month. That puts both of those devices 6 months into year 4 before support end exactly like I said ! JD Let me go tell my 2013 Nexus 5 it's going to be supported in to march 2017. Oh wait... thereasoner Lmao! Your Nexus 5 launched with Android K and also received Android L and Android M. That's 3 full versions and years of support. Google wasn't doing security patches for long so their improved support that has devices getting security patches into year 4 or 18 months after they stop selling them may not apply to 2013 devices. The point is that Google has improved support into year 4 now and you have them getting worse with only 18 months to 2 years of support apparently because math and reading comprehension isn't your thing! Just stfu already! JD Listen you fucktard Google hasn't said shit now stfu while I go line up and plow your mom dcdttu tl;dr Design - meh Display - meh+ Battery - meh Storage - meh Wireless - meh Reception - meh+ Audio - meh Speakers - meh Camera - great! Performance - meh Software - meh Google Assistant - meh Launcher Shortcuts - sure Backup - great! Moves - meh Night Light - meh Wallpapers - great! OS look and feel - meh Stability - fine Value - meh Conclusion - review might have been written on an extremely dreary day Testraindrop Sums it up perfectly, that comment should be featured under the article ;) Da Fuq "Right now, we've got a skeletal version" Is it rich in calcium? Zack Kibler Wow a mention of a Samsung screen that includes the Basic mode. I get so mad when people compare, say the iPhone 7, to the GS7 and talk about how super-saturated the Samsung is compared to the natural colors of the iPhone. Basic mode is pretty much perfect, if realistic color is what you're after. MyClRental AtGmail I'm surprised that there is no mention of the Pixel's value in the increased availability/timeliness /frequency of OS/security/bug/feature/function updates and upgrades that are often delayed and/or undelivered by the double negative lock gates of third-party android device vendor & mobile device carrier, PARTICULARLY that Bastion of Inactivity otherwise known as Verizon. abazigal I will believe it when I see it. arthur if the price would be arround 500 euros = good phone... ... but its not! ps: nobody likes those bezels! Cat Astrophy Those regular security updates better not break my root Rod Those should be the least of your concerns. https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/58npsl/71_appears_to_aggressively_fix_errors_to_the/ Melannie Sandi If it is not as good as other devices (including iphone) and as expensive as an iphone I would rather spending that much money on an iphone. Coming from google I couldn't be more disappointed. As you said it doesn't have anything new, cool, killer, is not even better, is not even among the best, is even boring, but just because it is from google it is easier to forgive all those things missing for tiny details like a "great camera" giving excuses like mainstream market targeted. Is too expensive for no reason, just cause they wanted it to be expensive Devin Rodriguez How is Android Auto with the Pixel? Is there Assistant integration or maybe Auto 2.0? Ben Sin that part of the review where it explains how unremarkable the phone is "is the battery the largest? no is the screen the best? no" onto the part where David justifies the phone's high points sums up why the Pixel isn't worth it to me, as someone who lives in Asia. all the cons he mentions -- no waterproofing, no microSD expansion, no OIS -- are all quite real complaints. but the pros he lists? being able to switch carriers? no bloatware? lol those are all US carrier BS problems. there's no bloatware in international phones, there's no problem switching sim cards. and stuff like "google photos stores your pics at full resolution" is cool but google photos already let you store unlimited photos in a slightly compressed, but still more than enough for most people, format. Testraindrop Yeah, while its mentioned that this review is from a US point of view, outside of the US the positive points just don't really exist (except camera). - Assistant: Will be more or less useless like Google Now outside US - Cloud backup: 4K videos up+downloading eats all free data in day - Carriers: GSM, would be bad if it would not work on any carrier - 24/7 support: lets see about that in each country outside US Marco I have played with an XL at the store, and while shooting 1080p videos at 60fps, I've noticed the display is flickering, and also the video stuttered a couple of times for the first 2 seconds. Anyone noticed that? Maybe it's just because they are demo unit? I really want to switch to this baby and finally ditch ios.... Danske I believe that would the camera frame rate picking up the store's lights "frame rate" if you know what I mean. For example, fluorescent light tubes usually flicker at a frame rate higher than the human eye can see, but when they're on their way out, they flicker low enough to be seen with the classic eyeballs. Rod "Classic eyeballs" I lol'ed Luiz Marin i really hope that theres a led notification... _jack_ that should be much more mentioned and appreciated in reviews :) Rod There is a RBG led. bugdroid It's sooo beatiful :-) I want to eat it. likurges this phone gives me no reasons to buy it if I look at the competition Rod The competition doesn't deliver stock Android and quick updates. likurges Well in my case I really don't care about stock, if anything I prefer some skins because of the more festures that they offer. As for the updates its Nice to have them quickly but again it's not really that important to me. I want a fast phone with good battery like, great Camera that looks good, I would buy the note 7 but well... I think the 7 edge will do Rod Pixel looks ok, and has the best camera. Give it a try. likurges I personally don't like how it looks and the Camera is comparable to the se but it has a lot less features. Another thing that I really don't care about nor can I fully use in my country is Google asistent. This is why I can't think of a single reason to buy this phone Rod What features? Unlimited backup for photos/videos is nice, too. Michael Pahl When HDR is set to ON and not Auto, the camera is PAINFULLY slow.... 4-5 times slower than the Note 7 Like OG Droid Turbo slow. Mike Mine was delivered today and I am very, very impressed. It feels damn near perfect in every respect. I know it doesn't have every desirable feature and it's priced at a premium - but just use the device before rushing to judgement. Đức Thành I am happy to hear that. Sounds really great. kaibosh What a dull, uninspired phone. Can someone tell me one single thing a Pixel can do better than an Axon 7 at half the cost? Also, what is with you guys talking about lag because of how many apps you have installed? Seriously? I have over 400 apps on my OPO 1 and there is no lag - ever. Are you people actually running stock operating systems? Like, for real? There is not one single feature listed in the above review that I don't have on my phone. Yes, that includes the Assistant. I can't believe reviewers don't have the balls to call Google out for a cookie cutter boring brick of a phone that is 40% overpriced. It has a fast camera - and that is *all* it has. Rod Getting updates. The-Sailor-Man Who cares? First- Google always lag with the new features that other phones have. Second, many updates slower the phones. Rod I didn't say anyone cared, I simply responded to the author's question: "Can someone tell me one single thing a Pixel can do better than an Axon 7 at half the cost?" illstplaya . I only have one problem and that's the very weird and extremely ugly white or colored background behind the apps. Why does the camera have that ugly white circle behind it? Same goes for the play music app and the play store and YouTube etc... That's just very ugly. The phone app has a blue circle behind it. The messaging app and a stupid circle behind it. Why do most of the apps have this crap? It's so bad. I've included a picture of my home screen, just to compare to the home screen on the pixel which shows the apps with the ugly circle behind it, and my screen that does not have that strange crap. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5c2677ae1ac8e07a727b2a9b8e72d8470bfe08e23d7466a2a554b2672c2ec2ff.png Đức Thành Because Google just started a circle icons trend for their apps. We all know it looks weird, but not much we can do about it but wait until we get used to it. [email protected] Is the new Assistant really better than Siri ? I can't get Assistant to even take a simple note. Sure, it does better with searching the internet for the Presidents birthday. But I want an assistant that can change an appt on my calendar. Siri can do that but Assistant can't. I want to be able to modify reminders. Or create reminders that show up in a specific place where I can see them all together. With Google who knows where your reminders are stored. Are they stored in Calendar or Inbox or Google Now or Keep. I don't know because reminders created in Assistant don't show up in any of those places for me. I asked Assistant the other day for my calendar. It brought up a Google search. WTF. Want Assistant to open an app. The reply I got yesterday was another Google search. So in the future it may be better, but right now I don't agree. I don't think Siri is necessarily better, but I would say at this point they are about equal. And with the recent companies Apple has purchased you better bet Siri is going to be getting much better. Assistant better work a lot better when Google Home comes out or there are going to be a lot of pissed off people. I want what Google is advertising not what they are working on. I don't want to be a tester. If it can't maybe someone will sue the crap out of Google for false advertising. And you better bet I will return mine if it can't do what Google shows in their videos. I am excited Google is getting into fully into hardware, but they better make sure it works or people will abandon it as fast as this bought it. Rod https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFiu5rfnhzo Yay Bubbles I will act as the voice of alarmist reason and tell you the truth. Don't buy it. I don't care what it costs or what it does. Google is a child with ADHD. It has dropped, cancelled, and screwed people on ALMOST every single hardware item it has sold. PROOF? SOURCE?: I bought a GOOGLE TV, a year later, Google dropped support, made a half ass update, and to this day, either the current apps don't work like they should or I am restricted in some manner from downloading apps which would make it work like ti should. Not a big deal, but here's the thing, when apple has a product, even if it's not the best, such as apple tv, they stick with it, support it, and refine it over time (or at least they used to under Jobs) Why commit to something which past experiences have proven will end in failure and heart ache. The choice is yours. Bye Felicia! Rod Well, I feel sorry for you, but I've had 4 Nexus devices, and all of them had 3 years of support. Nothing to whine about. Falcon I dont think he is talking about security updates. All nexus only received 2 major updates (name change updates) Rod Sorry, I didn't specify the type of update. But, 3 years of support for a smartphone is pretty decent nowadays. Of course Apple nails it with those 5 years, though. Hexlattice I just saw a Verizon Pixel commercial and I'm honestly confused by how Verizon gets away with this "only at Verizon" lie that they're saying in this commercial... Like, I feel bad for anyone that believes it. João Victor Schiavo "and LG's phones probably do something better but I'm struggling on that one at the moment." LMAO Msinko I could never. Looks too much like a iPhone, Android 7 as well. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Awesome, tremendous phone. The best all-around phone on the planet, bar none. JohnyNoLegs Although not perfect, it makes my enjoy using my phone. Zero lag, always keeps apps in the background, amazing speaker and camera, display is fantastic (not the best compared to my note 7), but as a whole I would take this phone over 6p or note 7 any day. Roberto Virga "The Pixel is IP53, which is basically to say it has no real water-resistance." I disagree. Here's a real-life anecdote. A few days ago I went to play Pokemon Go under a light rain. From time to time, a few drops of rain fell on my Nexus 6P, which I promptly wiped with a paper tissue. At the time, the phone looked fine. However, later that day, I experienced several random reboots, something this phone had never done before. Luckily, whatever humidity had accumulated inside slowly dissipated, and I haven't experienced any more random reboots since that day. This experience has taught me several things, such as - you could do much worse than IP53; - while for a smartwatch I wouldn't settle for anything less than IP67, for a phone resistance to light or moderate rain might be enough for me. Linked Devices Besides the camera and Google assistant. What features does this phone really offer over the 8 month older S7? The S7 has the Gear VR already fully up and running with enough quality titles that I haven't been able to get through all of them. It has the exclusive SAPA engine compatible with iRig, sound camp, thumb jam etc to do ultra low latency studio quality audio production and live processing for on stage without missing a beat (the only other phone line that can do the same is the iPhone). It has Samsung cloud and simple sharing which lets you share hundreds of pictures or any file actually of any file size to anyone in your contact list which basically amounts to free web hosting It is IP68 water resistant which allows the phone to be used as an underwater camera which works amazingly well with their auto sensitivity adjusting screen. It can take pictures on raw mode and has a fully fleshed out pro mode making it a truly professional camera. It's display is literally the most accurate available on the market right now. It features the Knox Subsystem which lets you run two fully encrypted separate isolated Android environment simultaneously. It has Samsung pay which has far broader compatibility than Android pay--it literally works anywhere you can swipe a card. It's battery lasts a full hour or two longer. It runs faster and with less lag as demonstrated in side by side comparisons. It has 24/7 tech support by voice, text or even video chat via the Samsung + app. The list can go on. Why would the pixel cost more than the S7? That just doesn't make any sense. You're getting so much less. Pursuer The laggy iPhone 7 still wins the battle??? Amit Avasthi I think the game is very different. Google is taking a leap to be first movers by controlling hardware to demonstrate what AI can do. It may also mean the new OS could come on pixel next Jeremy V. Riedl Hey, i know this is off topic, but when are you going to publish a review for the LG V20? You guys are dead last in doing this and usually the people i go to first for reviews. You published a hands on review almost two months ago and haven't published an actual review yet. Meanwhile Google releases a phone and you have a review published in like five days. Jeremy V. Riedl How long till you finish your V20 review that you started 2 months ago? This one you managed to get done in 5 days. Magdee Alshbith Hi I'm from London I just bought two of the Google pixel XL 128g and spend £819.99 on each one of them with the total cost of 1639.98 pounds for the two of them there's something really annoying and I didn't expect that from such a high-end phone by Google , it doesn't actually show the notification on each app !!!!!!🤔🤔 like how many missed calls I have received or how many emails I have received or how many WhatsApp messages or calls I have received UNTIL i must drop the notification bar from the top of the screen to be able to see and check them all or I have to go in to each app to see how many messages I have received !!!!!?? i expect that each app should have a notification sign and a number of how many messages or emails or calls received like any other Android and iOS device . and one more thing while you are typing a message and you want to go back between words and you want to add some adjustments and try to point between letters it's NOT actually flexible and accurate it will freezes up for a second because of spelling suggestions even when the words are correct this actually slow down the typing procedure a little bit . the typing experience is fine but switching between lines while you are typing it's slow and not flexible like the Samsung or the iPhone typing experience and even if you want to compose a message by Google voice typing it's slow and not always accurate . the two XL devices I have are the same with the typing and message voice experience!! I know this could be a little things but those are a MAJOR problem for Android users especially with this Price Tag you just don't expect some little problems like this and i know that Google has taking a long time to develop this device and they should be aware of such a little things that could be a major problem not to having this particular device compare to other smartphones in the market today . I hope this all could be fixed as soon as possible by in update from Google or I'm returning the devices back before the 28 days off not satisfaction time will end . Thiago Oliveira I know a bug: like some iPhone 5S, when Google Pixel is plugged on third party USB, the touch screen gets a bit irresponsive. kingRoot One one question : Can this be rooted easily by sing apps like KingRoot? Or we need a lengthy process? Владимир Петров First year for Pixel is just a test priod. Peaple will look at support, development of features, polishing the os and UI. If it held well until Pixel 2 come, then the smartphone worth it's money. By this I mean also working on mistakes like getting rid of the glass panel (it tends to break and create flares, scratches), improved durability (doesn't pass drop tests at all), portrait camera (50mm+), waterproofing. Assistant doesn't have support in other countries as well as 24 hour google support. Allo lacks backup. Etc... Now there is too much compromice. And google experience could be even better on the iPhone (the phone with the same price I mean). I used to have nexus 5 and I loved it! But 1 year waste with snapdragon 810 (let's tell the truth, it's unsuccessfull processor) made me switch to iPhone. This year I hoped to move back to Android, but Pixel dissapointed a little. Hope, that next year everything that google promised would work exactly right. TreasuresQueen This is a great phone! I do, however, have an issue with the Messenger app. It doesn't LOCK messages at all. The camera is awesome on it though I miss the ability to shake my phone and access the camera as I did on my Motorola phone. I wish the phantom space on the end of the phone was an additional speaker! My phone also overheats but then again, I'm playing Pokemon Go on it LOL KingRoot Google Pixel is just brilliance <3 - kingRoot Anas Ali This article is well written and very informative.

This time round we're treated to Google Smart Lock integration and new Nest Cam notifications. The Nest app supports Google Smart Lock, letting you log in to your Nest app without needing to remember your password Nest Cam lets you set notifications for motion activity, person alerts (with a Nest Aware subscription), or both. Family members can set their own notification settings Discover new Works with Nest partner products through the in-app catalogue The addition of Google Smart Lock will make it super easy for you to access the Nest app. Let's face it: nobody likes having to remember passwords. And the ability for different family members to set their own distinct Nest Cam notifications is exactly the kind of well thought out enhancement we've come to expect from Nest. These add to the Nest app's already impressive list of features to help you control devices such as the Learning Thermostat and Protect alarm, as well as the aforementioned Nest Cam.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 14 April 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM Tech companies tout gender pay equity but balk at transparency Both Facebook and Google are facing – and opposing – shareholder proposals on gender pay equity for the second year in a row, with activists saying their refusal to divulge this information “makes it look like they have something to hide.” — AFP Relaxnews When Grace Anderson prints out her resume, she notices 20% of it is missing. Still, her qualifications are so good that she’s offered the job she seeks by a man who says, “We think you’ll be pleased with the offer – that we gave someone else. You’ll be making 20% less.”  Grace is a character in a video prepared for Equal Pay Day on April 4 by LeanIn.org, the women’s empowerment group founded by Facebook Inc chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg. While the humorous video shows blatant discrimination, the reality of the gender wage gap is far more complex and opaque.  Though many companies, including Facebook, say they pay men and women equally, they are loath to share the data, even when pressed by investors, employees and government regulators.  The most prominent recent example is Alphabet Inc’s Google. A Department of Labour official said in court on April 7 that it has found “systemic compensation disparities” against women at the company. In a statement late April 10, Google said it was “taken aback by this assertion, which came without any supporting data or methodology.”  The DOL sued the company in January for refusing to provide compensation information as part of a compliance audit of federal contractors. The agency declined to comment, citing the ongoing case.  “Very few companies have opened the black box,” said Emily Martin, vice-president for workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Centre. “Most have just said, 'trust us.’"  Without transparency on how compensation gap statistics are calculated, including pay and job categories used, “it’s hard to know if their analysis is credible,” she added.  Calculating a gender pay gap requires a significant amount of data, said Linda Chen, a principal at Mercer, the consulting firm that performs the analyses for many companies. That could include hire date, education, role, overtime, bonus, and even performance ratings, usually taken as a snapshot at a particular point in time. Most companies store this in their human resources information systems, she said.  The DOL asked Google for a snapshot of its workforce as of Sept 1, 2015, and Sept 1, 2014, according to the lawsuit, which seeks to bar the company from federal contracts if it doesn’t comply. Google currently gets only a few million dollars annually in federal contracts, according to Bloomberg BNA. That’s a pittance compared to its US$90bil (RM397.12bil) revenue last year, but the company has big aspirations for its cloud-computing business and losing the US government as a potential customer would be a blow.  In a blog post on Monday, Eileen Naughton, Google’s human resources chief, wrote that the company sets compensation each year using analysts who don’t know the gender of employees. If women or men, as a group, are paid a statistically significantly lower amount, Google adjusts to bring the group’s pay in line, she said.  Still, Google should give the government the data it’s seeking so that it can explain the gaps the DOL is signalling, said Martin of the National Women’s Law Centre. “The things they say they’re doing sound like the right kind of things,” she added. Not sharing its information “makes it look like they have something to hide.”  Increased regulatory and public scrutiny of pay means that “we have seen a surge in the past couple of years in companies that are looking at it pro-actively,” said Mercer’s Chen.  While working women overall make about 20% less than men, the gap shrinks to about 5.6% when controlled for specific job roles, seniority, and other factors according to Glassdoor Inc, operator of a job and career site. At tech companies, the gap is about 5.9%.  Many tech companies, prodded by shareholders, last year announced they had studied the amounts they pay men and women and that there either was no gap or that it was small and they were taking steps to close it. Google blocked an investor request to report on any gender pay gaps at its annual meeting last year. A former Google software engineer, Erica Baker, said in 2015 that she was reprimanded by her manager after she created a spreadsheet on the company’s internal social network where workers could share compensation information.  Glassdoor on April 11 said its salary data showed male Google employees earn about 16.3% more than women, but that an apples-to-apples comparison adjusted for similar jobs and backgrounds shrinks the gap to about 1.6%. That’s “not statistically significant from zero,” Glassdoor chief economist Andrew Chamberlain said in a blog post.  But even a 1% pay gap companywide can be statistically significant, especially if the gap is persistent over time, said Chen, who was speaking generally and not about Google in particular.  Pay audits often reveal broader issues in the workplace, such as the lack of women in a particular job category. “Pay equity is a great tip-of-the-spear analysis, because it can open up a broader range of areas that need to be addressed,” she said. “Maybe we can explain away the entire pay gap, but that doesn’t mean the work is done.”  For instance, women make up just 18% of all software developers, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. In that category, they earn 20% less than men. At Google, women hold 19% of technical jobs, according to the company’s website.  Some shareholders want companies to pay workers fairly, and have stepped up pressure. In the 2017 proxy season, investors have filed at least 18 pay equity proposals, according to ISS Corporate Solutions. That compares with 13 in 2016 and just one in 2015, the first year ISS recorded such actions.  Both Facebook and Google are facing – and opposing – shareholder proposals on gender pay equity for the second year in a row. With insiders controlling voting rights through special classes of stock, the proposals won’t pass, but they draw further attention to the issue.  Last year, almost half of the non-insider investors voted in favour of the proposal at Google, according to Natasha Lamb, director of shareholder engagement at Arjuna Capital, which filed the proposal with Proxy Impact and The Sustainability Group. But that translated into just 12% of voting rights because of the special shares owned by management. The proposal sought a gender pay gap measurement that included base salary, bonus and equity awards if possible, and a commitment to close any gap that was found.  Proxy Impact chief executive officer Michael Passoff said he held his first call with Google in March 2016 asking for more disclosure on pay structures. At the time, Google promised a fuller report by October of that year, but it didn’t come, Passoff said. “This year, they have been completely non-responsive,” he added.  At Facebook, too, the Arjuna proposal failed. It will go to a vote again at the company’s annual meeting this year. “Facebook falls in the laggard category along with Google in actually disclosing their pay gap number,” Lamb said. Sandberg “has been nothing short of a hypocrite on gender pay equity – no numbers, no accountability, no authentic leadership.”  Lori Matloff Goler, Facebook’s global head of human resources, said the company built systems many years ago to ensure that men and women are paid equally. She said last year that the company had no gender wage gap, and reiterated that last week. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested It's all over for Windows Vista – time for a new version AMD betting on extra-fast WiFi to open up virtual reality Virtual reality may soon help your overcome your fear of spiders SP Setia to be largest owner of prime land in country (Update) Put the brakes on our road terrors Number of ultra-high-net-worth Malaysians growing Others Also Read Federal Court rejects appeal, orders extradition of Bangkok bombing suspect Kudos for promoting Islamic cruising New Stylo China showroom set to link buyers and designers advertisement Latest News CIA chief calls WikiLeaks a ‘hostile intelligence service’ Company behind bitcoin creator sold to private investors Facebook cracks down on 30,000 fake accounts in France Microsoft says US foreign intelligence surveillance requests more than doubled Uber may face US$1mil fine over California drunken-driving complaints Most Viewed in Tech Your magnetic smartphone holder could be disrupting your reception Mere tilt of your phone could cost you security Facebook cracks down on 30,000 fake accounts in France Uber may face US$1mil fine over California drunken-driving complaints Microsoft says US foreign intelligence surveillance requests more than doubled Samsung Electronics says Galaxy S8 pre-orders exceeded S7 Apple considering multi-billion dollar investment in Toshiba chip unit Everybody hurts as Australia gets yet another mobile network Watch out for the hidden costs of free-to-play games GM to add 1,100 jobs in California over five years at self-driving unit Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)
Business Technology Uber accused of using a secret program called Hell to track Lyft drivers Uber sign Seth Wenig / Associated Press A sign points the way for the Uber car service at LaGuardia Airport in New York. A sign points the way for the Uber car service at LaGuardia Airport in New York. (Seth Wenig / Associated Press) Times staff and wire reports A new report says Uber used a secret software program dubbed Hell to track Lyft drivers to see if they were driving for both ride-hailing services — information that could be used to stifle competition. The tool allowed Uber to monitor its competitor’s rates and steer additional fares toward drivers who were using both platforms, which could have influenced drivers to commit to Uber alone, according to a story in the technology trade publication the Information. Only a small group of Uber employees, including Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, knew about the program, according to the Information, which cited an anonymous source it said wasn't authorized to speak publicly. The program was discontinued in early 2016, according to the report. A representative for Uber did not respond to messages for comment Thursday. Lyft said in a statement to the publication that “if true, the allegations are very concerning.” This has been a tumultuous year for Uber. In addition to the allegations of the Hell program, the San Francisco company’s troubles have included executive departures, backlash over Kalanick’s role as an advisor to President Trump, sexual harassment allegations, a video showing Kalanick lashing out at a driver, a lawsuit by Google spinoff Waymo, a potential fine from state authorities and the revelation of a secret program that mined user data in an effort to thwart regulators. Read more: Uber's self-inflicted controversies come at a price: public loyalty » Intoxicated-driver complaints California’s ride-hailing regulator is proposing a $1.1-million fine against Uber for allegedly failing to investigate or promptly suspend drivers accused in complaints of driving while drunk or drugged. The California Public Utilities Commission said in a legal filing released Wednesday that Uber hadn’t taken appropriate action in 151 cases from August 2014 to August 2015, in violation of the state’s zero-tolerance regulations against intoxicated drivers. The agency also alleged that the company’s DUI policies are too lax and do not comply with state rules. Uber’s policy, according to the agency, is to deactivate a driver who is the subject of three unconfirmed zero-tolerance complaints. The regulator said in its filing that the policy is too lenient and that the company doesn’t even adhere to it. In at least 25 cases, the agency alleges, Uber failed to suspend or investigate a driver after three or more complaints. Read more: Uber could face $1.1-million California fine for failing to investigate drivers accused of being intoxicated » Waymo lawsuit Google spinoff Waymo sued Uber in February, alleging theft of trade secrets. That’s a big deal, since Uber has pegged its future to self-driving vehicles. The Waymo suit alleges that Levandowski — the former Waymo employee who now heads Uber’s self-driving car division — downloaded more than 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary files shortly before his resignation in January 2016. He went on to found self-driving truck start-up Otto, which was acquired by Uber in August for $680 million. Levandowski now heads Uber’s self-driving car division. Waymo alleges Otto is using its proprietary technology. In addition to punitive damages, Waymo sought a preliminary injunction against Uber to stop the company from continuing development on self-driving cars. Uber told a federal judge in early April that it didn’t use stolen trade secrets for its driverless car project, and that therefore the court shouldn’t force it to stop that work. Read more: Uber says it didn't use secrets smuggled from Waymo » Diversity report In a bid to show that it is serious about transparency and cultural turnaround, ride-hailing giant Uber released data March 28 on diversity in its workforce. The numbers show that Uber, like other technology companies, has struggled to attract women, Latinos and African Americans to its workforce. Nearly two-thirds of Uber’s global workforce is male, and more than three-quarters of leadership roles at the company are held by men. The company didn’t release data about the racial composition of its global workforce, but it said that in the U.S., black and Latino workers comprise just 15% of employees. (The data do not include Uber drivers, who are classified as independent contractors.) Uber executives also introduced a pledge to spend $3 million over the next three years with organizations trying to help underrepresented groups break into the tech industry. Read more: Uber reveals how white and male its workforce is » Self-driving car is hit in a crash Uber suspended tests of its self-driving cars for a few days after one of its SUVs was struck in a high-impact collision in Arizona on March 24. Police in Tempe said that the Uber vehicle was obeying the law and that the driver of the other car, who was making a left turn at an intersection and didn’t yield, was cited for a moving violation. There were two operators and no passengers in the Volvo SUV, Uber said in a statement. No one was seriously injured. Uber leaders back the CEO In a March 21 conference call with reporters, Uber board member Arianna Huffington reaffirmed the board’s support for Kalanick. “It’s clear both Uber and the whole ride-sharing industry would not be where we are today without Travis,” Huffington said in response to a question about whether Uber’s board of directors would consider asking Kalanick to step down, given the bumpy road down which he has led the company. “The board has complete confidence in Travis. He started as a scrappy entrepreneur and now he has to bring about changes in himself,” Huffington said. “I’m personally a big believer in leaders and companies being allowed to evolve." Uber’s chief human resources officer, Liane Hornsey, was also on the call and said the company would be launching unconscious bias training programs for employees, updating 1,500 job descriptions to ensure they are free of unconscious bias and continuing its search for a chief operating officer. President quits Uber’s president resigned in mid-March after just six months on the job. Uber president resigns amid a host of problems The New York Times reported that Uber had been using a program to thwart authorities trying to curtail or shut down the service.

But the tech blog Recode, which first reported his resignation, said Kalanick told employees that Jones decided to resign after Kalanick announced his intention to hire a chief operating officer earlier in the month. Jones, a former chief marketing officer at Target Corp., told Recode that his values didn't align with Uber's. "The beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the ride sharing business," he said in a statement. Read more: Uber president quits after six months on the job » Executive search In March, a week after saying he would seek leadership help, Kalanick announced he had begun the search for a chief operating officer — “a peer who can partner with me to write the next chapter in our journey.” Secret ‘Greyball’ program In early March it was revealed that Uber had been wielding a secret weapon to thwart authorities trying to curtail or shut down its ride-hailing service. The program included a feature nicknamed “Greyball” that identified regulators who were posing as riders while trying to collect possible evidence that Uber's service was breaking local laws governing taxis, the New York Times reported. To stymie those efforts, Uber served up a fake version of its app to make it appear the undercover regulators were summoning a car, only to have the ride canceled. The company mined the data that it collects through its real app to pinpoint the undercover agents. Uber acknowledged it has used Greyball to counter regulators working with the company's opponents to entrap its drivers, saying Greyball was part of a broader program it developed to protect itself and its drivers from “fraudulent users who are violating our terms of service.” Less than a week after Greyball was revealed, Uber announced that it would kill the feature. Read more: Secret 'Greyball' program shows just how far Uber will go to get its way » CEO caught on video berating driver A dashcam video, released by Bloomberg News in late February, showed Kalanick arguing with Uber driver Fawzi Kamel over Uber’s fares, which Kamel complained were too low. Toward the end of their exchange, the video showed Kalanick losing his temper. “You know what? Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own ...,” he says, using a vulgarity. “They blame everything in their life on somebody else. Good luck!” After the video became public, Kalanick issued an apology to all employees, saying he was ashamed. “I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,” the 40-year-old executive said. “This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.” Uber CEO pledges to 'grow up' after video shows him lashing out at a driver » Executive’s abrupt exit Uber’s senior vice president of engineering reportedly was asked to leave in late February, just five weeks after Uber announced his hiring. Kalanick sought Amit Singhal’s resignation after learning that Singhal had failed to disclose that there was a sexual harassment claim against him at his previous job at Google, Recode reported. Singhal said in a statement that he did not condone nor had he ever committed harassment and that the decision to leave Google was his own. Read more: Uber executive leaves after failing to disclose sex harassment allegation » Sexual harassment allegation Former Uber employee Susan J. Fowler sent ripples through the tech industry in February when she alleged on her personal blog that she had been sexually harassed while working for the company, that other female engineers had reported similar problems — some involving the same manager — and that Uber’s human resources department engaged in a systemic cover-up. Kalanick said in a memo to employees that the blog post was the first he’d heard of the incident. The company called in former U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric Holder to conduct an independent investigation. Read more: Uber sexual harassment allegations are a warning for the tech industry and its 'rock star' culture » Trump-related backlash Some 200,000 users deleted the Uber app in late January to protest Kalanick’s perceived cooperation with the Trump administration, shortly after Trump issued an executive order banning travelers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. The boycott — along with the hashtag #DeleteUber — hit the company after it advertised that it was operating at New York’s Kennedy International Airport during a taxi strike protesting the executive order. Protesters also were upset that Kalanick was a member of a panel advising Trump on economic issues. Kalanick soon promised that Uber would create a $3-million legal defense fund to help drivers affected by the travel ban. Within days, he quit the president’s advisory panel and slammed the travel ban in a memo to staffers.

Google's new 'Style Ideas' Image Search tool brings fashion to your phone Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/13 11:47am PDTApr 13, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 32 Share on Twitter Total Shares56 News Google has been rolling out a series of updates to its Image Search platform on mobile devices, and the latest addition includes tools to make coordinating outfits and researching fashion a bit easier. Now with 'Style Ideas' Google will show you a series of images related to the product in use. These new tools work in conjunction with the the Similar Items changes rolled out earlier this week, which provide links to other consumer items when looking at an image of a product, sort of like Google Shopping. Similar Items relies on identifying the items in an image to provide you with close matches. For example, if you search for a pair of sunglasses and like the shoes the model is wearing, you can see what they might be — though it isn't always right. The new Style Ideas tool compliments this. When you go to search for that jacket or bag you've been waiting to get, not only will you be shown other items similar to it, you'll also be able to see a bunch of examples of the item in use. Check out what that hat looks like with that belt you have, or you can see if that blue suit would make you look too much like a sailor with those black shoes. It might not be useful for everyone, but if you are into fashion or just happen to be looking for a new look, it's a pretty slick tool.   The recent trend towards commercialization in Google's image search continues apace, but this may at least fill a void for anyone who took a similar effort  to research their future purchases manually. Either way I, for one, welcome our fashionable new robot overlords.

Photo / 123RF.com When we think about Google and health, we usually think about patients searching online for health information. But you may be surprised that some doctors Google you. An Australian survey of how doctors use social media found about 16% (about one in six) had searched for online information about a patient, with roughly similar results from studies in the US and Canada. This raises several ethical concerns. For instance, what if your doctor's search through your Facebook, blog or Twitter feeds revealed aspects about your lifestyle, like drug or alcohol use, you didn't tell your doctor directly? What if that information influenced your access to surgery? Why doctors Google patients Some doctors say they Google their patients to gather more information about them or to discover the "truth". Armed with that information, they say they can better care for their patients and improve their health. For instance, a doctor may see a patient with depression's online account of wanting to end his life; the doctor might see that as an opportunity to take action and prevent a bad outcome. Or a doctor may find out about adolescent high-risk behaviour they are not likely to talk about, like drug abuse or risky sexual behaviour, and see that as an opportunity to protect them from harm. Alternatively, some doctors Google their patients out of curiosity, voyeurism or simply habit. Continued below. Related Content Auckland timber business backs staff loans to beat payday lenders Take extra care on roads thanks to Cyclone Cook, say police John Drinnan: When does plain talk become hate speech? This raises the issue of when a legitimate professional concern tips over into behaviour that's unnecessary and "creepy". To Google or not is an issue doctors admit to grappling with. In an Australian survey, when doctors were asked if it was appropriate for doctors to look up publicly available information about a patient, almost 43% said no and around 40% were unsure. Breaching trust When a doctor searches online for information about a patient without consent, their role changes from someone who works with the patient to someone who observes and spies on them. From a patient's viewpoint, this is likely to destroy trust between the two, as it shows a lack of respect. Patients can also be directly harmed when doctors act on information they find online. If a doctor sees an online photo of a patient waiting for a liver transplant drinking alcohol when they shouldn't be, patients risk missing out on receiving a new liver. Then there's the issue of whether the information is recent or relevant. In the case of the liver transplant dilemma, we might not know when the photo of the liver transplant patient was taken; it is not proof the patient is drinking now. Doctors, like the rest of us, also cannot be sure online information is accurate. For instance, more than 50% of adolescents admit posting false information on social media. To act or not to act? Deciding to search for information about their patients online is not the end of the matter. Doctors also need to decide whether to admit Googling and whether to act on the information they find. Doctors are legally required under mandatory reporting laws to report information they have viewed relating to child abuse and neglect. But if they act on inaccurate information, that can harm the patient and others. If they don't act on the information they find, they could be liable for not trying to protect the patient. In the end, doctors need to satisfy themselves that they have good reason to take action (or not take action) based on weighing up the likely benefits and harms. While there may be some justification for looking at patient information online when it relates to child safety, for adult patients, it's a different matter. For adults, it would be easier and more respectful to just ask them. What can we do? Regardless of any ethical concerns, how realistic is it for doctors to stop Googling their patients? Using Google is so common (globally, we use it to make 3.5 billion searches a day) that it has become the default way we find out information online. Many doctors also don't think Googling a patient is an invasion of privacy. Patients should be aware that their doctor can see and use the information they put online. To safeguard their privacy, patients can adjust their privacy settings and be careful of what they post. Perhaps there should be policy on the need for doctors to be open about Googling their patients. And, before they act on any information, patients should have an opportunity to refute or explain that information. If this doesn't happen, we will see an continual erosion of trust between doctor and patient.

These new changes include Google Smart Lock, better settings for enabling notifications, and a “Works with Nest” section that showcases compatible smart home devices… The biggest change for all Nest users is the addition of Google Smart Lock. Now, instead of having to remember your password when logging into the application, you will be able to sign in by authenticating yourself using the Google Account signed into your device. Nest Cam users are also getting a pretty big update when it comes to controlling notifications. Although users were already able to get notifications when their cameras noticed motion or possibly a person, the settings to turn these specific features on or off were a little difficult to setup. With the update, things are a lot more straightforward and easier to control. Lastly, there is now a “Works with Nest” section within the Nest application’s settings menu. Here users will be able to easily see what smart home appliances work with the Nest ecosystem as well as connect their Nests to the smart devices that they already have running in their homes. Below is the full changelog: The Nest app supports Google Smart Lock, letting you login to your Nest app without needing to remember your password. Nest Cam lets you set notifications for motion activity, person alerts (with a Nest Aware subscription), or both. Family members can set their own notification settings. Discover new Works with Nest partner products through the in-app catalog. The update is rolling out now and can be found on the Google Play Store. If it hasn’t reached your device yet but would like to install it now, you can download the latest version from APKMirror. Full instructions on sideloading applications can be found here.

If a certain product has caught your eye but you don’t know what to pair it with, Google Image Search now has the answer. During my testing I found this feature works for both male and female fashion searches. So it can be used to find shoes to match your favorite bag, or a tie to match your favorite suit. The announcement of this feature comes just days after Google introduced “similar items” suggestions for fashion searches. As of this week, Google Image Search is capable of recommending similar items based on the one being searched for. Google provided a detailed set of criteria to meet in order for products to be included in “similar items” suggestions. The company provided no such information as to how suggestions are chosen for this new “style ideas” feature.

The Burger King spot — perhaps the first aimed specifically at extending brand reach through the newfangled voice-activated entertainment modules — garnered the fast-food chain oodles of free publicity. The ads debuted during the late-night Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel shows. Burger King and Google battled for hours on Wednesday, with the tech titan angling to short-circuit the edgy ad. At first the search giant seemed to gain the advantage when it reprogrammed its digital assistant to ignore the “Hey, Google” comment. But then Burger King changed up the voice in three different versions and scored what appears to be a clear win. SEE ALSO Google hijacks Burger King's Whopper ploy 0:0 Score one for the tech nerds. A TV spot for... The follow-up spot managed to “100 percent trigger the smart speaker technology,” said a Burger King spokeswoman. The “Hey Google, what is a Whopper sandwich” question in the commercial triggered the Google Assistant to read Burger King’s Wikipedia page. Google on Thursday did not respond to questions for comment on the ad or whether it would take any legal action against the burger chain. The Burger King spokeswoman said that as of late Thursday the company hadn’t heard from the tech giant. But the situation may be at an impasse. Burger King said it has no plans to continue airing its Whopper ad.

The pitchman in Burger King's brief advertisement played off that brevity by noting he just didn't have enough time to list all "the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich" — so instead, he simply pulled the camera near and closed with a question addressed to the viewers' home device: "OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?" The idea was that if the search company's smart speaker (and possibly future sentient overlord) Google Home happened to be listening nearby, it would then answer the question with a makeshift promo for the burger -- an explanation of Burger King's signature item. And there is video proof the stunt indeed worked like a charm ... ... for a little while, that is. You see, two problems cropped up pretty quickly. First off, Business Insider notes the ad sent Google Homes directly to Wikipedia, which -- as high school syllabuses across the country will warn you -- is not always a reliable source of accurate information. Enterprising trolls all but immediately took to the Whopper page to make some rather clever (if dubious) edits. Hence the toenail clippings. Also, according to Gizmodo, this short-lived description: "The 'Whopper' is the worst hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King." And this one (emphasis ours): "The Whopper is a burger, consisting of a flame-grilled patty made with 100% medium-sized child with no preservatives or fillers, topped with sliced tomatoes, onions, lettuce, pickles, ketchup, and mayonnaise, served on a sesame-seed bun." Soon the company caught wind of the mischief and locked the page with a neutral definition, Gizmodo says. Then there was another problem: The New York Times reports Burger King didn't consult Google on the campaign ahead of time. Within hours, the tech company put a stop to the central shtick of the ad, changing its device so that Burger King's question — as it is uttered in the commercial — would no longer wake it. Google disabled the voice command for Burger King's commercial 😂😂 (it previously worked) pic.twitter.com/xDWF4wDS1Z— Niv Dror (@Nivo0o0) April 12, 2017 The Financial Times explains how the company likely made the tweak: "What we have learnt about Google Home, at least, is that the internet group does know how to switch off a particular voice trigger when it wants to, probably by checking an audio 'fingerprint' against a blacklist in the cloud before allowing a response." This may pose further problems for the commercial, which Business Insider says is running on at least a half-dozen channels in several major cities. At any rate, the commercial's ploy and its deactivation nabbed Burger King some attention and served as a reminder for us all: It might be that eventually the real achievement isn't the fact our devices talk to one another — as they briefly did in this case — but rather that we can still get them to shut up at all.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Home can check flight status, plan trips with Google Assistant By Ida Torres - April 13, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Planning trips, whether for personal reasons or for business can both be exciting and taxing (sometimes at the same time). If you’re busy doing other things and Google Home is just there, waiting to help you out, you can now get it to help you plan your next trip. Just by using the trigger words “Ok Google” or “Hey Google”, you can now find out the latest flight prices and have your digital assistant track your target place or country, and even inform you what are the things you can do there when you finally travel. First off, you would need to turn on your Personal results in Google Home to get information on your already existing flights. You would have to sign in to the same Google account that you used to set up your Google Home, and therefore your Google Assistant. Now you can use the digital voice assistant to ask questions like, “How much are flights to _______?” or to give it a direct command like “Find me a flight to _________”. You can get as specific as you can with dates or times or schedules. If you already have some flights saved in your email, then you will also be able to use Google Assistant to track it and ask questions like “When is my upcoming flight?” or “Is my flight on time?” You can also even track multiple flights. And to prepare for your trip, you can ask Google Home for a list of fun things to do in wherever you are going. The flight tracker is actually something that Google Flights can already do for you, but this time, you will be able to use voice commands to help you get information or make plans. However, you still can’t book through it and you’d have to use your computer or mobile browser to do so.

Yesterday GOOG: 823.56 -0.76 Should Google offer a dark theme on all of its apps? [Poll] Justin Duino - Apr. 13th 2017 6:34 pm PT @jaduino Apps & Updates Android Google poll View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Android is all about customization and allowing users to change the operating system to fit their style. For this reason, custom builds of Android allow for users to enable dark themes throughout the operating system and some app developers have also built dark themes into their apps. Although it isn’t live in the YouTube mobile app, today we did see the option pop up allowing for a dark theme on the desktop. Do you think Google should build dark themes into all of the company’s applications? Earlier this year, Google decided to change up the Google Play Movie application’s design by switching to a dark background. According to our comments section, this was a change that was widely loved by users. Unfortunately, though, instead of offering the choice between dark and light themes, Google only offered the default dark background. Other applications, such as Twitter and Pocket Casts, let the user choose how they would like the app to look. By simply going into the settings menu or popping open the side hamburger menu, users can choose to either keep the default light look or switch to a dark theme. Do you think Google should offer a dark/night theme in all of the company’s applications? Answer the poll below and let us know your thoughts in the comments!

Dan Costa: Welcome to Fast Forward, part of an ongoing conversation about living in the future. My guest today is Mamie Kanfer Stewart, the founder of Meeteor and a meeting expert. Meeteor is a company that makes meetings more effective. We're going to talk about the future of work, of meetings, and new interfaces for the workplace. Mamie, thanks so much for coming by. Mamie Kanfer Stewart: Thank you so much for having me today. Thanks so much for coming on. Let's talk a little bit about Meeteor and about productivity. I read that you grew up having productivity on your mind, that you were sent off to school every day with the quote: "Have a productive day." What is the origin of that? Growing up I remember by dad leaving the house right before I was off going to school and always saying, "Have a productive day" as he ran out of the house. Of all the things that a parent can say to their child, and I have children now and that's not what I say to them, but that's what my dad said to me, and it really stuck that every day was about doing something productive, moving yourself, moving your life, whatever it was, forward. I actually started my first business when I was in 5th grade. Was it a meeting planning business? Productivity software? It was not. It was not, but it was the same concept of I can do this better than how it's being done. It was a summer camp. I didn't like going to summer camp. For anyone else there who didn't like summer camp, I totally feel your pain, and I was like I can do this better. I scheduled everything out, I hired all the staff, I coordinated all the programming, and made it run really smoothly. I knew I could do it better. The idea of productivity to me is the same thing. No matter what you're doing, there's probably a more efficient, more effective way to do it. So you come up with Meeteor. I think everybody understands the need there. Everybody hates meetings. Everybody complains about meetings. Meetings waste a ton of time. You approach the situation you go, "You know what? I can fix that." Talk a little bit about how Meeteor works. We have a couple components to Meeteor. The primary component is our software. The origin of Meeteor actually comes out of my family business. I should have said that because my dad is a wonderful person, we have a family business, it's called GOJO. Purell is our claim to fame, Purell hand sanitizer. I got my first life experience as an adult inside of our family business. Meetings there were run extremely smoothly and very well, always an agenda, always follow-up items, very clear. When I went out to the real world after that I was like, whoa, this is not how the rest of the world works. Meeteor was built as a technology on the practices at GOJO. I was like we can do this through technology. Now that the world has evolved and there's so much happening online, why are we doing this in paper form when we can do it online? The core component is our technology, which helps you plan a thoughtful agenda, take clear notes that are articulated out as tasks, decisions, and learnings, and then manage all of that follow-through. You have the great meeting conversation and that leads into great action. We also offer consulting services because changing how people work can be tough business, and it's great for one manager to change their team, but it's better if a whole company can change, so we'll help you do that, and then we do kinds of skill-building workshops and webinars and all kinds of stuff to help people develop their own skills around meetings. So let me tell you how I do meetings. I send out a meeting invite in Outlook I and in the body of it I'll have an outline of we're going to talk about x, y, and z. Then there'll be a discussion as the fourth point. How does Meeteor make that better? Number one, a meeting agenda is not the same thing as a list of things that you're going to do in the meeting. This is like the number one, if you're going to take away one thing from this conversation, this is it. Start by figuring out, why are we having this meeting and what are we going to achieve? We often are good at putting things like, "We're going to discuss this, we're going to review that, we're going to come up with this," but what we don't do is say, "At the end of this meeting, what will we have achieved? What will be different in the world because we've achieved this particular outcome?" If you know that at the end of this meeting we're going to have a list of ideas for further consideration, or we're going to have a decision on this topic, then you can plan the agenda accordingly and you'll know at the end of the meeting if it was a good use of your time. Figuring out what the agenda items are, what you're going to do is good, but start with the whole result you want to achieve first. Meetings also reflect the cooperate culture. I think that's probably why you have the consulting business, because the tool alone isn't necessarily going to change the behavior. Can you talk a little bit about changing hearts as well as minds? Yes. Company culture is huge and messy and complicated, but meetings are one of the levers you can pull if you want to change company culture. Almost everyone in your company will attend meetings. They are where human dynamics and power and authority and all those stuff kind of comes out, and there are rituals and practices that you can really control in that setting. If you're attending a bunch of meetings and you don't feel like it's a good use of your time, that impacts how you feel about your company. It affects how you feel about your colleagues who are wasting your time, how you feel about this company where you're overly stressed because you have so much to do and you don't have time to do your "real" work because you're too busy sitting in these meetings that are not "real" work. If you plan a thoughtful agenda and you invite the right people to your meetings, suddenly now you've shifted and created a much bigger sense of respect that, "Oh, I'm invited to this meeting because there's a purpose to this meeting, there's a reason I need to be here, the person who invited me is being thoughtful about it." That's one of the human sides that can change. There's a whole bunch of others. I mean like inside of the meeting. When you think about there's one person who's always dominating the conversation, you're like, "How do I control that one person and get them to quiet down?", or, "How do I get the quieter people to speak up?" We have a practice called Norms. In our meeting template in Meeteor, when you're filling out more than just the description box in Outlook, but you're actually filling out the questions that help you get to a thoughtful agenda. One of them is around Norms. What are the behaviors that you want to promote in this meeting? How do you expect people to behave? You could have a Norm that says, "Quieter voices please speak up, louder voices please step back." Then when you're facilitating the meeting everyone's seen that that's a Norm for this meeting, and then as the meeting facilitator, or really anyone in the meeting, you can say, "I've noticed we haven't had our quieter people speaking up, and since that was one of our Norms, I'd like to make some space for the quieter people to speak up." You're using your agenda-building practice to create expectations for behavior, and then you can then apply those in the meeting and help facilitate. You don't have to be the weird meeting leader who's sitting there thinking, "How do I get that person to stop talking. I don't want to just say 'shut up', and I also don't want to call on someone out of the blue and just say 'Mamie, what do you think?' and put someone on the spot and make them feel awkward." I do that all the time. I think making it transparent, making it in advance and so that everybody sees that it's not personal is a good idea. I'm not telling anybody to shut up, I'm not telling anybody to speak up, I'm saying these are the standards we all agreed on in advance, so you're all on the same page. Exactly. And it helps people become more aware when you have Norms. Another one we like to use a lot is to use a back burner or a parking lot. Say, "If an off-agenda topic comes up, let's put it on the back burner and talk about it later." People will start to realize that they're raising issues that are off topic and they'll either stop doing it or they'll acknowledge it when they're saying it. "I have an idea, I know it's a back burner topic, I just want to put it to the side," and they'll self-regulate. Whereas if you don't have that practice you're just not even aware that you're doing some behaviors, so creating those Norms and making them explicit amongst the whole team can really help change that cultural dynamic. Interesting. We've got a question from our audience. Audience: Does your platform use chatbots at all? Ooh, interesting. We do not use chatbots inside of our app, but we have a Slack integration that is coming out before the end of this month. And we do have what we call our Meeteor bot, and you can talk to him, her, we haven't decided, gender neural, non-gendered. You can talk to Meeteor bot and you can plan your meeting agenda, you can take notes, all kinds of stuff within Slack using that kind of bot experience. That's very cool. There's a lot of productivity software out there. There's great chat applications, there's great to-do list managers, all those different things. You've decided to focus on the meeting itself. Why did you go after the meeting space and try and fix that? In a large part because there are really good tools for lots of other things. We have an integration with Slack coming out soon, we have one with HipChat, we have with Outlook, and coming out with Google soon. So there are a lot of great tools already and we don't want to replace those, but the other collaboration tools are missing out on this thing around meetings. On average people spend, well, managers can spend about like 40% of their time in meetings. That's a lot of time to be spending in meetings and not have a software tool to help you do that and use that time effectively. When we looked at the other products on the market, we saw that there were great tools for general collaboration, online document sharing, or task management, but what was missing was this focus on meetings. Our platform is actually much bigger than meetings, so we have a full, integrated task system. If you think about your day as how I spend my time, I have things I do by myself and I have things that I do with a group. The things I do by myself are tasks, the things I do with a group are typically meetings of some sort or another, but I need a seamless way for all of this activity to flow. When tasks come out of a meeting, if I have to write them down by hand or I get them in an email, then I have to copy and paste them into my task app, and then that's where I manage them, and then at the next meeting somebody's asking me did I do that task from that other meeting, it's just kind of messy. What our system's trying to do is streamline this process so that your whole day is in one single space. Whether they're tasks that you're just managing for a project, whether it's tasks that come out of a meeting, it's all in one place. We're not totally trying to replace all those other tools because they're really good, but we're trying to find ways to help streamline the work flow. Yeah. And there's so many tools on the market right now. So many. Just here at PCMag we're using Asana, we're using Slack, we're using our own personal to-do lists. Then we're using Google Calendar, we're using Google Tasks. It's amazing how many tools are being brought into the workplace. How does Meeteor slide into that? You've got integrations soon with Slack, what about some of the other integrations? This was a good learning as a business person, that Calendar is king when it comes to meetings. That we cannot compete. If we're not inside people's Calendars, it's really, really hard for people to even think about planning an agenda somewhere else. So integrations are huge. We're seeing it all over the place. Products like Zapier where you can connect apps that don't actually connect, that's where we're going. We don't want to go to a billion different places, we just want everything to flow seamlessly, and the more our product can talk to each other, the more effective we are as users and the better value experience we get out of them. To some extent, having one humongo app is also not the answer. We can see what happens when products get too complicated with bells and whistles and trying to do everything, so having more specialized apps that talk to each other I think is really the optimal solution. Is there a target market for your product? Are you looking at small businesses, medium businesses, does it scale all the way up into enterprises? Where's your sweet spot? If you have meetings, we are here for you. If you have meetings, we are here for you. We don't really differentiate. Our product works with organizations of all different sizes, teams of all different sizes. You can work by yourself on our app and not have any of your colleagues in it, or you can put 100 or 200 or 500 of your best friends in. It doesn't really matter, it's built to scale. We talked a little bit about chatbots and about AI and the future of work and sort of the audio input. That audio component, right now all this is being done on screens with keyboards, but when you add audio, audio seems like a fundamental part of the meeting process, there's some really interesting things you could do there. Yes. Typing in general is one of the hardest ways to input information, and it's one of the reasons why meeting notes are often so terrible is because nobody wants to take notes. Taking notes even typing is kind of awkward, most people prefer to take notes by hand. But it feels like there's a better way to do this with the rise of products like Google Home and Alexa and Siri, that at some point typing up meeting notes will be a thing of the past, and what we'll really do is be talking and saying, "Alexa, capture this decision," or, "Alexa, make this to-do for me," or, "Siri, make this to-do for me," and it will generate our meeting notes and generate our tasks for us and we won't have to type them in. It seems so logical. This show itself is going to be recorded as a video, we're going to have a transcript that's going to be made, and then that's going to serve as the text-based transcript for the show. All of that's automatic. I'm not going to re-type everything that we said on camera, and yet in a meeting that's basically what we have to do. Well, the tough part is that people don't want to be recorded. You want to have a safe space. If you're saying things that you're like, "This might be a good idea, I'm not 100% sure," or like, "I think I remember these are the numbers, but I'm not 100% sure," if you're not comfortable speaking your mind at a meeting because you're worried this is going to be memorialized forever and there's going to be a transcript and anyone in the company's going to be able to find out what I said and point back into history and say, "You said that thing," that feels super uncomfortable. Finding the balance between capturing audio information, transcribing it, making it available and continuing to keep a safe space where people can brainstorm or share perspectives that might be minority perspectives and where they get pushback, that's a fine dance that we're going to have to do in the workplace. Even if it was just creating a summary, and say, "Okay, there's no microphone on for 45 minutes, but the last two minutes we're going to go down on the record and this is what we want to commit to." That in itself could be pretty amazing and far better than emailing around everybody's notes after the meeting. And that's a practice we recommend right now. If you don't want to take notes in your meeting, that's fine, reserve the last five minutes to do what we call a wrap-up where you ask the group, "Okay, what are our next steps? What are the key takeaways that we want to make sure, like any information we want to make sure other people know about? What are the decisions we've made, and what are the action items and who's going to do them by when?" Just those moments, the last couple minutes where you capture that information, send it by email, put it in our system somewhere, you actually had to do a lot of things. One, you've now clarified what the meeting accomplished and you don't walk out of the meeting going, "Why did we have that meeting? What did we just decide?" You've created some clarity and made people feel really good because that was a good use of their time, you got to some outcomes, and you've now captured them so that they're on record, people can access them who weren't in the meeting. There's so many good things. It will just be a total boost when it can be done via audio instead of typing. What are your feelings on teleconferencing, the video communications? We can now do it, every laptop has the camera, we have the connections, everybody can find each other on Skype or on Google Hangouts, and yet I almost never do those types of meetings. You never do them because you're not with colleagues around the world? No, they're everywhere and I've done it ... You just prefer the phone? I think I prefer the phone. Interesting. We love audio. I mean I love all kinds of meetings, but I actually really do like where you can see people. I feel like it's really hard to totally be immersed in something when you can't see the other person. It's really easy to get distracted, and you don't always get to see their expressions and things like that. It's hard when it's a huge group. We're about 12 people, we're in five different countries in our business, my colleagues are in five different countries. So we do a lot of meetings by Skype or Google Hangouts, and it's not the same as being in person, but it's way better than audio where you just don't really connect at all. That's where the future of meetings are. We have TelePresence in my family's business, and that is a whole other thing, but it's like ginormous screens and even that is so helpful. I feel like I see all their hairs out of place- Like a proprietary system that's rolled out? Yes. So a high-end one, not just ... It's super high-end. ... Skype or ... No, no, super high-end where it's like video conferencing, but it's like on crack. It makes a huge difference than seeing little tiny boxes of people's faces. I think we're moving in that direction, which is a good thing because you see body language. Especially if you're working with people who have different cultural backgrounds than you, where English might not be their first or native language and you're trying to understand each other, seeing body language, seeing their facial expressions, all of those little pieces help to build relationships, it helps to build understanding, so it's good stuff. You obviously love meetings. I do love meetings. You have a business about meetings, I think that comes across. What meetings do you hate? I do not like any meetings where I don't get an agenda in advance and I don't know why I'm going. That doesn't happen that often because most people that I meet with now- They've got Norms and they know better. Oh, they know, they know better. Actually I went to a meeting not that long ago where they sent us a pre-reading packet. It was like 60 pages long. It was a two-day board meeting. I did all of the reading because that's what good board members do and good meeting participants do, and I showed up and the first part of the meeting was great. Then we got into the next section and the woman who was leading it basically repeated everything that was in the pre-reading. And I was like, "Why? Why are you doing this? We read the material. Why can't we just be in discussion now?" Those kinds of meetings, not good. If you think about the time of the people who are in the meeting, if you're gathering five people for half an hour, it's really hard to get those five people to spend half an hour together all at once. Finding the calendars lining up, scheduling, it's complicated stuff. Getting 30 minutes from each of those five people individually, really easy. If you're just going to present information in your meeting, like don't. Just don't. Send it to them as a memo, meet with people one-on-one. If you're going to bring people together, take advantage of the fact that you have those five brains in the room at the same time and they can engage with each other. Do as much as you can outside the meeting to share information so that your time in the meeting can be for engagement. Those are the kinds of meetings that I really like, where I get to talk and have fun and be with people. Not so fun if I'm just sitting there, listening, and being like, "Why? Why are we doing this?" I'm going to send this interview to everybody in the office just because I feel exactly the same way. Another question from our audience. Audience: How do you get people to show up on time? That's a good question. That's a really tough, tough question. One is start the meeting on time without them and don't go backwards. We have a concept we call feathering in. Let me make the caveat, if the person is a senior person who is absolutely required to be in this meeting, you should wait for them to start. Actually, instead of starting and then recapping them, if they're going to be just a few minutes late, give everyone who's sitting around waiting and say, "Okay, we're not going to start until Mamie arrives, so if you want to be on your devices, fine. If you want to go to the bathroom, get a cup of coffee, fine. We're just going to wait." Let people choose how to use that time. Don't start and then recap. If it's someone who is not essential to making that decision or it's not a senior person, start your meeting without them, and when they come in, don't stop and then restart. Just say, "Glad you could join us, have a seat, this is where we are in the agenda," and keep going. If they have a question, they can ask, but you really want to just push through. If you create this norm that my meetings start on time and if you're not here you're going to miss something, too bad for you, people will start to move towards making sure that they're on time. The other thing you can do is if it's someone who's chronically late, like a specific person, have a talk with them. Ask them, "What's going on that you're constantly running late?" Maybe they're scheduling meetings back to back, which is not always their fault, but it's really hard, Google and Outlook I love you, but meetings should not be 30 minutes long with no time to walk down the hall or go to the bathroom. Most people don't schedule their meeting for 25 minutes, so that can be one reason why people are walking in late. Plan to start your meeting a few minutes late so you have time to get settled in. If you have a jam-packed agenda, give yourself a couple extra minutes in the time you're requesting so you don't have to feel rushed if you start at 9:05 or 9:07. In my mind, if you're showing up late to meetings, it's not all that different than turning in work late. Meetings are part of your job. It's how work gets done, the same way that doing tasks is how work gets done, so if someone's chronically showing up late to meetings, have a chat with them and try and figure out what's going on. Is there something you can help, a roadblock, something you can do differently, and if not, let them know that this is not an acceptable way to be at work. Good answer. Another question from our audience. Audience: How do you train people to get comfortable with doing meetings in a different way? Is there an online guide that goes with Meeteor? Yes. Definitely come to our website, we have a lot of blog articles, blog.meeteor.com. Meeteor has two 'e's, M-E-E-T, like you're in a meeting. We have a number of articles about how to introduce meeting practices into your team, different ways, either doing it by sharing some of our blog articles for a particular practice, having a meeting about your meetings, might sound a little bit weird, but that's one thing you can do is to have a meeting and send out the agenda to say, "Hey guys, I think we should talk about our meeting practices and like think as a group what's working and what's not and what do we want our meetings to be like." So check out our blog articles, we talk about all of this. We will probably do a webinar or a workshop on this topic, so if you want to be informed of that, you should subscribe to our blog so you'll get all the notifications for our upcoming events. You talked about meeting length, every meeting shouldn't be 30 minutes. I find my default meeting length tends to be an hour, which is usually way longer than I need to actually accomplish what needs to happen? What is the ideal time for a meeting? What should people strive for? There's not exactly an ideal time for a meeting. It's really about what do you need to get done in the meeting. When I say don't just do for 30 minutes, it's really about thinking how much time do people need to get in and get out of this meeting? When you're planning your agenda ... So you start with, what am I going to accomplish in this meeting? And then, how are we going to get there? What are the things we're going to do? Think about how much time you need for each of those, and the more thought and detail you put into it, the more accurate your meeting planning will be and the more you'll know how much time you'll need. For example, if you want to have some reflections on the pre-reading. You sent out this four page report and you want to have a couple of minutes at the beginning of the meeting for people to ask questions. If you think, all right, there's going to be eight people in this room, and if each person talks for approximately one minute, that's eight minutes. Now you're starting to think about how much time you're going to need. Now, if you were initially not really thinking that way, you might put that and 17 other things into your agenda, and then suddenly realize, "We're going to have 30 seconds for each of these items, we're not actually going to have time." In a 30 minute meeting with five people, assuming your first five minutes are getting settled, your last five minutes are doing that wrap up we talked about, you really only have 20 minutes in the middle. For five people, that means each person's going to talk for four minutes. That's not that much time, so be really careful about what you're trying to get accomplished in that meeting and plan it out. It's okay to have a 45 minute meeting or a 50 minute meeting or a 20 minute meeting. They don't have to be 30 minutes or an hour. You want to make it according to what you need to get done. Don't accept the defaults. Totally. Because the defaults are always going to take up more of your time than you probably need. I want to know your thoughts on the idea of laptops in meetings, which is a bit of a problem for PC Mag-ers because we have a hard time putting down our laptops and moving away from our keyboards. At the same time, you want to have access to data, you want to have access to information, you want to be able to take notes. So what's your take on laptops on the table in meetings? My feeling is if your meeting is a good meeting, people who are on their laptops will be doing things relevant to the meeting and not checking email or Facebook or anything else. If your meeting is not worth their time, that's why they're messing around with their laptop. I have no position on laptops good or bad. If you find that people are bringing their laptops and they're not actually participating in the meeting, that's when you have a problem. But if you make your meetings good and they're the right people talking about the right stuff, they shouldn't be doing those things. This is another reason why having that Alexa would be really helpful in the office because now you don't have to have your laptops to look up information. You can say, "Alexa, what were our Twitter engagement last month?" or, "What were expenses on a, b, and c last month?" and Alexa will mine the data and tell you, and you don't need someone on their laptop digging around for it. That's really ... I think it's a super exciting space. To be the onboard brain for the company and just be able to answer those simple questions that you can pull out of a spreadsheet, but you'll have that voice-driven interface so that you can all hear it at the same time. Is that a space you think you want to go to with Meeteor, or are you going to just partner up with some of those companies? I would love to, but it's going to be through a partnership. We're not building that kind of capability, but what we are doing is building the data set that's not around spreadsheets and things like that, but really around the knowledge components, decisions that are being made, learnings that are being shared, tasks that are happening, those kinds of things. I would love to partner with a company who wants to bring that kind of audio and algorithmic stuff into the meeting space. All right. Maybe some of our listener. We've got another question from the audience. Audience: Do you think you'll ever use VR or 360 cameras with your platform? Oh. That would be super cool. I'm very excited by where that's going. I actually think it would be super cool to have an avatar of myself that could then be in a virtual meeting room with all my colleagues and would see my facial expressions and know my hand movements. I'm not sure how that would play out into our platform, if it's something that we would eventually integrate with, but I think it's a great movement for where video conferencing is going. Much better than just the flat screens since most of us have little tiny screens with lots of little, tiny boxes. I'm really super excited by the idea of VR. And the idea of also being able to see, being able to focus in different places in the room. You don't always need to see everybody at the same time, just follow who's speaking, or focus in on individual people while they have the floor. Absolutely. We try to do that now, but what ends up happening is somebody calls in on their cellphone, but then they have their computer and the things aren't linked, so they're talking, but you see the blank screen instead of their face. All that stuff will eventually go away and it will be much, much better. So personal productivity tips. Do you have anything that you personally do that helps you get a lot more done during the day? Because I suspect that you probably have more than one. I have a lot. Up front, I'm a huge GTD fan, I love David Allen, he's one of my heroes. The one thing that I think really changed my life when I started implementing was his two-minute rule. When you're going through your task list or you're going through your emails, if something's going to take you two minutes or less to do it, just do it then because it's going to take you longer to put it into your to-do list or come back to it later, and the amount of time that you save and the amount of things you get done is just awesome. My inbox went way down, I feel so good about checking a bunch of things off my list at once because it's just like, "Oh, I can do that, oh, I can do that," and just get it done. You've obviously made great progress in making meetings better. One of the things ... When I tried to run that two minute drill, I wind up sending out a lot of emails, and I swear they come back faster than I send them and I wind up getting more email coming back in. When will email get fixed? And when will we be able to manage this particular beast? I'm not sure that I have an answer for that one. I mean Slack has made a huge step forward in reducing the amount of email. Many teams, including mine, use Slack internally, and so our internal email has gone way down, but still with clients and customers we're working on external email. I'm not 100% sure what's going to happen with email. Maybe someday we'll just ... It'll disappear and we'll have little chips in our brains and we'll communicate telepathically and email will be gone, but until then keeping your inbox low makes a huge difference in how you feel about your productivity. Let's get to the closing questions, I ask this to pretty much everybody. Looking forward into the future, what technological trends concern you the most? What worries you the most? I have two little kids, and I'm not 100% sure this is a trend, but it's something I think about a lot, which is around privacy and your online self and life. Especially as a parent I try not to put so much stuff online about my kids, but I really have no idea what's going to happen in the future, and what am I setting them up for in a good or bad way because of the content that I'm putting online about myself that is somehow going to then affect them. The history of my parents is known to our family and friends, but to very few other people, but my kids, when they grow up, everything about me is online, and stuff I'm putting about them as little kids is going to be online. I just don't know where that's heading and that's very scary. Yeah. I think the idea of there's what you share, and then there's the secondary idea that it never goes anywhere. That it's always there and that there will always be pictures throughout your entire life. Restaurants you've eaten at, birthday parties you attended, the whole map of your life will be there and searchable in one way or another. Yup. It's really hard to contain. Yes. Yeah. And who has access to that information? It feels like it's constantly changing and evolving, and what companies can do with that information. Are they going to target my kids for certain things the way they target me for certain stuff? I just don't know and that is ... That's scary stuff. I feel like we have a big challenge to overcome as a country in thinking about the online security and safety and privacy. And globally too. Totally. You'd think there would be some kind of legal protections, but this is a global issue, and it sort of transcends borders. Absolutely. If that's the downside, what is the upside? What are you most excited and hopeful about in terms of technological trends? I don't know. That's a good question too. I'm really excited, just in general, about access to information. It's a little disappointing right now the way that we've become bubble-ized. We've all become in bubbles because of the way algorithms feed us information, but I think that there are companies who are starting to think about how do we stop that perpetual cycle, and the fact that we have access to information that we never had before is very exciting to me. The amount of good content that's being produced by people all over the world that I can now see and share and engage with is very, very exciting. Yeah. The business model of media is a little broken, and possible not sustainable. At the same time, as a consumer it's never been a better time to be alive. There's so much available and so much diversity, you just have to go out and find it a little bit because if you don't reach out for it, you're going to wind up being fed a Facebook feed that's based on whatever you like. Exactly. I think about that with my kids too, that at some point they'll be able to go online and find a course about anything they want to take, and we won't be limited by what our school's teaching them, what our neighborhood offers, or what time courses or classes are at. They'll just be able to go on and find people who have similar interests who want to learn the same thing, and the world's just open to them in a way that wasn't to me when I was a kid. It almost makes up for the fact that we don't have any privacy anymore. Almost. Is there one particular service or app or gadget that you use every day that just makes you feel wonder and makes you feel like you're living in the future? Sort of. I wear this ring, I have a couple of them actually. It's by Ringly and it connects to my phone, and I have it set so that if my kids' school or my husband or babysitter calls or texts me, it will flash and buzz. It's a little bit weird, but I don't like having my phone on me all the time. In meetings it's really distracting if it's just buzzing, buzzing, buzzing. I want to know if the really important people are trying to get a hold of me. This is my first piece of wearable tech. This is the first time I've ever seen somebody wearing that in the wild. Really? Yeah, we have tested them in the Lab, but it is I haven't seen them in real life. You're actually wearing that now just because it provides utility for your life. I love it. I wear it every single day. I have a couple different colors so I can mix it up, and people who know me are like "Oh, she's wearing a Ringly again" because I wear it all the time because I don't worry about missing a phone call. I feel like I have some freedom from my phone, and they're beautiful. They're a lovely piece of jewelry. I actually wanted to invent this way a long time ago, but I had no idea how to do it. I was just out of college and the first iPhone had come out and I was like, "Oh, I wish there was a way I could know my phone was ringing when it's in my purse," and I was really glad when Ringly came about. It's great because it's a filter. It serves as a filter so you don't have to pick up the phone every time, you don't have to look at it every time, but you've got that selective ... You can set your filter and only care about what's important to you, and that's pretty valuable. Exactly. And for me it's just my kids pretty much. But their app allows you to do whatever, there's tons of integrations. For you, if it's your calendar or if it's Twitter or something else, you can set it for that, and you now just get that freedom. You can know about what's important and you don't have to worry about everything else. See, I wish that was integrated into Fitbit. You can get notifications, but it would be great on a wearable so that you could wear it on your watch and you'd get the same type of filter, but not every text message you get, only the ones that you really care about. That's why I haven't got an Apple watch or any of those kinds of fancy watches yet because I'm like I actually don't want that kind of information so close to me all the time. I need to have some space from it. It's great to ... How can people find out more about you, more about Meeteor, and keep up-to-date with the product? Yeah. For me, go to mamieks.com, M-A-M-I-E-K-S, as in Sam, dot com. You can follow me on Twitter @mamieks. For Meeteor, go to meeteor.com, M-E-E-T-E-O-R, dot com. Follow us on Twitter @meeteorhq.

Google app v7.0 beta includes new Assistant Notification settings, plans redesign of Assistant Services directory, and hints at new device called "Bisto" [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/13 4:29am PDTApr 13, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 123 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares209 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Toggle Google Assistant Notifications 1.2 Prevent icons from being added with new app installs 1.3 Bug fix: No more crashing from swiping away cards 2 Teardown 2.1 Services are going to be easier to manage 2.2 code 2.3 A new device type called "Bisto" 2.4 code 2.5 code 3 Download The Google app went through a major version bump to 7.0 and began rolling out to the beta channel a couple of days ago. A bit of digging around turned up a few new settings, but nothing that explains why the version number went up on this release. Along with the new features, a teardown also raises some light on a few things we can look forward to in the future, including some vital improvements for Services accessed through Google Assistant and what may be a new type of device. If you're not part of the beta channel, you can grab the latest version of the Google app – now with fewer crashes – from APK Mirror. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Toggle Notifications for Google Assistant Toggle Auto-add app icons for new installs (Android O) Bug fix: No more crashing on card dismissals Toggle Google Assistant Notifications Google is working hard to make Assistant more useful and appealing to users, and that often means it will have to behave a little differently from one user to the next. Not only that, but it probably has to behave a little differently from one device to another, especially when they come in different form factors. The latest Google app update brings a little more configurability with a new setting for Assistant that allows users to toggle notifications on or off for their phones and Google Home devices. Here's the description: Receive notifications like weather updates on this device. Even if notifications are off, you'll still hear alarms and important updates. By default, the setting will be enabled on phones and disabled on Google Home. If you would like to change the setting, just go into the Google app Settings screen and then tap into the Assistant settings. You can switch between the Phone settings and Google Home with the dropdown at the top of the page, and then switch between Home units with another selector further down the page. Notifications toggles for Google Home (left) and phones (right) It's safe to assume that this refers to those low-priority items that silently slip into the notification list with current weather conditions, due dates for bills, and occasionally some important local news. At least that's how they usually present themselves on a phone. Google Home might be a different story, and that might make this a little more interesting. So far, Assistant on Google Home has only been known to become active when an alarm goes off or somebody interacts with it directly through voice commands or casting. The rest of the time, it stays quiet. Enabling this setting would seem to suggest that it could now (or soon) wake up from time to time to let you know it started raining outside or that the mayor of a nearby town was arrested for some pretty nasty things. (True story.) I've had the setting enabled for several hours on my Google Home, but there haven't been any notifications read aloud to me yet. I don't know if there just haven't been any events or if this isn't really supposed to be doing anything (yet). Prevent icons from being added with new app installs A couple of weeks ago, a teardown turned up a new setting destined for Google's launcher. Its purpose was to simply turn off the behavior that created icons on the home screen for freshly installed apps. That toggle is now live in the v7.0 update, but with a weird catch: It only works on Android O, or API 26, to be specific. Only users running a developer preview will be able to see the toggle for now. Readers of the teardown rightly brought up the point that the Play Store offers a similar setting. However, that toggle only applies to apps installed through the Play Store, not to those from other sources like the Amazon Appstore. Perhaps this is related to–or inspired by–the change in the way unfamiliar app installers are handled in Android O. Bug fix: No more crashing from swiping away cards If you installed v7.0.4 of the Google app and ventured into your Now stream, there's a pretty good chance you also tried to swipe away a card and witnessed the scene above. Yes, there was a bug in that release and it had the undesirable effect of crashing the home screen. Version 7.0.6, which is linked below, fixes the issue. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Services are going to be easier to manage After Google opened the gates for developers to build services for Assistant, there was a predictable flood of submissions attempting to get the attention of users. We're now staring at an unwieldy, disorganized list that's pretty hard to keep up to date with. Naturally, Google is moving to solve this by adding a few tools to make all of these services a little easier to sift through and use. First, services (referred to as "agents" by Google's developers) will be sorted into categories so you won't have to stumble through a list containing everything from food delivery services to games. <string name="agent_directory_category">Category</string> <string name="agent_directory_category_list_header">Categories</string> If you're still having trouble finding the service you want, you'll also be able to ask Assistant to help out. <string name="agent_directory_ask_prompt">Ask your Assistant</string> Once you're using a service and find that it's really good (or bad), you'll be able to give your feelings about it with a rating, feedback, or even report it if something is really not right about it. Ratings will obviously also be reflected in the directory of services so everybody will be able to ignore the ones that didn't live up to other peoples' standards. code <string name="agent_directory_rate_service_prompt">Rating</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_subtitle">Rate your experience with %1$s on Google Assistant</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_title_after_rating">Your rating</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_title_before_rating">Rate %1$s</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_five_stars_button">Five stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_four_stars_button">Four stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_three_stars_button">Three stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_two_stars_button">Two stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_one_star_button">One star</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_agent_avg_rating">%1$s star rating</string> <string name="agent_directory_agent_rating_menu_delete">Delete</string> <string name="agent_directory_agent_rating_menu_edit">Edit</string> <plurals name="agent_directory_a11y_user_rating"> <item quantity="other">Your rating %d stars.</item> <item quantity="one">Your rating %d star.</item> </plurals> <string name="agent_feedback_from_header_text">From</string> <string name="agent_directory_feedback_send">Send</string> <string name="agent_directory_report">Report service</string> <string name="agent_directory_report_agent_text"><u>Report service</u></string> Once you've chosen a few services that you like, you'll be able to add them to a personalized list. The term 'shortcut' is also used a few times and might be a way for users to attach their own custom names to services, and maybe even fill in some of the information for regular requests. <string name="agent_directory_my_services_header">My Services</string> <string name="agent_directory_shortcuts_title">Your %1$s shortcuts</string> <string name="agent_directory_shortcuts_subtitle">Customize your shortcuts for %1$s</string> <string name="agent_directory_shortcuts_create">CREATE</string> Most of this is pretty predictable stuff and was bound to happen eventually, and perhaps it should have been done a bit earlier. Nevertheless, as the infrastructure improves, so does the ecosystem. A new device type called "Bisto" Every once in a while, something really unusual comes up in a teardown... This is one of those times. There's a new device type listed among the strings in this update, and they refer to something known internally as "Bisto." This obviously has nothing to do with the British brand of foods, but instead refers to a device that is somehow distinct from other current products. code <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_android_tv">Android TV</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_bisto">Bisto</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_google_home">Google Home</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_nexus">Pixel</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_phone">Phone</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_wear">Android Wear</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_android_tv_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdAndroidTvCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_bisto_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdBistoCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_google_home_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdGoogleHomeCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_nexus_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdNexusCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_wear_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdWearCategory</string> The list of device types above shows that Bisto is going to be treated differently from Android TV, Google Home, Android Wear, a Google Pixel, and the general category of "phone." Of course, since this list already makes a distinction between the Pixel and a regular phone, we can't eliminate the possibility Bisto is another phone or a special release matching one of the other products. code <string name="bisto_device_notifications_pref_title">Spoken notifications</string> <string name="bisto_device_notifications_pref_summary">Notifications will be read aloud inside your headphones</string> from /res/xml/assistant_device_id_bisto_settings.xml <PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.PreferenceHolder android:key="@string/assistant_device_id_group_holder"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.MainScreenPreferenceCategory android:title="@string/assistant_settings_device_id_category" android:key="@string/assistant_device_id_bisto_preference_category"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.MainScreenDropDownPreference android:persistent="false" android:key="bistoDeviceId" /> <SwitchPreferenceCompat android:persistent="false" android:title="@string/bisto_device_notifications_pref_title" android:key="bistoNotifications" android:summary="@string/bisto_device_notifications_pref_summary" /> </com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.MainScreenPreferenceCategory> </com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.PreferenceHolder> </PreferenceScreen> The current manifestation involving Bisto is a single toggle that offers to read notifications aloud to the user through headphones. This means the product can at least support headphones, which only really eliminates Android Auto and other in-car products – many states and countries don't allow drivers to wear headphones. We can also surmise that Bisto includes a screen since this setting gives the option to read notifications through headphones, but likely shows them in some other way if the setting is disabled. In other words, it's probably not an audio-only device like Google Home. Since these are settings for Assistant, the final assertion we can make is that the device will obviously include Google Assistant. From that, we can also assume it will have a microphone and probably a speaker. Okay, those aren't strictly sure things, but the odds are in our favor. Unfortunately, that's about as far as the clues take us. It probably has more in common with a phone than it does with Google Home, and it's not going to be exclusive to a car... Bisto might be an entirely new category of hardware, a specially branded device from an existing category, or even just the name used internally for Android One devices with Google Assistant. It's too early to speculate much beyond that, but we'll definitely be on the lookout for more hints.

Cody Toombs It's certainly possible. There are a few variants of Glass roaming around, including a couple of models that are only available to partners and supposedly one that has no screen and operates a lot like Google Home. That last one can probably be ruled out because it lacks a screen, but I could see how some of the partners might want Google Assistant on their Glass units. I hope this isn't the case since it means we probably wouldn't get to confirm it for a long time. On the other hand, it's always possible (but unlikely, I think) that Google is thinking about taking another run at launching Glass. marcusmarcus2 Maybe it is for "Android Things" Isaac Fischer Guesses for Bisto: a Glass redux or a wall panel / standalone home control device. whispy_snippet Bisto = Bison? Guest You can change the notification setting for Google Home through the Google app the same way you can for the phone. When I go to settings through the Google app there's a toggle to select either my Pixel XL Assistant settings or Google Home Assistant https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cdb9430794930787147ba2eb5fe2032e0a4528b2dc567b1c549a034f441c1ef1.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9cec9c79b31aca40a0b7f0025450a895c74544e859fb60bae9c7d280e6ff1cce.png settings Cody Toombs Ahh, you're right. I don't know why I keep forgetting that, I even explained the layout in a teardown many months ago. Every time I see the dropdown indicator, I think it's used for collapsing the section below it, which makes no sense. DJ SPY We've been able to turn off and on the thing about a new app icon being added to the home screen, directly from the play store for ever. What's the point of that option being in the Google app now? F4LL0U7 Second paragraph of that section: "Readers of the teardown rightly brought up the point that the Play Store offers a similar setting. However, that toggle only applies to apps installed through the Play Store, not to those from other sources like the Amazon Appstore." mike shwilly How about song recognition? Or it will be classic Google waiting a whole year to present this "feature" with a new OS? Josh Flowers Seriously! I heard a song yesterday, pulled out the phone, "ok google -- what's this song?" --"I'm sorry, I can't do that yet." Instant thought: I've replaced a superior product with an inferior product. F4LL0U7 Why not just use the widget icon that you can add to your home screen? That still works. Josh Flowers Don't have a widget. I think I deleted 'Sound Search' when I had Google Now. Just re-installed, thanks...but bummed I have to do so. F4LL0U7 It's not the standalone Sound Search app that hasn't been updated in years. It's a widget that's part of the Google app itself. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b12d0cd106c2504e21827d19c9164f96401e390950988d2fa533f424eb61fa80.png Andrew Robotham No black status icons?

Fresh360 It may be all in my head but it seems that Assistant gives me more "bad" results and doesn't understand my voice inputs way more than plain ol Google Now...Especially with playing music thru GPM : ( Zach Mauch Bisto = Andromeda Confirmed!!!!! ;-) Kaden Gordon Says who? I mean, it makes some sense, but who said that? Callum Saunders I'm thinking that bisto is this reiteration of google glass that is audio only. I'd say maybe a take on apple's airpods but that include google assistant? This would tie into the partnership with sony to bring the high quality bluetooth audio to Android O. I imagine these will be bundled with the pixels to compensate for removing the headphone jack and this would be a way for them to market it as BETTER than the headphone jack. LondonLeedsFan I'm on beta for the Google app and other than getting Assistant, nothing in regards to layout or appearance has changed on any update on about 6 months? Czifra János And one new think on a video: https://youtu.be/bdw6oGYm6tI Willie Chalmers III Looks like you just got the server side switch for a feature that's been around for a month.

Even though Nexus 6 was launched almost three years ago, it looks like Google isn’t done with it yet. Worth mentioning is that the Android parent even announced that Nexus 6 will not receive any further operating system updates. However, Google Android Git proves the otherwise. Reports are showing that Google has been spotted testing a special Android 8.0 build that’s compatible with Nexus 6, but does this mean that Nexus 6 will receive Android 8.0? Sadly, this is highly unlikely since Google has publicly confirmed that Android 7.1.1 Nougat will remain Nexus 6’s operating system. Android 8.0 Nexus 6 Edition As previously mentioned, Google will not provide Nexus 6 with any future software updates. However, the Android parent has guaranteed that Nexus 6 is set to receive all of 2017’s monthly security updates. With that being said, it seems that the reason why Google’s is working on the Nexus 6 Android 8.0 build is to be able to test security updates. Everyone remembers last month’s security patch that somehow managed to cause Nexus 6’s Android Pay feature to malfunction. Google was even forced to roll out an operating system downgrade to Android 7.0 Nougat because it wasn’t able to fix the Android Pay issue via a OTA (over the air) fix. Google is definitely not looking to make the same mistake again and that’s why it first will test its security updates on the special build. Nexus 6 Nexus 6 might be almost three years old but this isn’t stopping customers from still buying it. The smartphone is considered as being a customer favorite since it brings impressive specs for a rather cheap price. The only problem regarding Nexus 6 is that it won’t receive any more updates, but this can be solved through the use of custom ROMs such as LineageOS. Nonetheless, Nexus 6 ships with a 5.96 inch AMOLED display that offers a high pixel resolution of 1440 x 2560 and a pixel density of 493 ppi. When it comes to hardware performance, Nexus 6 is powered by Qualcomm’s’ quad-core Snapdragon 805 CPU that’s been clocked at 2.7GHz Krait 450.

Google has started rolling out Android 7.1.2 Nougat to them. However, the update is not exclusive for Nexus 5X and it will also arrive to Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 6P and Nexus Player. In fact, Pixel C has received the major software update ahead of everyone else. Bug Fixes Android 7.1.2 Nougat is being regarded as an incremental maintenance update that is mainly focused on fixing bugs and enhancing the overall Android user experience with minor tweaks. Regarding bug fixes, the update takes care of the highly annoying pink banding of Nexus 5X’s camera footage. We should also mention that Android 7.1.2 Nougat also takes care of Google Pixel’s hardware malfunction that caused it to shutdown early. Tweaks and Features Alongside the aforementioned bug fixes, Android 7.1.2 Nougat also brings fingerprint gestures support to Nexus 5X. The feature allows Nexus 5X users to open up their notification panel by simply swiping on the fingerprint sensor. When it comes to tweaks, Nexus 5X owners should be happy to know that Android 7.1.2 Nougat enhances their Bluetooth connectivity. April Security Bulletin One of the best things about Google’s latest software updates is that they also tighten security. Each month Google launches a new security patch and Android 7.1.2 Nougat includes April’s update. The security bulletin is highly important because it takes care of some major vulnerability threats. With that being said, Nexus 5X owners should make sure to download the update ASAP. Android 7.1.2 Nougat Issues Usually when Google starts rolling out an update, some unexpected issues pop up such as extra battery drainage. Fortunately, Android 7.1.2 Nougat has been perfectly optimized and it doesn’t include any annoying issues. User reports are showing that Nexus 5X actually runs faster than normal once Android 7.1.2 Nougat has been installed. On another note, Nexus 6 and 9 owners shouldn’t expect Android 7.1.2 to come their way. Google has officially stopped supporting the aforementioned smartphones and this means that both of them will remain on Android 7.1.1 Nougat from now on. However, there are always custom ROMs such as LineageOS which are compatible with Nexus 6 and 9.

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. The year 2013 has been a fruitful one for smartphone lovers. The market was flooded with premium smartphones that are still selling well to this day. Not everyone is able to afford one of Samsung’s latest Galaxy S series smartphone and that’s why older smartphones are still popular. Even though many companies refreshed their smartphone offerings all throughout 2013, two of them stand out the most. We are talking about Nexus 5 and Moto X. Google and LG are the two companies behind Nexus 5 and obviously Motorola is the one that’s directly managing Moto X. Today we’re going to pin the two against each other and see what they have to offer. We should also add that Google used to collaborate with Motorola and create Nexus smartphones, therefore it’s going to be quite interesting to see how well Motorola’s smartphone fares against the LG made Nexus 5. Display Nexus 5 ships with a 4.95 inch True HD IPS+ display that offers a full HD pixel resolution of 1080 x 1920. LG has also made sure to coat the device’s display in Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which increases its shock resistance. On the other hand, Moto X has been fitted with a 4.7 INCH AMOLED panel that features a pixel resolution of 720 x 1280. Moto X’s display has also been coated in Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Specs LG and Google’s smartphone is powered by Qualcomm’s quad-core Snapdragon 800 CPU. The processor clocks at 2.3GHz Krait 400 and it is paired with an Adreno 330 graphics processing unit and 2GB of RAM. Moto X is also fueled by one of Qualcomm’s CPUs but a different model. Moto X uses Qualcomm’s dual-core Snapdragon S4 Pro CPU that clocks at 1.7GHz Krait 300 and that’s been coupled with an Adreno 320 graphics processing unit and 2GB of RAM. Verdict Even though Moto X is putting up a good fight, we have to give it to Nexus 5. The latter dominates in both the hardware and display departments with its more impressive performances. Even better, Nexus 5 has been kept up to date with all of Google’s software updates along the years and this gives it an advantage over Moto X.

Even though everyone might believe that Nexus 6P’s fate might not be so bright, Google is proving the otherwise. Ever since Google came out with its Pixel lineup, people started believing that Google is going to depart from the Nexus brand. Well this might be true for older smartphones such as Nexus 6 and 9 but Nexus 6P is an entirely different story. The Android parent is not able to reproduce the same amount of sales with the Pixel lineup in foreign countries as it is with Nexus 6P. Brand Recognition Google has done its best when it designed Pixel and Pixel XL. Both smartphones have been fitted with premium hardware that offers flawless performances. However, Google didn’t take one important thing into consideration. The Pixel brand doesn’t benefit from the same global recognition as Nexus does. From the looks of it, this is the sole reason why Nexus 6P is still being kept alive. The only other option that Google has is to put in motion a strong Pixel marketing campaign. This might sound like a rather simple task, but there’s a problem though. A new marketing campaign requires a large investment and Google isn’t one to spend money on marketing. Therefore, this leaves Nexus 6P as the main money bringer in foreign countries. Android 8.0 A couple of weeks ago rumors were pointing towards the fact that Google is developing Android Nougat’s successor. Google decided to prove that those rumors were real and uploaded the developer preview of Android 8.0. What’s interesting is that despite popular belief, Nexus 6P will be eligible to download Google’s latest operating system when it’s going to come out. The reason we are saying this is because Google is actually testing a special Nexus 6P Android 8.0 build right now. Nexus 6P However, the main reason why Android fans are still purchasing Nexus 6P smartphones is because they offer a “pure” Android experience. The smartphone also offers stable performances under any circumstances as a courtesy of its highly powerful Qualcomm octa-core Snapdragon 810 chipset that’s been coupled with an Adreno 430 GPU and 3GB of RAM.

Google has created many smartphones along the years but Nexus 6P is certainly the most successful one of them. The smartphone is being regarded as a consumer favorite and its sales percentages seem to always be growing. The main reason why Nexus 6P is selling so well it’s because Google is directly in charge of it and this means that Nexus 6P owners are going to be among the first ones to receive Google’s latest updates. In fact, Nexus 6P has recently received the latest version of Google’s Nougat operating system. Android 7.1.2 Nougat The Android parent has announced that Android 7.1.2 Nougat is mainly focused on tweaks and enhancements. Even better, alongside all those enhancements Android 7.1.2 Nougat also brings a treat for Nexus 6P owners. The treat we are talking about is fingerprint gestures support and it allows Nexus 6P owners to drag down their notifications panel by simply swiping their finger on the device’s scanner. Fingerprint gestures support might not be an amazing and innovative feature, but it’s nice to have especially since Nexus 6P is quite large in size. How to Download the Update The update is being rolled out OTA (over the air) and it arrives to 10,000 randomly selected Nexus 6P devices each day. Therefore, Android 7.1.2 Nougat should appear in the notifications panel any time now. However, the update can also be manually triggered by accessing the smartphone’s Settings – About Device panel. Enhancements As previously mentioned, Android 7.1.2 Nougat has been packed with tweaks and enhancements. However, many of them are under the hood tweaks that Nexus 6P owners will not even notice that they are there. The most important one of them being the enhancement of Nexus 6P’s Bluetooth network connectivity. Final Words It’s great seeing that Google hasn’t forgotten about its older Nexus brand and that Nexus 6P is still going to receive future updates. In fact, Google is actually working on an Android 8.0 developer preview that’s specifically being developed for Nexus 6P. The only downside is that we can’t know for sure when Google is going to decide to start rolling out Android 8.0.

Even though only three weeks have passed since Android 8.0 developer preview was announced, Huawei has already managed to get its hand on it. Usually, Nexus and Pixel smartphone owners are the only ones that get access to Google’s developer preview ahead of time because both smartphones are directly managed by Google. This time things have taken an unusual turn and Google decided to allow Huawei to start testing out Android 8.0 ahead of schedule. Google Helping out OEMs Google has made it a tradition to always launch its latest operating system updates to the smartphones that it directly manages. This way Google’s products seem more appealing towards customers than they already are. However, this left OEM companies such as Huawei behind in terms of updates and Google had an unfair advantage. Huawei Receives Android 8.0 Ahead of Schedule Considering the fact that Huawei has worked with Google in the past, no one should be surprised by the fact that Google has provided the Chinese tech manufacturer with the source code for Android 8.0 already. Huawei is not wasting any time because it has already been spotted working to update EMUI in order to benefit from all of Android 8.0’s features and tweaks. We should mention that the XDA Senior Member known as “duraaraa” was the first one to discover this. Mate 9 It looks like Mate 9 has been chosen to be the first Huawei smartphone to run on Android 8.0. The new operating system will provide Mate 9 owners with a wide range of features which will make the smartphone’s user experience so much smoother than it already is. However, Android 8.0 is still a developer preview and it still presents a large number of bugs right now. The Senior XDA Member managed to find out that Huawei’s Android 8.0 build includes a new files app and a couple of new developer options. In addition, he also found that the operating system comes in a limited number of language options but this will surely be changed along the way. Interested readers should keep in mind that this is a test build and this means that it won’t arrive to Mate 9 handsets any time soon. Huawei still needs a couple of months before it’s able to start rolling out the public version of it.

With brand safety concerns at the forefront for advertisers, Google and IAS are looking to give advertisers additional visibility into how their ads are appearing on YouTube against a company's brand safety requirements. With this initiative, advertisers will be able to access brand safety reporting metrics, providing additional, independent assurances around where their ads are appearing on YouTube. Given the uniqueness of YouTube's content, and that of the experience it provides to users, IAS and Google will seek to develop a secure and safe solution together that answers the industry's need for transparency. The current IAS solution available to clients is MRC-accredited, and reports on eight separate brand risk categories -- adult content, alcohol content, gambling content, hate speech, illegal downloads, illegal drugs, offensive language, and violence -- to give advertisers a comprehensive understanding of their brand risk. Additional specifications are available to customize risk thresholds, as well as option for geo-compliance, keywords, and blacklists. "Our H2 2016 Media Quality Report show that brand risk continues to be a key area of concern for advertisers, especially as it pertains to politically charged, controversial, or offensive content. Content flagged for hate speech increased by 137% across U.S. display direct and for violence by 27% global video direct from H1 2016 alone," said Scott Knoll, CEO of IAS.

Internet search giant Google is looking to take a swing at India's extremely turbulent FoodTech space and has launched Areo, an app that aggregates food delivery and home services for customers in Bengaluru and Mumbai. Currently, Google has partnered with some of India's leading online restaurants - FreshMenu, Box8 and Fassos to facilitate food ordering on Areo. The service currently lacks any traditional restaurants, but a description of the app says the app will collate restaurants, providers and chefs. Google will even facilitate payments either by credit/debit card, net banking and will also offer customers the option to pay service providers directly in cash. The company hasn't divulged any details of the service just yet, and it isn't clear if it charges a fee for every transaction. While Google has traditionally chosen to partner with service aggregators, acting as a meta aggregator in some sense, with Areo the company seems to be going head to head with services such as Swiggy, FoodPanda and Zomato. While only a few online players are part of the service for now, Google already has a large pool of offline restaurants who list themselves on the platform to be discovered by customers via Maps or its other services. Further, the entry of a large player like Google could upset the balance which has returned to the FoodTech space in India which saw a bloodbath in 2016. Apart from online food ordering, Google is also looking to collate home services such as electricians, plumbers, beauticians on-demand. The company has so far tied up with Urban Clap, one of the leading home service providers in the country today. However, it is highly unlikely that Google will enable delivery services like other players such as Swiggy and FoodPanda. Google has remained mum on the launch of the service in India, suggesting that it's still a pilot the company is running in two of India's most tech savvy cities. As for the foodtech space in the country, high costs of customer acquisition and high customer attrition are among the major issues players have faced, but Google could be at an advantage because of its massive reach and control of the AdWords pipeline to bring in customers. © 2017 Business Standard     Stay Updated with Us Top 10 Stories Last Week Last Month Last Year Mrs. Funnybones makes a case for Google Pixel Advertising Going to market, the Nadia Chauhan way...

In a 15-second television ad, the camera zooms in on a young man wearing the company uniform who says, "OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?" The "OK Google" trigger phrase for Google's artificial intelligence Assistant activated Google Home speakers situated nearby, prompting them to read Wikipedia's description of the Whopper. Burger King apparently intended to prompt the Assistant to deliver the glowing description posted on the page. However, the Internet quickly caught on to the gimmick, and Wikipedia's Whopper page was deluged with newly edited versions, many of them decidedly uncomplimentary. Wikipedia soon blocked the editing functionality. Within three hours or so, Google reportedly issued a server-side update to Google Home to stop it from responding to the ad. The ad would still wake up a Google Home device, which would wait for its query to hit Google's servers, but Home no longer would respond to it. However, Google Home would respond to a real person making the same query. The ad apparently was created by David The Agency. Wikipedia's Whopper Page Gone Wild Someone with the username "Fermachado123" last week changed the Wikipedia entry for the Whopper to list its ingredients, according to reports. The owner of the handle may be Fernando Machado, Burger King's senior vice president for global brand management, although Burger King apparently hasn't confirmed or denied his involvement. "Editing an article on behalf of one's employer or company can create a conflict of interest and violate Wikipedia policies," Wikimedia spokesperson Samantha Lien told the E-Commerce Times. Wikipedia content and entries are determined by a community of volunteer editors. Internet trolls struck minutes after the ad debuted at 12:00 p.m. ET, editing the Wikipedia entry to describe the burger variously as "cancer-causing" or "a chocolate candy", and altering the ingredients list to include such items as "toenail clippings," "medium-sized child," and "rat." Google "could, and likely should, require people to customize the command phrase," suggested Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "The idea that a TV ad could generate a mass purchase should scare them more than it does," he told the E-Commerce Times. Following in Alexa's Footsteps "I'm kind of surprised they used Google Home rather than the far more prevalent Amazon Echo," Enderle said. A 6-year-old Dallas girl earlier this year asked the Amazon Echo Dot, which is powered by Alexa, if it could get her a dollhouse. Alexa was happy to oblige, and the child confirmed the order. She apparently also ordered cookies. A US$160 dollhouse and four pounds of cookies showed up at her home days later. Her mom laughed off the mishap and treated it as a reminder to set up parental controls. However, Jim Patton, a news anchor at San Diego TV station CW6, several days later said, "I love the little girl saying 'Alexa order me a dollhouse,'" during a newscast. His remark reportedly triggered numerous Echo devices in viewers' homes to attempt to order dollhouses. "We need more variance and better vocal security and recognition, particularly when we begin looping in security systems and locks, or they'll unintentionally allow bad folks into our homes," Enderle warned. "That could lead to a massive potential liability exposure for the related products, services, or companies that supply them." Consumers should "be careful what applications they use and what's active when they use them," cautioned Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. Smart Technology Risks Technologies like Google Home and Alexa "have no innate judgment," Jude told the E-Commerce Times. "You shouldn't trust them to use judgment on which commands to respond to or what activities to launch." Google and others will need to focus on the applications behind the voice recognition systems, he suggested. Natural language processing "doesn't imply any real intelligence behind the interface," Jude explained. "As the applications' NLP system front ends become more intelligent, the opportunities for compromise decrease." In the Internet of Things environment, where you can have "an ecosystem or ecosystems of ecosystems interconnected, the attack vector universe is potentially limitless," noted Laura DiDio, research director for IoT at 451 Research. The risks are "everywhere, and what you can do is mitigate risk to an acceptable level," she told the E-Commerce Times -- but that requires vendors to make secure products.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 75 Plus 1 on G+ 144 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares285 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company. I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! Indian Yes we guessed him to be the new man by reading his name, Trevor "Newman" Marcie Mtz Good article...But it's "couldn't care less". chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine CF542 6 months? I replaced my S7E three times in four months for chronic and various problems before giving up and going Pixel blueman24 "Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES." "I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge" "Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months." You brought a $700 S7edge and not a $300 oneplus, so it should not be acceptable for it to become less responsive after 6 months? Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. WARLORD VIII On the up side the Pixel isn't catching on fire 😎 das I thought that was a feature for survivalists. :P Eric Works for me. The most stable software wise of any phone I've ever used. Paid 300 for mine and prefer it over the s7. Curved screens don't like screen protector. Nothing like water resistant on a phone that looks like a cat danced on it. Another huge plus is the lack of carrier spam. I'm not getting all the complaints. Google showed us we'd be getting if we choose to buy it. I for one have no regrets about doing so. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. Kristian Ivanov I'm not going to comment on the actual design, I want to hear thoughts comparing it to the undesputed legend - Nexus 5 (design only) JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. CF542 The only thing that the S7/S8 truly suffer from is having Samsung as a parent. They turned the phone (s) into a piece of bloatware full of crappy software that nobody wants. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Ryan Those are usability preferences. I will agree the settings are a freaking nightmare to find, but I dont go into settings often. Right now, and for over a year now, bluetooth audio has been straight-up broken. They implemented that absoloute volume BS without coding how to handle devices that dont send volume information, breaking it in my car. Then the idiots put developer setting that is to allow you to disable it but they didnt even test it and the user doesnt have permissions to change that setting, so the switch does nothing. That is a BIG bug, and one that Google has refused to address for over a year. Then there is the fact that my phone, and the first Nexus phone I have had to deal with this on, has to be rebooted every few weeks because it slows down horribly. Jack Smith Based on what? Had every iPhone since the 3G and relatively recently added Android as carry both and Android is excellent. So much is written is just simply not true. Suggest actually give recent Android a try and you might be surprised ;). Ryan Ive had android for coming up on 8 years, HTC Hero was the first, then one more HTC before going Nexus. Been on Nexus and still am with my 5x. I know, personally, some of the MAJOR shortcomings of Googles implementation of Android. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. ScratchC The problem with the Internet is how do I know you actually own one? Or are you just a troll. In any case, I unfortunately had to pass on the Pixel my S6 shit the bed and I had just upgraded to the S7. My gf tho.. I somehow convinced her to grab a Pixel on Verizon. She has not had not 1 issue. I'm not saying they don't exist. It's just not as bad as commenters trying to win an argument make it seem. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of the 22 Pixel photos had halos. None of the LG G6 photos had halos. whispy_snippet Wow. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. Vega007 My Pixel is, by far, the best phone I have ever had for battery life. Christopher Bement I'm only going with devices I've actually used, I haven't touched a Pixel personally. All I can say is it's day and night between the N6 and S7 on a given work day where I'm calling, texting and emailing almost constantly. Vega007 That's a good point, it all depends on what phone we have used to compare it to. I have never used a S7 Edge, but I have used a S7. While the battery life was fine, the Pixel does do better for my usage (I'm using the 5" btw). And that's the real key to battery issue is personal use. We all use our devices differently so battery life will always be subjective. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. ScratchC The iPhone has been in trouble for some time. It's why it started playing catch up (Forget current sales up to now. Poll after poll, iPhone users are bored of iPhones) Actually Google's Android is in trouble as well. Samsung is doing their own thing. Google needs to put it's foot down or compete. The Pixel is an attempt to do so. It's not perfect by any means. it's better than nothing and it was a solid first entry. If you simply don't like it.. Buy elsewhere. that's the beauty of Android. I think you guys forget, that out of our fanboy bubble, most people when they think of Android have a distinct definition. I'm talking the average consumer...they think Android = cheap phone from prepaid carrier that's slow, plastic, horrible camera & full of bugs. Or.. Android = Samsung Galaxy. Your average consumer still doesn't know what a Pixel is nvm that they don't even know what a Nexus was. Android phones need to be a premium product to compete. They need to charge the amount of money it takes for proper R&D.. Customer support etc. Google cannot sell at a loss and accomplish this. This very reason is why Samsung holds the Android crown. Regardless of your opinion towards their devices. Remember that Carrier subsidizing is how Galaxy devices sell by the millions. Iphones as well. Google is on the right path. They just need to bring the next Pixel to all carriers. Lindsay Meyer You're right. I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved those iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices), and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick (and their new iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to throw my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability, and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. mrjayviper Fairly new? How long have they been selling Nexus phones and other devices? MJ Let me get this straight... You left a comment without reading the whole discussion? I already very clearly laid out an actual argument but thanks for your input. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. madcanada That's correct, I'm pissed that Pixel gets a better camera software while Nexus is fundamentally the same in the department. I understand your point about camera being a combination of both hardware and software, but unlike, say, Apple, where each iteration is actually better in terms of hardware, and older iPhones still get whatever features they can physically run, Google decided to accentuate the difference by simply denying their last year phone the same updates. Where Apple only denies updates when the old phone can't actually handle them Google is simply abandoning their last year model to justify the price of the Pixel. whispy_snippet Except there's one key difference. Unlike iPhones that release each year, the Nexus 6P is not of the Pixel lineage. The Pixel is the first of its kind. madcanada That makes not a shred of difference in the argument I'm making. I find denying last year phone updates it perfectly capable of running, so you can justify the price of the new phone ethically questionable. I don't care if they rebranded, their decision to not give Nexus the updates it can handle is only guided by the fact that they wanted to charge twice the price for Pixel, and they couldn't have if Nexus got the goodies. whispy_snippet Ethically questionable? No, mate, it's business. Google's ultimate responsibility is maximising profits for shareholders. You're cranky that your 6P can't do what the more expensive a Pixel can do. Now imagine how Pixel owners would feel if they saw cheaper, older phones from the same company doing exactly the same thing as theirs. Again, I sympathise to an extent, but ultimately you get what you pay for. If you want the Pixel experience, buy it. madcanada I'm not cranky because my Nexus 6P can't do things Pixel can, on the contrary, I get full Pixel experience with free unlimited full size photo upload, Pixel launcher, Pixel camera, and day one Google Assistant on Nexus 6P. I'm cranky because I need to go to XDA to get them goodies. I understand it's business, but if you want to sell charge twice for the phone - sell a better phone, give us a better camera, bigger battery life, and don't downgrade our goddamn speakers. whispy_snippet Mate, you're simply not making sense anymore. You're effectively wanting something for nothing. You want Google to give you a Pixel quality camera experience on an older, less expensive phone from an entirely different lineage - for free. You're not entitled to free stuff. I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree. madcanada you can disagree all your want, i outlined my gripe with Google in the first post, then you decided to argue about the camera. New lineage or not, when you market Nexus as the phone that gets all the Google love, and then you just leave users behind right next generation simply to justify the price hike of new Pixel - that's low. Apple's feature fragmentation is driven solely by the hardware - newer phones get new exclusive features because older models can't do the same thing physically. Google is creating artificial fragmentation in order to justify twice the price. That's not the Google I remember and that's not the direction I like. Obviously it's their choice. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? Mix Sounds like you have not done this before because sending your phone to Google first, waiting for them to get it and look it over THEN sending a replacement is, 100%, the bad choice. Having them send you the phone first and put a hold on your creditcard is the better and faster choice! Complaining gets you nothing, USA got free daydream headsets, Canadians got nothing. The phone, after taxes, was $1,320.48 - close enough for me to complain about it at the $1,400 point, lol. John Doe OMG, YOU CAN'T READ? That is what I said Google does but you said you had to wait 7 days for your phone but they send you the phone first then you send yours in so no waiting. Yes I have done this before. With Apple, Google, and other companies...it is standard practice. No, they don't charge you taxes they just put a hold of the price of the phone not your total purchase price. Maybe it is just different in Canada...you should stop buying Google products there *rolls eyes* Lindsay Meyer If your damaged, soon-to-be-returned Pixel phone is broken and unusable, there would indeed be a waiting period to have a working phone in either case, because, being unable to easily switch your device at a physical brick and mortar store, you would be at the mercy of waiting for for Google's mailed replacement to have a working phone again. John Doe Google sens it next day here in the US Mix You straight up told me that I chose the bad option: "Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault." when I did not choose the bad option. If my phone bricked, which it did, and it takes 7 days for Googles phone to get to me I have no phone for 7 days, that is waiting without a phone! I think we are both right, 12 of this and a dozen of that, lol. <3 Stuff in Canada is more expensive and shipping generally sucks. I normally chose 2 day shipping with Amazon and get refunded shipping costs because the shipping companies miss the delivery date constantly. Nexus 4 and 5 have been sweet, my Pixel experience has been garbage. Their customer service has been good though so yay for that. Lindsay Meyer Canadian $ ≠ US $ John Doe Yeah but the phone still does not cost $1,400 in canada so yeah destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less rattyuk This is an American / British thing. I assume your from the U.K. where couldn't care less is the phrase. In the USA it's the opposite. But really this is a tempest in a teapot, the American way of saying... Well you can guess. Two nations separated by the same language. tim242 I am in the US. The phrase is "couldn't care less". Peoppe just say it incorrectly. If you could care less, that means that you have some level of caring. If you could not care less, that means you don't care at all. Oh, and it's "you're from", not "your from". : ) Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I'd far rather spend 5-10 minutes online from home getting my replacement shipped to me for free than having to go into a store, talk to someone who's less knowledgeable about my phone than I am, convince them to get it replaced, and then pay them an additional $35 to have them facilitate my phone then getting shipped to their store where I have to return to pick it up. Sir_Brizz But most people will feel less like that than you when their phone isn't working at all. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If it still takes a week to get the replacement as was my experience, I don't see what difference it makes. Again, only Apple's consistently better in this regard, and irrelevant to those of us who don't want Apple products. Sir_Brizz What? I've used AT&T and T-Mobile to get replacements, I just walk in, hand them my broken phone, they give me a new one, and I'm on my way. Sometimes there is a "deductible" or something but if I need my phone right then, that's better than waiting forever. I agree that Apple is consistently better, but the carriers aren't that bad depending on your situation. I guess that Google is somewhat equally comparable to a carrier store in some fringe situations. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. Marty Lol VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. Aaron Yeah, top notch. Tell that to all those iPhone 6plus users with the death screen disease and Apple does nothing... mrjayviper Out of warranty? I don't think Google supports out of warranty devices to Aaron You missed the point. Point is, Apple produced a product with a design flaw that affected nearly 40% of the users. They went cheap with a connector to the main board. And if that phone fails at month 13 (even though it is a known flaw, in the Auto industry this would have had a government mandated recall), but Apple with it's top notch customer service tells the consumer to pound sand. I worked retail and it was funny that people could be on their 3rd replacement iPhone with same issues (speakers, mics, button, etc) yet they are okay with that shoddy product. One time an Android fails it's "Android phones are cheap junk).". Smh donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. Berni Hargrove Hold on now, Chromebooks are more than good enough if you go price for price on a cheap laptop. There's no way that $200 Windows laptop with 2gigs of ram is performing on the same level as a $200 Chromebook with the same specs. In addition the reason why "Good Enough" applies to this is because the average person wants to pay very little for a computer, but have it be "fast and last a long time" to effectively browse and use Office. Anyone here should know, unless you are getting over on someone, the least you should pay for decent laptop is $500, but the amount of times I've had people in Best Buy whine that that's too expensive for them to just be using Office and small tasks is frequent. Google can make good products that are ready for primetime when they don't have their ass or in the clouds, but sadly as their messaging strategy has showed us, that's increasingly uncommon. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal. Roy https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fef4fa148cb6b5c2f15fcd856ec70e90ed88abb6606e0f6554b4d09654040535.png Max Johnson X-tra Bezel. Eric Marciniak Doesn't help that Best Buy has a giant iPhone 7 ad that literally blocks the pixel display from view right when you walk in haha. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8283702e9d03a34df4cfb2bd525ea593d0304d3937690392b7b3acc57eb7620e.jpg Berni Hargrove Best Buy is terrible with product placement. Shit literally changes every season if not more. Good luck finding anything remotely niche on your own. lol Jon E. Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. Berni Hargrove While I agree with a lot of what you said, some of your logic is flawed. Take america for example. There's over 150 million people here. It would take at least 15 million in sales here alone, just to see 1 in 10 people with it. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers. C Lo Good first article Trevor. Welcome aboard. Suyash Bansal I liked the article. 🙃 Orjuan Google Pixels customer service is great if you ask me. It takes like a week to get a replacement, not a month. Also, comparing it to the One Plus 3T is unfair, you didn't mention the superior processing and graphical power and the fact that it gets updates for the next 5-8 years. It also features Google Assistant, which is a big selling point. Add all those up and pixel is worth the extra 400. Plus, I got a regular pixel, with a two year protection plan, 128 GB, and it's still cheaper than iPhone. Google Pixel is a commercial and consumer success. Do your research before spouting out shit, all you did was look at the obvious facts and ignored the small stuff that counts. "UGHHHHH, it has a better camera and that's it.". RESEARCH YOUR TOPICS, Google Pixel is $400 more than One Plus 3T because it's better! Orjuan Plus, Nexus was barely Google at all, they just supplied the best version of Android while hiring an OEM to make the parts and design, while slapping their logo on it. Nexus was good, but not Google's essence, it was a startup for Pixel, which is 100% Google. AJZ16 couldn't care less* usamaisawake I had an entire column of pixels that were not working properly. Thing is my Pixel arrived in the first shipment and I had to leave the country so I didn't umbox it until 4 weeks later. When I called to let them know, they were curious why I waited so long and I explained I hadn't turned it on till just then. They didn't give me any trouble with it and exchanged it right away. They sent the new phone and then after I received it I shipped the old back to them. Perhaps this was still early in the release of the phone so they felt more obligated to make sure the experience was good. Phil Rowley My pixel bricked. I thought Google's customer service (along with bestbuy even though I paid for their stupid geek squad) were horrible. I hate to say it but Verizon was the most helpful and luckily I pay for their monthly insurance. Colin Richardson I miss the Nexus line.. Thankfully I can still buy some Nexus 5X phones (not refurbished). But that will not last. I have no idea what I will do for a phone after that.. I want a Stock Android phone, not a Stock Android Flagship phone. Max Johnson There are plenty of stock-like flagship and non-flagship Android phones. HTC, Sony, Moto and OnePlus are all stock based at varying prices. If you want direct update from Google and good customer service that's a different story, I think that's the main thing now, to get the same quality of support as Apple on Android. I'm surprised to get frequently updates from Sony with latest monthly security patches on my X Compact. Micah T "couldn't* care less." Think about it.... Tr3ple I bought a Pixel XL for 370 and I threw my Galaxy S7 edge in the drawer LMAO 😂 oh Happy day. Sammy Phillips 370 USD? or 370 Euro? Tr3ple USD, bought it 220 with a broken screen and fixed it for 150. So I spent 370. Sammy Phillips I definitely prefer Android but iMessage is really nice. It's a ubiquitous rich media messaging platform. I wish they'd bring it to Android. Tr3ple Yeah but to sell me the phone so cheap? I guess lol, I'm not complaining mtz Interesting article however, in the same way Microsoft is not really trying to sell the overpriced Surface Studio , Google is not trying to sell Pixels. Why? Simple. Goole has OEM partners that have supported the Android platform by providing the hardware from the beginning. While it one thing for Google to partner with a carrier each year and release a basic Nexus phone its an entirely different thing for them to release top tier Device and undercut thoes partners on price. Tony Bundy Replied via non-existent really blue Pixel. Yes, wasn't easy but here I am. 😀 Pixel.ization.alism Well precisely Google Blue would be #4285F4 not #4485ED if you would ask. Zuxs13 This was a rather poor opinion piece. You make claims like you can't "easily get a replacement pixel" which is completely untrue. The Apple store is hardly the only place that sells phones and offers good customer service. The OP3T might be readily available, but most consumers have no clue what it is or where to even buy one and would rather buy a phone that is sold at their service provider or local best buy and is supported by 24/hr support service. das "Couldn't care less" - if one *could* care less, than it currently cares. Lindsay Meyer I mentioned this in another thread but feel it probably merits its own post here, coming from the perspective of a disenchanted iPhone user who now owns a Pixel (and is still disenchanted). I've been an Apple user for a long time. Loved the iPhones and loyally stuck by them, albeit with a little less enthusiasm every year after iPhone 4s. I was bored, wanting to venture outside the Apple cycle (which is hard to break once you've spent $$$$$ over the years in apps and compatible Apple devices) and bitter that Apple essentially abandons support of their costly older models and all but forces you to continually upgrade. Also, I was tired of clinging to Apple's old identity as a game changer, seeing as their 7 was a nothing but new shade of lipstick, or worse, new packaging on the same lipstick (and their upgraded iOS just made using the hardware on my 6s buggier and more annoying - using the home button w/ fingerprint ID was enough to make me want to hurl my phone at the ground). SO.. Hubby, a long time member of the opposing Android camp, finally talked me into the Pixel, which is what I have now. I gotta say, aside from the gorgeous camera and the option to stick some widgets on my display, it's kind of a let down. The fact that it was the same cost as an iPhone is, honestly, shocking. Many have said before me, and it's true, that Apple doesn't want the risk of unveiling truly new and innovative features. When Jobs left, there was no one crazy enough to continue to push the envelope and risk failure of Apple's #1 moneymaker, so now Apple excels at what Android (or at least my Pixel) does not - fluid, exceptionally clear and reliable usability and an unfailingly friendly UI, omnipresent support and a $#¡+ ton of amazing, well-supported apps. Other phones, incl my Pixel, will have more innovative features, but Apple with come right behind it and perfect those features. That's what they do now. Still glad I didn't get the iPhone 7; Apple didn't deserve my business, but Pixel has been a disappointment to me thus far. For the price, I'd prefer my husband's Nexus 6. I think he'd prefer his old HTC if it had front-facing speakers lol. I just don't feel there's a lot of good options out there right now that justify the cost. I have given serious thought to trying to find a replacement comparable to the old Sanyo 6100 (yes, that one) and then throwing an iPad or a tablet in my purse. Maybe even that old B&O phone would be fun. I'm just tired of my need for a smartphone to be continually exploited by these inferior products; half the time they break right after the warranty expires, and like an endentured servant, I'm forced into the process all over again. Also, the fact that this Pixel wants to track everything I do scares the bejeezus out of me. I'm sure Apple has done the same thing more covertly for years, but seeing everything I say, type, search, view, read.. not to mention every place I eat at, travel to or shop.. neatly organized into a little packaged profile makes me feel like a product more than ever. Eliminating Google's permissions to track this info also eliminates much of the Pixel's functionality as a smart phone with fluid communication between apps. I should have probably mentioned this first because I absolutely hate that aspect of it. Renee Looker I don't know about anyone else's opinion on the Pixel phone but I have the Pixel XL Blue and have had it since release. I've not had any issues with my phone, absolutely love it. Really quite eager to see what Google will be releasing next, the rumors are on the rise on what's up next. Nicholas Conrad Great article! techieland You and we are the customers when it come to the Pixel and Pixel Xl. And even the late and great Nexus products to some extent. Personally I think the Pixel phones were a fail, Google should have stuck to making reference level phones to ensure the manufacturers understand what the minimum an Android phone is supposed to be like. Samsung and OnePlus obviously gets it but it seems LG, HTC, & Motorola, are struggling despite all 3 being manufacturers of Nexus/AOSP devices. sgtguthrie *couldn't care less Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 7 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 22 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] LG's weird new Tone Studio headphones are already on sale for $200 at various retailers ($30 off) 2017/04/13 3:19am PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] A Normal Lost Phone is down from $2.99 to $0.20 worldwide 2017/04/13 2:53am PDTApr 13, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Check out these cheap and temporarily free apps, games, and icon packs from the last few days 2017/04/12 10:16am PDTApr 12, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Google app v7.0 beta includes new Assistant Notification settings, plans redesign of Assistant Services directory, and hints at new device called "Bisto" [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/13 4:29am PDTApr 13, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 123 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares209 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Toggle Google Assistant Notifications 1.2 Prevent icons from being added with new app installs 1.3 Bug fix: No more crashing from swiping away cards 2 Teardown 2.1 Services are going to be easier to manage 2.2 code 2.3 A new device type called "Bisto" 2.4 code 2.5 code 3 Download The Google app went through a major version bump to 7.0 and began rolling out to the beta channel a couple of days ago. A bit of digging around turned up a few new settings, but nothing that explains why the version number went up on this release. Along with the new features, a teardown also raises some light on a few things we can look forward to in the future, including some vital improvements for Services accessed through Google Assistant and what may be a new type of device. If you're not part of the beta channel, you can grab the latest version of the Google app – now with fewer crashes – from APK Mirror. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Toggle Notifications for Google Assistant Toggle Auto-add app icons for new installs (Android O) Bug fix: No more crashing on card dismissals Toggle Google Assistant Notifications Google is working hard to make Assistant more useful and appealing to users, and that often means it will have to behave a little differently from one user to the next. Not only that, but it probably has to behave a little differently from one device to another, especially when they come in different form factors. The latest Google app update brings a little more configurability with a new setting for Assistant that allows users to toggle notifications on or off for their phones and Google Home devices. Here's the description: Receive notifications like weather updates on this device. Even if notifications are off, you'll still hear alarms and important updates. By default, the setting will be enabled on phones and disabled on Google Home. If you would like to change the setting, just go into the Google app Settings screen and then tap into the Assistant settings. You can switch between the Phone settings and Google Home with the dropdown at the top of the page, and then switch between Home units with another selector further down the page. Notifications toggles for Google Home (left) and phones (right) It's safe to assume that this refers to those low-priority items that silently slip into the notification list with current weather conditions, due dates for bills, and occasionally some important local news. At least that's how they usually present themselves on a phone. Google Home might be a different story, and that might make this a little more interesting. So far, Assistant on Google Home has only been known to become active when an alarm goes off or somebody interacts with it directly through voice commands or casting. The rest of the time, it stays quiet. Enabling this setting would seem to suggest that it could now (or soon) wake up from time to time to let you know it started raining outside or that the mayor of a nearby town was arrested for some pretty nasty things. (True story.) I've had the setting enabled for several hours on my Google Home, but there haven't been any notifications read aloud to me yet. I don't know if there just haven't been any events or if this isn't really supposed to be doing anything (yet). Prevent icons from being added with new app installs A couple of weeks ago, a teardown turned up a new setting destined for Google's launcher. Its purpose was to simply turn off the behavior that created icons on the home screen for freshly installed apps. That toggle is now live in the v7.0 update, but with a weird catch: It only works on Android O, or API 26, to be specific. Only users running a developer preview will be able to see the toggle for now. Readers of the teardown rightly brought up the point that the Play Store offers a similar setting. However, that toggle only applies to apps installed through the Play Store, not to those from other sources like the Amazon Appstore. Perhaps this is related to–or inspired by–the change in the way unfamiliar app installers are handled in Android O. Bug fix: No more crashing from swiping away cards If you installed v7.0.4 of the Google app and ventured into your Now stream, there's a pretty good chance you also tried to swipe away a card and witnessed the scene above. Yes, there was a bug in that release and it had the undesirable effect of crashing the home screen. Version 7.0.6, which is linked below, fixes the issue. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Services are going to be easier to manage After Google opened the gates for developers to build services for Assistant, there was a predictable flood of submissions attempting to get the attention of users. We're now staring at an unwieldy, disorganized list that's pretty hard to keep up to date with. Naturally, Google is moving to solve this by adding a few tools to make all of these services a little easier to sift through and use. First, services (referred to as "agents" by Google's developers) will be sorted into categories so you won't have to stumble through a list containing everything from food delivery services to games. <string name="agent_directory_category">Category</string> <string name="agent_directory_category_list_header">Categories</string> If you're still having trouble finding the service you want, you'll also be able to ask Assistant to help out. <string name="agent_directory_ask_prompt">Ask your Assistant</string> Once you're using a service and find that it's really good (or bad), you'll be able to give your feelings about it with a rating, feedback, or even report it if something is really not right about it. Ratings will obviously also be reflected in the directory of services so everybody will be able to ignore the ones that didn't live up to other peoples' standards. code <string name="agent_directory_rate_service_prompt">Rating</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_subtitle">Rate your experience with %1$s on Google Assistant</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_title_after_rating">Your rating</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_title_before_rating">Rate %1$s</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_five_stars_button">Five stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_four_stars_button">Four stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_three_stars_button">Three stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_two_stars_button">Two stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_one_star_button">One star</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_agent_avg_rating">%1$s star rating</string> <string name="agent_directory_agent_rating_menu_delete">Delete</string> <string name="agent_directory_agent_rating_menu_edit">Edit</string> <plurals name="agent_directory_a11y_user_rating"> <item quantity="other">Your rating %d stars.</item> <item quantity="one">Your rating %d star.</item> </plurals> <string name="agent_feedback_from_header_text">From</string> <string name="agent_directory_feedback_send">Send</string> <string name="agent_directory_report">Report service</string> <string name="agent_directory_report_agent_text"><u>Report service</u></string> Once you've chosen a few services that you like, you'll be able to add them to a personalized list. The term 'shortcut' is also used a few times and might be a way for users to attach their own custom names to services, and maybe even fill in some of the information for regular requests. <string name="agent_directory_my_services_header">My Services</string> <string name="agent_directory_shortcuts_title">Your %1$s shortcuts</string> <string name="agent_directory_shortcuts_subtitle">Customize your shortcuts for %1$s</string> <string name="agent_directory_shortcuts_create">CREATE</string> Most of this is pretty predictable stuff and was bound to happen eventually, and perhaps it should have been done a bit earlier. Nevertheless, as the infrastructure improves, so does the ecosystem. A new device type called "Bisto" Every once in a while, something really unusual comes up in a teardown... This is one of those times. There's a new device type listed among the strings in this update, and they refer to something known internally as "Bisto." This obviously has nothing to do with the British brand of foods, but instead refers to a device that is somehow distinct from other current products. code <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_android_tv">Android TV</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_bisto">Bisto</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_google_home">Google Home</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_nexus">Pixel</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_phone">Phone</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_wear">Android Wear</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_android_tv_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdAndroidTvCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_bisto_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdBistoCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_google_home_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdGoogleHomeCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_nexus_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdNexusCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_wear_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdWearCategory</string> The list of device types above shows that Bisto is going to be treated differently from Android TV, Google Home, Android Wear, a Google Pixel, and the general category of "phone." Of course, since this list already makes a distinction between the Pixel and a regular phone, we can't eliminate the possibility Bisto is another phone or a special release matching one of the other products. code <string name="bisto_device_notifications_pref_title">Spoken notifications</string> <string name="bisto_device_notifications_pref_summary">Notifications will be read aloud inside your headphones</string> from /res/xml/assistant_device_id_bisto_settings.xml <PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.PreferenceHolder android:key="@string/assistant_device_id_group_holder"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.MainScreenPreferenceCategory android:title="@string/assistant_settings_device_id_category" android:key="@string/assistant_device_id_bisto_preference_category"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.MainScreenDropDownPreference android:persistent="false" android:key="bistoDeviceId" /> <SwitchPreferenceCompat android:persistent="false" android:title="@string/bisto_device_notifications_pref_title" android:key="bistoNotifications" android:summary="@string/bisto_device_notifications_pref_summary" /> </com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.MainScreenPreferenceCategory> </com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.PreferenceHolder> </PreferenceScreen> The current manifestation involving Bisto is a single toggle that offers to read notifications aloud to the user through headphones. This means the product can at least support headphones, which only really eliminates Android Auto and other in-car products – many states and countries don't allow drivers to wear headphones. We can also surmise that Bisto includes a screen since this setting gives the option to read notifications through headphones, but likely shows them in some other way if the setting is disabled. In other words, it's probably not an audio-only device like Google Home. Since these are settings for Assistant, the final assertion we can make is that the device will obviously include Google Assistant. From that, we can also assume it will have a microphone and probably a speaker. Okay, those aren't strictly sure things, but the odds are in our favor. Unfortunately, that's about as far as the clues take us. It probably has more in common with a phone than it does with Google Home, and it's not going to be exclusive to a car... Bisto might be an entirely new category of hardware, a specially branded device from an existing category, or even just the name used internally for Android One devices with Google Assistant. It's too early to speculate much beyond that, but we'll definitely be on the lookout for more hints.

Cody Toombs It's certainly possible. There are a few variants of Glass roaming around, including a couple of models that are only available to partners and supposedly one that has no screen and operates a lot like Google Home. That last one can probably be ruled out because it lacks a screen, but I could see how some of the partners might want Google Assistant on their Glass units. I hope this isn't the case since it means we probably wouldn't get to confirm it for a long time. On the other hand, it's always possible (but unlikely, I think) that Google is thinking about taking another run at launching Glass. marcusmarcus2 Maybe it is for "Android Things" Isaac Fischer Guesses for Bisto: a Glass redux or a wall panel / standalone home control device. whispy_snippet Bisto = Bison? Guest You can change the notification setting for Google Home through the Google app the same way you can for the phone. When I go to settings through the Google app there's a toggle to select either my Pixel XL Assistant settings or Google Home Assistant https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cdb9430794930787147ba2eb5fe2032e0a4528b2dc567b1c549a034f441c1ef1.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9cec9c79b31aca40a0b7f0025450a895c74544e859fb60bae9c7d280e6ff1cce.png settings Cody Toombs Ahh, you're right. I don't know why I keep forgetting that, I even explained the layout in a teardown many months ago. Every time I see the dropdown indicator, I think it's used for collapsing the section below it, which makes no sense. DJ SPY We've been able to turn off and on the thing about a new app icon being added to the home screen, directly from the play store for ever. What's the point of that option being in the Google app now? F4LL0U7 Second paragraph of that section: "Readers of the teardown rightly brought up the point that the Play Store offers a similar setting. However, that toggle only applies to apps installed through the Play Store, not to those from other sources like the Amazon Appstore." mike shwilly How about song recognition? Or it will be classic Google waiting a whole year to present this "feature" with a new OS? Josh Flowers Seriously! I heard a song yesterday, pulled out the phone, "ok google -- what's this song?" --"I'm sorry, I can't do that yet." Instant thought: I've replaced a superior product with an inferior product. F4LL0U7 Why not just use the widget icon that you can add to your home screen? That still works. Josh Flowers Don't have a widget. I think I deleted 'Sound Search' when I had Google Now. Just re-installed, thanks...but bummed I have to do so. F4LL0U7 It's not the standalone Sound Search app that hasn't been updated in years. It's a widget that's part of the Google app itself. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b12d0cd106c2504e21827d19c9164f96401e390950988d2fa533f424eb61fa80.png Andrew Robotham No black status icons?

I mean, it makes some sense, but who said that? Callum Saunders I'm thinking that bisto is this reiteration of google glass that is audio only. I'd say maybe a take on apple's airpods but that include google assistant? This would tie into the partnership with sony to bring the high quality bluetooth audio to Android O. I imagine these will be bundled with the pixels to compensate for removing the headphone jack and this would be a way for them to market it as BETTER than the headphone jack.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 April 2017 by Military News A Leading Printing Services Sydney Company Says Print Advertising Is Still An Essential Marketing Tool Absolute Colour Printing in Sydney explains why print advertising is still the most important form of marketing for a business in Australia A leading printing services Sydney company has today launched a campaign to help small business owners understand why printed media is still a vital way to gain customers and increase revenue. Absolute Colour Printing Services, who has become one of the most recommended printing suppliers in Australia provides all types of services including printed media for Trade Shows. With the explosion of the Internet, many small businesses have made the mistake of ignoring how powerful printed media really is, a mistake that has not been made by major companies such as Woolworths Limited and even Google. With people becoming fed up with Google AdWords which has forced Google to make major changes to the way it displays these adverts, and email marketing campaigns going straight into the junk folder, printed media once again comes out on top for powerful results. A spokesman for Absolute Colour Printing Services said: “Printed media marketing is helping small businesses gain the exposure they need, reaching direct to their target audience, locally and nationally.” There are many reasons according to Absolute Colour Printing and marketing experts why printed media is still the most powerful way to gain a potential customers attention. High-quality printing allows a business to create a lasting impact and unlike online marketing, printed media can be passed on to a friend or workmate who may be interested in the service or product that is being advertised. Printed media also allows a business to decide which area in their local or national location they want to target. That can include having leaflets or other marketing material delivered direct to a home or placed in a location where people will see it, providing a real maximum impact. Printed media also provides flexibility. Printed media such as printed flyers, leaflets, posters, and brochures can work well as a stand-alone campaign or work jointly with an online campaign or radio and TV advertising. “Printed media provides credibility. Anyone can put a website online, but by having printed media and a physical address, it provides a customer with the confidence that the printed media is promoting a credible business, ensuring a high response rate”, explained a spokesman from Absolute Colour Printing Services The printing services Sydney company explains there are many other reasons why printed media stands out and why more small businesses should use it as part of their campaign. They include branding, target marketing, and engagement. Absolute Colour Printing in Sydney provides a whole range of professional services, which include Business cards, booklets & brochures, point of sale, posters, and many more professional and affordable services. To see all the services available, and to learn why the Sydney printing company has become one of the most recommended and most affordable in Australia, please visit http://www.absolutecolour.com.au About Absolute Colour Printing Absolute Colour Printing is a well-known and reputable Sydney printing services company that believe that a company’s printed collateral proves their positioning and positioning makes them a leader in their marketplace.

"I'm not on the inside of their business. I don't know what all their concerns are as far as their overall program for rolling it out, so yeah that was a concern." Now months later, she sees the Haskin Park hut removal and replacement with a smaller infrastructure hub as a positive, because Google Fiber has told her they are going to continue in San Antonio with a smaller tech footprint. "They continue to look at how they can best roll out the system. It looks like it will be less huts in general, smaller scale huts and shallow trenching techniques," says Taylor.  Google has yet to release a public redesign for their work, but TPR has learned that they also may include wireless technologies to extend the network quicker. Google purchased wireless internet provider WebPass last year.   When Google--with the city's blessing--built one of their network huts in the small Haskin Park on the city's northeast side, it became a flash point for a neighborhood that had seen several water pipe breaks and other property damage as a result of Google laying the fiber optic cable for the high-speed service. Complaints started coming in to the council district and to the mayors office, and the city paused construction. Taylor says she felt it was the right move, "Because I wanted to ensure that to the largest extent possible San Antonians would continue to welcome the company.  TPR: "And you saw that going the other direction? Taylor: " Yes." District 10 councilman Mike Gallagher says the removal is a win-win. "Because we've been able to preserve having Google Fiber in the neighborhood, but at the same time we've reduced the impact on Haskin Park," says Gallagher. It's unclear how the delay will affect the timeline for Google Fiber's completion. Google Fiber hasn't commented on the future hut sizes or their network redesign, but in a statement said: “We’ve heard from the community, loud and clear, that they want Google Fiber - but they also want it deployed with a minimum of disruption to San Antonio’s neighborhoods and citizens."

But after completing just two - and receiving neighborhood opposition to their placement - the locations of the remaining 15 are under review and all hut construction has halted. © 2017 Texas Public Radio About TPR Support TPR Financial Reports Public Events Calendar Employment/EEO Community Advisory Board Nominations Privacy Policy Contact TPR

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Bing Image caption Only white babies appear in a search for "babies" on Microsoft search engine Bing... There is growing concern that many of the algorithms that make decisions about our lives - from what we see on the internet to how likely we are to become victims or instigators of crime - are trained on data sets that do not include a diverse range of people. The result can be that the decision-making becomes inherently biased, albeit accidentally. Try searching online for an image of "hands" or "babies" using any of the big search engines and you are likely to find largely white results. In 2015, graphic designer Johanna Burai created the World White Web project after searching for an image of human hands and finding exclusively white hands in the top image results on Google. Her website offers "alternative" hand pictures that can be used by content creators online to redress the balance and thus be picked up by the search engine. Google says its image search results are "a reflection of content from across the web, including the frequency with which types of images appear and the way they're described online" and are not connected to its "values". Ms Burai, who no longer maintains her website, believes things have improved. "I think it's getting better... people see the problem," she said. "When I started the project people were shocked. Now there's much more awareness." Image copyright Google Image caption ...and white hands appear if you type "hands" into Google. The Algorithmic Justice League (AJL) was launched by Joy Buolamwini, a postgraduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in November 2016. She was trying to use facial recognition software for a project but it could not process her face - Ms Buolamwini has dark skin. "I found that wearing a white mask, because I have very dark skin, made it easier for the system to work," she says. "It was the reduction of a face to a model that a computer could more easily read." It was not the first time she had encountered the problem. Five years earlier, she had had to ask a lighter-skinned room-mate to help her. "I had mixed feelings. I was frustrated because this was a problem I'd seen five years earlier was still persisting," she said. "And I was amused that the white mask worked so well." Image copyright Joy Buolamwini Image caption Joy Buolamwini found her computer system recognised the white mask, but not her face. Ms Buolamwini describes the reaction to the AJL as "immense and intense". This ranges from teachers wanting to show her work to their students, and researchers wanting her to check their own algorithms for signs of bias, to people reporting their own experiences. And there seem to be quite a few. One researcher wanted to check that an algorithm being built to identify skin melanomas (skin cancer) would work on dark skin. "I'm now starting to think, are we testing to make sure these systems work on older people who aren't as well represented in the tech space?" Ms Buolamwini says. "Are we also looking to make sure these systems work on people who might be overweight, because of some of the people who have reported it? It is definitely hitting a chord." Diverse data Ms Buolamwini thinks the situation has arisen partly because of the well-documented lack of diversity within the tech industry itself. Every year the tech giants release diversity reports and they make for grim reading. Google's latest figures (January 2016) state that 19% of its tech staff are women and just 1% are black. At Microsoft in September 2016 17.5% of the tech workforce were women and 2.7% black or African American. At Facebook in June 2016 its US tech staff were 17% women and 1% black. You get the picture. But what has that got to do with algorithms? "If you test your system on people who look like you and it works fine then you're never going to know that there's a problem," Joy Buolamwini argues. Biased beauty Of the 44 winners of a beauty contest last year judged by algorithms, and based on some 6,000 uploaded selfies from 100 different countries, only one was non-white and a handful were Asian. Alex Zhavoronkov, Beauty.AI's chief science officer, told the Guardian the result was flawed because the data set used to train the AI (artifical intelligence) had not been diverse enough. "If you have not that many people of colour within the data set, then you might actually have biased results," he said at the time. On a more serious note, AI software used in the US to predict which convicted criminals might reoffend, was found to be more likely to incorrectly identify black offenders as high risk and white offenders as low risk, according to a study by the website Propublica (the software firm disputed these findings). Suresh Venkatasubramanian, an associate professor at the University of Utah school of computing, says creators of AI need to act now while the problem is still visible. "The worst that can happen is that things will change and we won't realise it," he told the BBC. "In other words the concern has been that the bias, or skew, in decision-making will shift from things we recognise as human prejudice to things we no longer recognise and therefore cannot detect - because we will take the decision-making for granted." Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Are we accidentally programming prejudiced robots? He is however optimistic about tech's progress. "To say all algorithms have racist manifestations doesn't make sense to me," he says. "Not because it's impossible but because that's not how it's actually working. "In the last three to four years what's picked up is the discussion around the problems and possible solutions," he adds. He offers a number of these: creating better and more diverse data sets with which to train the algorithms (they learn by processing thousands of, for example, images) sharing best practice among software vendors, and building algorithms which explain their decision making so that any bias can be understood. Ms Buolamwini says she is hopeful that the situation will improve if people are more aware of the potential problems. "Any technology that we create is going to reflect both our aspirations and our limitations," she says. "If we are limited when it comes to being inclusive that's going to be reflected in the robots we develop or the tech that's incorporated within the robots."

Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Apr 13, 2017 at 5:35PM It's a battle of the FANG stocks. Digital video veteran Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) takes on online search and advertising giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), best know for its Google-branded operations. If you could only buy one of these today, which one's the better choice? Let's find out. Image source: Google. The case for Google Alphabet is a deceptively simple business these days. The Google segment stands for a staggering 99% of the umbrella company's total sales, and all of its profits. More than all, actually -- the "other bets" division is still stuck with negative operating profits. If you understand internet-based search and advertising, you understand the current iteration of Alphabet. In that space, Google holds unequaled market share and industry clout. Revenues are soaring, free cash flow growth has accelerated in recent quarters, and share prices more than doubled over the last three years. GOOGL data by YCharts. Business is good, but Alphabet will not fit that mold forever. Search ads brought the company this far, building a massive revenue base from which it can launch many new operations. Some will fail and fade; others are sure to catch on and start producing serious bottom-line profits. The best bets on the table so far include the Waymo self-driving car platform, the Calico medical research company, and an Internet of Things strategy built around the Nest line of smart home products. Alphabet is getting ready to go offline, becoming a conglomerate of wildly different operations in the process. That's how you build a business for the very, very long haul. Buy Alphabet if you don't want to worry about the "sell" button for several decades. Image source: Netflix. The case for Netflix Unlike Alphabet, Netflix can't boast solid bottom-line results quite yet. Earnings are barely positive, cash flows are diving deep into red ink, and the stock is incredibly overvalued by nearly every traditional metric. Yet, I heartily recommend investors take a closer look at Netflix. All is not as it seems. The company announced and then executed a global rollout, installing streaming video services in nearly every nation on Earth. China remains a difficult nut to crack, and American businesses simply can't work in embargoed territories like North Korea and Syria, so it's not quite 100% coverage. Still, that ambitious, market-growing project is essentially complete. Without the budget pressures of a worldwide service installation to worry about, Netflix's management has promised to increase its bottom-line earnings in 2017 and beyond. Granted, cash flows will stay negative for a few more years. That's a side effect of the company's massive content production plans. The company has financed its production budget via new debt in recent years, and it will probably hit the debt market again in 2017 and 2018. But look at what Netflix will have built, just a couple of years down the road. A global content distribution network will be married to a first-class entertainment studio, creating a two-pronged video entertainment attack like nothing we've seen before. Meanwhile, the portion of humanity that has access to Netflix-grade network connections is growing explosively. Netflix hopes to establish itself as the player to beat in an expanding market, kind of like the Google we knew 15 years ago. The cash investments Netflix is making now are building an impressive content portfolio for the long run, which will continue to bring in and hold onto paying customers for years to come. This is the stock to pick if you're looking for exciting growth in the next 5 to 10 years. Beyond that, I have no idea where Netflix will go. Image source: Getty Images. Two winners Let me be clear: There are no bad choices, here. It's the ultimate cop-out, but I'll stand by it. Alphabet and Netflix are two fine long-term investments, but also dramatically different ones. I own both and plan to hold them for many more years. Netflix may need some attention in, say, 2025, as the mature company enters a new era. I could probably leave Alphabet leave alone until my kids graduate from elementary school, grow up, and retire. So, I understand that your mileage might vary, and Netflix certainly offers the bumpier ride. But you probably want to have a bit of both in your portfolio.

Instead, it ended up with a Whopper of a problem By Hayley Tsukayama 8:30 AM Friday Apr 14, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Food & Beverage Industry Food & Drink Mobile Business United States A Burger King sign in Illinois, US. Photo / Washington Post Burger King successfully ran an alternate version of its advertisement designed to trigger Google Home devices late Wednesday, the company said in an emailed statement Thursday. "Last night, Burger King launched very similar commercials that 100 per cent triggered the smart speaker technology. The commercials aired during Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon," said spokeswoman Dara Schopp. The company altered the ad's audio in such a way that it was able to get around whatever block the Google Home had against the original commercial. Schopp also said that Burger King saw a 300 per cent increase in "social conversation" on Twitter as compared to the day before - indicating that, good or bad, the commercial got people talking about the company. Earlier, it was reported a Burger King ad designed to trigger Google's voice-activated Home smart speaker and have the device advertise the Whopper no longer works. The ad, released Wednesday, features an actor dressed as a Burger King employee, who says, "Okay, Google: What is the Whopper burger?" The line is meant to trigger the device to reel off the definition of a Whopper using the first line of the burger's Wikipedia page. (Yes, the Whopper has its own Wikipedia page.) Roughly three hours after the ad launched, the ad stopped working. Google's Home would only light up in response to the commercial's prompt and stay mum (although it will give you the first line of the Wikipedia article if you explicitly request the definition of a "Whopper burger"). Continued below. Related Content Wording of workplace stress advice concerning says union rep John Drinnan: When does plain talk become hate speech? Steve Braunias: Secret diary of Nicky Hager and Jon Stephenson The fast-food company confirmed that the ad no longer triggered the speaker, but it said it would still air the ad - and indicated that the ad may start working again. "You'll have to tune in tonight to see if the commercial triggers the Whopper sandwich definition response," said Burger King spokesman Brooke Scher Mogan. Mogan said Burger King saw the ad as an opportunity to "do something exciting with the emerging technology of intelligent personal assistant devices." Google did not respond to requests for comment. A person familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak on the record said the fast-food chain did not consult Google before making the commercial. When you take over someones phone or tablet and have it do your own remote commands intentionally, you are HACKING. While commercials - often those about home hubs - have accidentally triggered voice assistants in people's homes before, this seems to be the first time an ad has tried to do it intentionally. Based on comments on the ad's YouTube page, many consumers did not appreciate having their devices hijacked. "When you take over someones phone or tablet and have it do your own remote commands intentionally, you are HACKING," read one comment. Once the ad started gaining attention, Wikipedia users began altering the first line of the article about Burger King's Whopper. These edits included references to the burger as "cancer-causing" and stating that its ingredients include "cyanide." It appears that Burger King itself tried to fix the Wikipedia problem. The first sentence changed to a suspiciously glowing description of the Whopper, authored by user "Fermachado123" - a name that sounds similar to Fernando Machado, Burger King's senior vice president for global brand management. We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case. Google spokesperson Burger King did not confirm or deny that Machado edited the article. Privacy concerns about voice-activated speakers and the connected home have been on the rise as more companies have introduced these products, putting pressure on the makers of voice-operated security systems and door locks to ensure that their devices can't be triggered by unauthorised voices. The place of advertising on the Google Home and similar products has been thoroughly debated by users as they have become more commonplace. Many users don't want to be spammed with ads delivered by what they consider personal assistants. Google subjected itself to criticism after Home users heard what appeared to be an unprompted plug for Disney's "Beauty and Beast" when the film opened last month. Google said at the time that mentioning the film wasn't meant to be an ad but simply a notice to users about what was timely that day, according to a statement provided to CNET. "We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case," a Google spokesman said. - Washington Post By Hayley Tsukayama Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

In the first version of the 15-second ad, which ran Wednesday on TV and is on YouTube, a man dressed as a Burger King worker asks the camera, "OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?" That question triggered Google Home speakers to read the introduction to Wikipedia's page devoted to the Whopper. The ploy worked fine for Burger King until Wikipedia users began editing the Whopper Wikipedia page to include phrases such as: "The ‘Whopper’ is the worst hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King,” and that ingredients included "rat and toenail clippings" and a "medium-sized child." Wikipedia subsequently locked the Whopper page from new edits. And by Wednesday afternoon, Google had deactivated the ad's ability to trigger Home devices. But Burger King launched two slightly tweaked versions of the ad late night Wednesday on episodes of NBC's The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel Live on ABC in New York, Miami and Los Angeles. By substituting the voice saying the command with a woman's voice or a different male voice from the man seen in the ad, the new spots again activated Google Home devices. When USA TODAY tried the ads Thursday morning, Home once again started listing Whopper ingredients, courtesy of Wikipedia.  For Burger King, the ad served as a way to tap into the growing ownership of home speakers with AI-enhanced digital assistants such Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri — and of course, to generate some buzz. The company on Wednesday saw three times the activity on Twitter as it did the previous day, it said in a statement to USA TODAY.  Not all of that activity was positive, however, with one software developer noting sarcastically that the practice "definitely can't go wrong or be used in any way." The chain, which is owned by Ontario, Canada-based Restaurant Brands International, has long been known for its wacky ad campaigns. These have included the mask-wearing — and, by some, considered creepy — king character and the costumed Subservient Chicken, who  responded to Web commands such as "dance" or "do jumping jacks" in its 2004 debut and returned in 2014 to promote the Chicken Big King sandwich.  © Provided by USA Today Burger King's TV spot helped generate word of mouth, which likely translates into more visitors at its restaurants, said marketing professor Jonah Berger of the University of Pennsylvania's The Wharton School, and author of Contagious: Why Things Catch On.  "This is particularly valuable to Burger King rather than, say McDonald's, or someone else, because Burger King wants to be known as an edgy restaurant or establishment that does interesting, creative and different sorts of things. It’s part of their brand equity," he said.  Google may not be officially on board — the company declined comment and nixed the initial ad's effect on Home devices. But it can still win from Burger King's move because "a whole bunch of people who didn't know what Google Home was or hadn't heard of it may (now) go out and buy one," Berger said. Google may have inadvertently set the stage for advertisers to play with Google Home with its own advertisements. During the Super Bowl, the "OK, Google" in a Google advertisement set off Google Home devices in owners' homes, to their surprise and annoyance. But copy-cat advertisers should beware. "Just like any other marketing campaign, the first time someone tries something, it's creative, innovative and everyone says it's great," Berger said. "But two weeks from now, if every brand is doing this with every ad, people are going to start getting pretty annoyed." The big tech companies — Google, Amazon, Apple — competing to dominate consumers' time and activity with the most perceptive artificial intelligence in their phones and homes are also toeing a fine line. These AI-powered devices seek to anticipate users' needs, plumbing owner's schedules, tastes, locations and shopping habits to do so. Any breach of that privacy risks backlash.  In fact, Google itself got some Home customers riled up last month when the news that Disney's Beauty and the Beast film had arrived in theaters was among the device's regular daily news and weather updates. "This wasn't intended to be an ad," Google said in a statement to USA TODAY at the time. "We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case." Contributing: Jessica Guynn in San Francisco.

But that might be a problem of the past thanks to Google’s new AutoDraw tool, which turns your ugly doodles into clean graphics. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE     It’s incredibly simple to use, and a whole lot of fun. Start drawing, and Google starts guessing what you’re trying to draw with a banner running atop the page. Basically, imagine a robot trying to play pictionary. Click on one of the suggestions, and the app will replace your sketch with a nice clean bit of artwork. It will then suggest some other artwork that might more closely approximate what you were looking for. The results are impressive. Google was able to tell that when I drew this: I was aiming for something like this: Or that when I sketched this little monstrosity: I wish it had come out like this: You can color in the graphics and apped other shapes and objects as well if you’d like, before exporting the file as a PNG Keep in mind it’s not really prettifying your sketches – it’s simply identifying what your trying to draw and then picking an image from a pool of clip art. Still, it’s a pretty awesome proof-of-concept, and with the included rudimentary editing techniques to color in and modify the graphics, it might just be useful too. on AutoDraw Read next: NYU student goes undercover at Chinese iPhone factory AppsGoogle Share on Facebook (1100) Share on Twitter (318) Napier Lopez is a reporter from New York City, US.

Image Credit: Screenshot Google has finally begun to provide hints about the app that’s been under development by Bebop, the startup created by VMware cofounder Diane Greene that Google acquired in 2015. The Bebop website advertises job openings at the URL hire.withgoogle.com, which brings you to a splash page for an announced service called Google Hire. The service is already working; Warner Bros. subsidiary DramaFever and the startups Medisas and Poynt are among the organizations already using it as a hub for job openings. Axios reported on Google Hire earlier today. The arrival of Google Hire comes a few months after Google announced the alpha launch of a Cloud Jobs application programming interface (API) that companies can use to add job searching to their own websites. Google Hire could represent competition for companies like Greenhouse, Indeed, Jobvite, LinkedIn, and Oracle’s Taleo. Back in 2015 Google chief executive Sundar Pichai provided a high-level description of Bebop. “Bebop is a new development platform that makes it easy to build and maintain enterprise applications. We think this will help many more businesses find great applications, and reap the benefits of cloud computing,” Pichai wrote in the blog post announcing the Bebop acquisition. It’s not clear how much the product has changed since Pichai wrote those words. Google declined to comment. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

This time around, the AI movement seems to have a tailwind in the form of critical enabling and supporting factors By Terence Davis, VP and Chief Architect, Incedo (Network World) 14 April, 2017 06:47 - - - - print email Comments  Over the last several decades, the evolution of artificial intelligence has followed an uncertain path – reaching incredible highs and new levels of innovation, often followed by years of stagnation and disillusionment as the technology fails to deliver on its promises. Today we are once again experiencing growing interest in the future possibilities for AI. From voice powered personal assistants like Google Home and Alexa, to Netflix’s predictive recommendations, Nest learning thermostats and chatbots used by banks and retailers, there are countless examples of AI seeping into everyday life and the potential of future applications seem limitless . . . again. Despite the mounting interest and the proliferation of new technologies, is this current wave that much different than what we have seen in the past? Do the techniques of the modern AI movement – machine learning, data mining, deep learning, natural language processing and neural nets – deserve to be captured under the AI moniker, or is it just more of the same? In the earlier peaks of interest, the broad set of activities that were typically bunched together under the term ‘AI’ were reserved for the labs and, if they ever saw the light of day, they were severely constrained by what the technology of the day could deliver and were limited by cost constraints.  Many of the algorithms and structures central to AI have been known for some time; rather, previous surges of AI had unrealistic expectations of immediate consumer applications that could never be accomplished given limitations of the data and techniques available at the time. Within the last five years however, the combination of enormous amounts of data and improvements to database technology to effectively utilize it, along with increases in computer horsepower to process it, have enabled AI to move from mainly scientific and academic usage to enterprise software usage, becoming viable as a mainstream business solution. This time around, the AI movement seems to have tailwinds in the form of a few critical enabling and supporting factors: Technology and computing horsepower driving AI capability at the right (aka low) price point The availability of platforms from major players in the field like Google, Microsoft, Elon Musks’ OpenAI, Amazon, etc. Mainstreaming of practice – slowly building critical mass of practitioners who leverage these platforms Mainstream customer interest and demand reflected in real world ‘everyday’ use cases – data security, computer assisted diagnosis in healthcare, fraud detection, purchase prediction, smart home devices and more Increasing mass of data that is waiting to be exploited, which cannot be done solely by human means Changed customer expectations from what is doable using technology, which is further driving innovation in a secular manner (e.g., Alexa) As the tide is turning for AI, innovation- and technology-driven corporations and their leaders – think IBM, Yahoo, Salesforce, Uber and Apple – have become believers in the power of AI and are willing to commit long term funds to this pursuit. The desire to inject new technology into their operations to drive corporate efficiency or improve workflows (both customer and back-office) has convinced many large corporations that this new iteration of AI is worth investigating and worth investment through acquisitions and investments in startups that innovate independently.  In addition, tech heavyweights Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft recently joined forces to create a new AI partnership dedicated to advancing public understanding of the sector, as well as coming up with standards for future researchers to abide by. With so much support from these titans of industry, it’s no wonder that the latest burst of AI interest seems to be gaining momentum rather than losing it. But are the techniques used today truly what is meant by AI? As is typically the case in questions of technology and business, the answer is yes and no. Just like there are varying levels of complexity in other areas of technology (consider the range of databases from simple to complex; from SQL to NoSQL; or the range of programming languages LOGO, BASIC, C, Perl, Swift, R) there are many technologies and techniques that naturally fall under the moniker ‘AI’. AI as a technology is nebulous. Would machine learning be possible without access to large amounts of data from a traditional SQL or a cutting-edge NoSQL environment? Could an AI package be effectively used without modern concepts of APIs and REST services? In my opinion, all of the tools commonly covered and discussed today are a part of the larger AI family of technologies that are going to drive the next generation of consumer, corporate and government solutions. On the other hand, you have to remember that true “artificial intelligence” won’t happen anytime soon – at least no examples that can act independently of human intervention. A true AI system has the ability to learn on its own, making connections and improving on past scenarios without relying on programmed algorithms to improve capabilities.  This is thankfully, still the realm of Science Fiction. What is called AI even today is in fact, the leveraging of machines with minimal – though not zero – human intelligence to solve specific, narrow problems. Humans still have the upper hand as machines cannot think on their own and rely on human intervention (through code) and past data to be able to work. They can be better at finding patterns that humans can miss and find similarities between objects, but this is possible only through sheer horsepower.  With today’s state-of-the-art they will never be able to invent something totally new or independently address a problem that they have never come across before. Most of what passes for AI today is the sophisticated application of statistical techniques to data invented in the past four-to-five decades, not ‘real’ intelligence. Please note however, that this designation does not detract from the immense capabilities afforded by the newfound resurgence of AI.  It may not be fundamentally “intelligent” but is no less useful and impressive. While the core technologies of AI are similar to those of prior years and the term AI has become somewhat of a catchall for a variety of different techniques, the biggest difference – and perhaps what will spur future cycles of interest – is the thirst for and commitment to more from both corporations and consumers.  With continued funding, research and interest in AI and with advances in the tools and techniques needs to capitalize on them, perhaps one day we will finally witness the emergence of true, independent AI.

Google is bringing styling ideas to Image Search. Been eyeing a cute blush pink purse from Zara, but have no clue what you'd actually wear it with? You could always consult Pinterest for styling ideas, but now there's another option: Google. The Web giant on Thursday introduced a new feature called "style ideas" that aims to deliver sartorial inspiration inside Image Search. The feature is available in the Google app for Android and on the mobile web. Now, as you're browsing fashion product images, Image Search will "surface a grid of inspirational lifestyle images and outfits that showcase how the product can be worn in real life," Google Associate Product Manager Julia Enthoven wrote in a blog post. With this new feature, "you can see real-life options of what bag and jeans look stellar with those red high heels you've been eyeing," Enthoven wrote. "Or if running gear is more your speed, no sweat—workout ensemble ideas are just a tap away." Related Google Image Search Tips for Advanced Graphic Ninjas Google Image Search Tips for Advanced Graphic Ninjas Google will also now display an expanded carousel of "similar items" when you're searching for specific apparel products. This way, you can find something that looks like the budget-busting Kate Spade bag you've been drooling over, but with a more affordable price tag. "Whether you're researching shorts and sneakers or checking out sunglasses and handbags, you'll be able to find product offerings that may suit your tastes," Enthoven wrote. "Uncovering a bargain option without sacrificing style is now accessible right from Image Search." The new feature comes after Google last year brought shopping ads to Image Search.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News RemoveSlander.com Release 3 Steps To Protect Your Privacy From Trump Bill S.J.Res. 34 RemoveSlander.com release 3 way to protect your online privacy from internet search providers. Online PR News – 13-April-2017 – New York, New York – The CEO of RemoveSlander.com says the Trump Administration has just made it a lot easier for annoying mugshot websites to gain access to booking photos, and arrests information. CEO Tyronne Jacques said over the past 36 months his firm started to see a decline in the number of third party mugshot websites, however in recent weeks since President Trump signed S.J.Res.34, there has been a spike in the number of new sites appearing in Google, sites with no removal option. How S.J.Res. 34 Leaves You Exposed? On March 28, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law S.J.Res. 34, which nullifies the Federal Communications Commission’s final rule titled Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunication Services. Previously under the Obama Administration, several protections were put in place to limit internet service providers like Google, Facebook, and Yahoo from selling information like browser history, and search results but the Trump Administration has just removed all of those protections with one swoop of his presidential pen. In a recent interview with the CEO of RemoveSlander.com, he says all of the progress that was achieved in the banishing of 3rd party websites that monetize public records have been tossed out of the window, leaving arrested individuals exposed with zero right to privacy. Arrest information has just doubled in value for data mining servicing seeking to sell public records to lead generating services similar to those patronized by Attorneys. “The signing of S.J.Res.34 symbolizes the return of the Wild Wild West in terms of Internet Privacy, and the right to be forgotten. President Trump has just legalized the Big Brother scenario thus empowering service providers to profit from everything published about you online, including your mugshot photo.” “Always keep in mind that your name is your brand, and just like large corporations protect their brand with PR Firms, you too have that same right to hire an Internet Publicist like RemoveSlander.com.” Tyronne Jacques went on to say that there is no such thing anymore as privacy especially when it comes to public records, therefore if you have concerns about photos and links appearing online, then the time is now to delete as much of your search history as possible. “My firm was the first to offer search history removal long before the emergence of mugshot websites, as a matter of fact in 2010 there was only one site in Florida that published booking photos. Fast forward to 2017; there are now dozens of websites profiting from the republishing of public records. This new bill signed into law has just rendered all State Legislation attempting to reform the abuse of Transparency Laws irrelevant.” The CEO of RemoveSlander.com suggested three steps you can take today that would help in guarding your sensitive information against Internet service providers. 1. Create profiles with pseudonyms to protect your birth name from information contained in your search history. This new bill gives internet service providers the right to sell the content in your emails without your permission, therefore creating a pseudonym will add the first layer of privacy. 2. Be mindful not to visit sites that could eventually prove embarrassing if there is ever a hack, like the one witnessed at Yahoo in 2016, and Dolly Madison in 2015. The internet has changed which means that your search behavior also has to change if you’re logged into Google or Yahoo using your birth name. 3. Finally, attack humiliating links on the first page of your Google search results with a relentless vengeance. Many people have the misconception that negative items will naturally expire or fade away over time, this is far from reality. The truth about malicious websites like Whopostedbail.org and Florida.Arrests.org is those links will remain at the top of your search results until steps are taken to have them deleted. CEO Tyronne Jacques went on to say that your arrest information is very valuable to companies who profit off ad revenue. With the passage of S.J.Res.34 there is now zero incentive for mugshot websites to remove content published about your arrests because, that booking information could prove more valuable to a DUI Attorney in need of leads. A fourth and final tip the CEO of RemoveSlander.com shared with us is you have the right to protect yourself from the internet. That right includes hiring a firm like RemoveSlander.com to target and remove any link that is a violation of your privacy. The CEO of RemoveSlander.com suggest that a great starting point to gather as much information about published mugshots is to search Google and add the word ‘Mugshot’ to the end of your name. In doing so, he says that Google or Yahoo will return results that best match – and give you the opportunity to target for removal all of the mugshot links at once. About Internet Publicist RemoveSlander.com Founded in 2009 as a Cyber Bully protection firm, RemoveSlander.com has assisted thousands of clients in protecting their search history from Internet Service Providers and Third Party Data Mining Websites. In 2012 RemoveSlander.com provided expert analysts for ABC World News in their coverage of the Rising Mugshot Industry. Based out of New Orleans Louisiana and still privately own, RemoveSlander.com has perfected the art of removing embarrassing links and photos from the internet as well as the promotion of positive publicity for their clients. “Always keep in mind that your name is your brand, and just like large corporations protect their brand with PR Firms, you too have that same right to hire an Internet Publicist like RemoveSlander.com.” He concluded.

Adding new features like saving videos to view offline, background playback and more. We get a lot of questions about YouTube content, but this is the biggest one. Here we’ll explain how to save or download YouTube videos and music to an Android device. To be clear, Google doesn’t approve of users downloading videos or music from YouTube to their Android devices, as that is technically piracy. However, they do allow certain videos to be temporarily saved on a device for offline playback. It’s limited to a short amount of time though. Not permanent. Read: How to Listen to YouTube Videos on iPhone Without Video The offline playback feature is one users asked about for a while, and arrived in late 2014. Many have enjoyed it for some time, but in 2016 it was pushed to a paid version of YouTube. It’s called YouTube Red, and for a small fee you can get this feature. Or, just follow our instructions below. There are plenty of apps available like YouTube Ripper that will pull content to download and save. As we said moments ago, this is illegal and Google or Apple quickly remove these types of apps from the store. Many mentioned in our comment section are no longer available either. We’ll say this one more time. Using some of the apps or services below are illegal. Google doesn’t allow users to steal content from YouTube. Whether that be video or audio. It’s against the rules to copy it to your device. That said, it is still very easy to do. Users can save entire videos to their device, or even pull music right from a video. Then download the MP3 file to an Android smartphone or tablet. Instructions First off we’ll explain the legal and Google-allowed system, which is saving videos for later playback. Certain videos that support this feature will have a download arrow just below the video on Android devices. Sadly this feature is now limited to YouTube Red subscribers. Tap the arrow and select a resolution or quality you’d like to save, and that’s it. Now just go into the menu bar on the left and select “Watch later” to find the list of saved videos to enjoy. These can be played without an internet connection. However, if you want to download a video or song permanently, that is an option as well. There are plenty of apps available to rip content from YouTube directly to your Android device. Rather than link to apps that aren’t available from the Google Play Store, or from shady sources, we’ve gathered a few simple websites that will do this for you. All users need is the URL from YouTube and a few clicks will download the song or video. While viewing a YouTube video just tap the 3-dotted “Share” button and on the popup that appears select “Copy URL”. Some versions it’s an arrow that stands for share. This is what you need, then navigate to websites like YouTubeMP3.to or clipconverter.cc and paste in that link. Usually within seconds they’ll convert the video, and deliver a MP3 of the music. Including a full video clip for the user to download and save to their Android smartphone or tablet. The first one has a slew of output options too. Copy and paste the URL into a site like YouTubeMP3 and simply hit convert, then download. From here you’re all done and the song has been saved to your smartphone or tablet. Other Details This same process is very easy to do from a PC or laptop, but just as easy on Android smartphones and tablets. Clipconverter even lets you select the conversion format to suite any occasion or need. Read: How to Create Custom Ringtones for Android Searching for “video downloader” or “Youtube Downloader” on the Google Play Store may find some results. Most have been removed as of early 2017. Instead use what’s mentioned above rather than apps. Don’t download any application for Android that claims to do this if it isn’t on the Google Play Store. Third party sources aren’t typically safe. Give it a try today and download some music or videos. Now users can enjoy any video, or the latest music to create your own custom ringtones with our how to above. Again, proceed at your own risk and enjoy. 38 Responses 09/16/2015 Orenko Reply Much easier with: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chaweng.tubedownloader 06/02/2016 David Reply Watching youtube offline on mobile is really nice to kill boring time.

Long ago I was a man of SmugMug, and then Flickr, and then at some point spent days and days copying years of images to iCloud Photo Library before eventually disregarding that and switching to Google. What can I say? I’m a simple person who can be easily delighted and swayed by automatic GIF creation and reliable backups. And Google Photos keeps getting better. Here’s the latest example: now the mobile app can automatically stabilize videos in your camera roll with a tap. A lot of flagship smartphones offer optical image stabilization when shooting video, a hardware feature that helps keep footage smooth. Others, like Google’s Pixel, use software to try and stabilize jerky movements. Putting stabilization inside the Google Photos app could enhance results further if you’re already working with hardware OIS, or improve recordings significantly if your phone lacks any means of steadying things out of the box. The stabilized video is cropped in a bit, as you might expect, and the original clip remains in your Photos library; there’s no overwriting. Here’s a side-by-side demo someone else made of the app’s latest trick. That said, it’s not going to produce miracles. Don’t expect a video that was particularly rough from the start to suddenly look like it was filmed with a Steadicam. I shot a terribly rocky video of my walk to get lunch (sorry, I don’t know how to ski) using my Pixel XL with stabilization disabled, and the Photos-stabilized version was indeed smooth — but with a fair amount of warping and other weird visual distortions to show for it. Your browser does not support HTML5 video. But if you just want to smoothen the pans of some vacation video you took with your phone for Facebook or Instagram, I’d imagine this should work pretty well. It’s at least something for Android users who never got Instagram’s Hyperlapse. I’ve asked Google for some nerdy specifics behind how Photos performs its stabilization but haven’t yet heard back.

A touch of a finger unlocks the phone - no password required. With services like Apple Pay or Android Pay, a fingerprint can buy a bag of groceries, a new laptop or even a million-dollar vintage Aston Martin. And pressing a finger inside a banking app allows the user to pay bills or transfer thousands of dollars. While such wizardry is convenient, it has also left a gaping security hole. New findings by researchers at New York University (NYU) and Michigan State University suggest that smartphones can easily be fooled by fake fingerprints, digitally composed of many common features found in human prints. In computer simulations, the researchers were able to develop a set of artificial "MasterPrints" that could match real prints similar to those used on phones as much as 65 per cent of the time. The researchers did not test their approach with real phones, and other security experts said the match rate would be significantly lower in real-life conditions. Still, the findings raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of fingerprint security on smartphones. "It's almost certainly not as worrisome as presented, but it's almost certainly pretty darn bad," said Professor Andy Adler, a professor of systems and computer engineering at Carleton University in Canada, who studies biometric security systems. "If all I want to do is take your phone and use your Apple Pay to buy stuff, if I can get into one in 10 phones, that's not bad odds." Full human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but the finger scanners on phones are so small that they read only partial fingerprints. When a user sets up fingerprint security on an Apple iPhone or a phone that runs Google's Android software, the phone typically takes eight to 10 images of a finger to make it easier to make a match. And many users record more than one finger - say, the thumb and forefinger of each hand. As a finger swipe has to match only one stored image to unlock the phone, the system is vulnerable to false matches. "It's as if you have 30 passwords and the attacker only has to match one," said Professor Nasir Memon, a professor of computer science and engineering at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering, who is one of three authors of the study, published in IEEE Transactions On Information Forensics And Security. The other authors are Dr Aditi Roy, a postdoctoral fellow at Tandon School, and Professor Arun Ross, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State. Prof Memon said their findings indicated that if you could somehow create a magic glove with a MasterPrint on each finger, you could get into 40 per cent to 50 per cent of iPhones within the five tries allowed before the phone demands the numeric password. Apple said the chance of a false match in the iPhone's fingerprint system was one in 50,000, with one fingerprint enrolled. Apple spokesman Ryan James said the firm had tested various attacks when developing its Touch ID system. Google declined to comment. The actual risk is difficult to quantify. Apple and Google keep many details of their fingerprint technology secret and the dozens of companies that make Android phones can adapt Google's standard design in ways that reduce the level of security. Professor Stephanie Schuckers of Clarkson University, who is director of the Centre for Identification Technology Research, was cautious about the implications of the MasterPrints findings. She said the researchers used a commercially available software program that was designed to match full fingerprints, limiting the broader applicability of their findings. She noted that mobile-phone makers are studying anti-spoofing techniques to detect the presence of a real finger, such as looking for perspiration or examining patterns in deeper layers of skin. A new fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm, for example, uses ultrasound. Still, the team's fundamental finding that partial fingerprints are vulnerable to spoofing is significant, said Mr Chris Boehnen, the manager of the United States federal government's Odin programme, which studies how to defeat biometric security attacks as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. "What's of concern here is that you could find a random phone, and your barrier to attack is pretty low," he said. Phone makers could easily increase security by making it harder to match the partial fingerprint, he said, "but the average phone company is more worried about you being annoyed that you have to put your finger against the phone two or three times than they are with someone breaking into it". Adding a larger fingerprint sensor would also decrease the risk, Mr Boehnen said. And some newer biometric security options, such as the iris scanner in Samsung's new Galaxy S8, are harder to fool. Prof Memon said that, despite his research, he was still using fingerprint security on his iPhone. "I'm not worried," he said. "I think it's still a very convenient way of unlocking a phone. But I'd rather see Apple make me enter the PIN if it's idle for one hour."

Your Kids’ School-Owned Devices Are Spying On Them, Report Finds Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Your Kids’ School-Owned Devices Are Spying On Them, Report Finds Image courtesy of Jason Cook April 13, 2017 3:43 pm EDT By Kate Cox@kcoxdc research privacy eff education coppa what privacy ferpa data privacy ed tech As adults, we all kind of have at least a vague peripheral sense that the devices and software we use are probably up to some kind of shenanigans with our personal data. Kids, however, are probably not thinking as closely about what they tell the devices they use, and what data those devices then share — especially if they’re school-owned tools. And yet, a new report finds, some of the learning technology schoolchildren are required to use every day are some of the worst when it comes to explaining and protecting users’ privacy. The EFF’s new “Spying on Students” report [PDF] pulls together two years’ worth of research and data trying to find out whether educational technology (ed tech) companies are protecting students’ privacy. The answer is, unfortunately, largely not. One third of all K-12 students are using school-issued ed tech devices, the EFF finds. About half are Chromebooks, and more than 30 million total students, teachers, and administrators are using Google’s education suite of software. And parents are being largely left in the dark. The EFF surveyed parents to see if software was transparent about how it handled student privacy — and, in fact, if schools were being transparent with how they used software. In both cases, the answer was no. “We were given no information about our first-grader receiving a tablet this year,” one parent responded. “And when we ask questions, there is little information given at every level.” Teachers and students reported the same kind of, “surprise, you’re using this now” approach to technology in the classroom. 57% of parents the EFF surveyed said they were sure they had not received written disclosure of schools’ practices and policies about tech, and another 23% of parents said they didn’t know if they had or not. Together, that’s 80% of parents who have basically no idea what their children’s’ schools are doing with regard to technology. Lack of awareness, however, is not to be conflated with lack of interest. Parents who answered the survey expressed concerns about what data was being collected on their kids and where it was going, but were unable to get answers. One told the EFF, “They are collecting and storing data to be used against my child in the future, creating a profile before he can intellectually understand the consequences of his searches and digital behavior.” Another echoed the sentiment, adding, “The school system does not even acknowledge that our child’s data is being collected and possibly sold.” In total, survey respondents generated a list of 152 distinct programs and platforms being used for school. Of those: 118, or 77%, had a privacy policy posted online at all 78, or 51%, included a stated policy on data retention 46, or about 30%, said the vendor used encryption 51, again about a third, mentioned de-identification or aggregation of user data Nor could parents easily opt out, either in theory or in practice. The legal situation around students’ data is complicated, the EFF then explains. It’s basically a nexus where two other laws meet: FERPA, the Family Educational Rights And Privacy Act, and COPPA, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. FERPA forbids schools from sharing student information without parental consent, the EFF notes, but it has weaknesses. For one thing, it only applies to districts and schools that receive federal funding — so it would apply to kids in public school, but not most private schools. For another: It only applies to certain types of data. That includes “education records” and personally identifiable information about a student. Usage history is also covered, unless the identifying information is stripped. Here’s the challenge, though: While the law requires written parental consent to share students’ data with third parties, it has a big loophole for “third parties.” If any ed tech company is qualified as a “school official,” it can access your kid’s data. That has included Google and other companies that sell educational technology. COPPA likewise requires parental consent from a company before it collects or shares data from children under 13. That right there rules out protections for your junior high and high school set, who are ages 14 and up. However, for kids who are covered, the FTC is fairly clear on schools’ obligations, the EFF reports. The FTC’s guidelines are that if a service is going to use or disclose children’s personal information “for its own commercial purposes in addition to the provision of services to the school, it will need to obtain consent.” The school district cannot consent on behalf of a parent if advertising or user profiles are going to be involved. But if parents aren’t even getting told what platforms and devices their kids are using, odds aren’t high that schools are providing them with proper opt-out opportunities, either. Nor is industry self-regulation sufficient, the report adds. Many entities have signed the voluntary Student Privacy Pledge since 2014, but it has loopholes one could basically drive a school bus through. It doesn’t define terms like like “personally identifiable information” or “school service provider,” leaving gaping holes where a school could violate students’ privacy and yet still claim to comply. “Our report shows that the surveillance culture begins in grade school, which threatens to normalize the next generation to a digital world in which users hand over data without question in return for free services—a world that is less private not just by default, but by design,” report co-author and EFF Researcher Gennie Gebhart said. Gebhart added, “The data we collected on the experiences, perceptions, and concerns of stakeholders across the country sends a loud and clear message to ed tech companies and lawmakers: families are concerned about student privacy and want an end to spying on students.” Was this helpful?

Health IT Google, virtual reality, AI and healthcare: A perfect equation By Erin Dietsche Post a comment / Apr 13, 2017 at 5:08 PM Shares7 “I’m personally excited about healthcare because I’m obsessed with trying to do something for the greater good in this world, and it starts with the human species.” With these words, Olivier Rabenschlag, head of creative at Google, discussed why healthcare is different from the other industries he’s worked in throughout his career. Although he’s spent time in the world of advertising, he explained why he’s more passionate about healthcare. “[Healthcare] is more challenging. It is also more rewarding if you end up coming up with a solution,” he said during a HITLAB live streamed discussion at Columbia University Medical Center on April 13. Advertisement In his time at Google, Rabenschlag has already started to see some of these solutions happen. For example, Google Cardboard — a virtual reality headset that costs about $15 — made headlines last year when it saved a baby’s life in Florida, according to CNN. As Rabenschlag pointed out, the child was born without a lung and with a piece of her heart missing. Though the surgeons at Nicklaus Children’s Hospital wanted to view the baby’s heart and lungs in three dimensions, their 3-D printer was broken. Instead, they resorted to Google Cardboard. “Through an existing app they found, they managed to convert all those images into VR-compatible imagery that allowed the team of surgeons to look at the child’s heart through Google Carboard,” Rabenschlag said. The surgeons then performed a successful surgery and the baby survived. And Google isn’t only making its mark in the virtual reality space. Rabenschlag also touched on how the tech giant is placing a bet on “machine learning and AI, making things a lot smarter and seamless and moving more into predictive models than reactive models.” These technologies, combined with what Verily is doing, could have the potential to impact health around the globe, Rabenschlag said. Verily, which Rabenschlag described as the “healthcare specialist for the whole Alphabet organization,” is working on a project called Debug. Via Debug, researchers are finding ways to rear and release sterile mosquitoes in an effort to reduce virus-spreading mosquitoes and eradicate diseases. “Verily is all about trying to move from reactive healthcare to proactive healthcare,” Rabenschlag said. On a larger scale, Rabenschlag is hopeful about what the future of voice technology holds. “Voice technology represents a two-way conversation, and I think a two-way conversation is vital for consultations or discussions around healthcare,” he said. “It’s all about being able to facilitate a dialogue.” But Google is taking the voice technology concept one step further with Google Expeditions, through which people can use Google Cardboard to have a 360-degree view of a space or location. “When you think about what that would mean for a patient to be able to talk to a doctor almost seemingly live is groundbreaking,” Rabenschlag said. “I think voice, but also sight, sound and motion together through VR is pretty fundamental if we can crack it.” Photo: ANDRZEJ WOJCICKI, Getty Images Shares7 Topics AI, artificial intelligence, Google, health IT, healthcare, verily, virtual reality 4 ways Trump administration’s stabilization rule could change individual health insurance market 4 key compliance issues for medical device companies Hear the latest industry news first.

The 15-second ad starts with a Burger King employee holding up the sandwich saying, “You’re watching a 15-second Burger King ad, which is unfortunately not enough time to explain all the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich. But I’ve got an idea. OK, Google, what is the Whopper burger?” If a viewer has the Google Home assistant or an Android phone with voice search enabled within listening range of the TV, that last phrase - “Hello Google, what is the Whopper burger?” - is intended to trigger the device to search for Whopper on Google and read out the finding from Wikipedia. “Burger King saw an opportunity to do something exciting with the emerging technology of intelligent personal assistant devices,” said a Burger King representative. It said the ad is not in collaboration with Google.

Roston - Apr 13, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google Assistant is now able to help manage your vacations via a couple new abilities, including finding fun things to do in whatever location you’re at (or heading to) and managing your existing flights. Don’t have a flight yet? Google Assistant is also now able to find flight prices on your behalf and to keep track of their prices, alerting you whenever something changes. 4 things to know before you buy Google Home Google announced the new features yesterday, revealing that Google Assistant and thusly Google Home are now able to find and manage your flights, though the latter feature depends on whether you’re using a Gmail account. Assuming you are, Google Assistant will pull information on your existing flights from your inbox, but only if you turn on Personal Results. Not sure how to do that? Google has all the details here. Someone’s wedding became your mini vacay. You say the place, we’ll track the price. #GoogleAssistant #GoogleHome https://t.co/f1ZGW4MI6j pic.twitter.com/MuoUBDK8kD — Made by Google (@madebygoogle) April 12, 2017 If you haven’t purchased a plane ticket yet or you need a new one, you can also ask Google to find flights for you. This option can be refined in various ways, with Google Assistant supporting a myriad of voice commands. For example, users can search for a flight by a particular airline, such as, ‘Find me flights with Southwest.’ As well, flights can be searched based on date, stops, final destination, schedules, regions, and prices (of which ‘cheap’ is an option). Google says that once a user starts tracking a flight, new notifications about it will be delivered via both Google Now cards (assuming you use them) and through your email account. To request information on the flight once you purchase it, users can say things like, ‘Is my flight on time?’ or ‘What times are my flights?’ This information can be requested based on the airline the flight is through, the month of the trip, or the flight’s destination. Finally, once the user gets to their final destination, Google Assistant (via your phone in this case, presumably) will find things to do via this command: ‘Things to do in …city,’ replacing city with the actual name of the destination, of course.

Earlier this year Google confirmed an Android 7.1.2 Nougat update with a beta. The beta release let Nexus and Pixel users test the software and its changes well ahead of its official release date. In early April, Google pulled the Android 7.1.2 Nougat from beta and released it for devices like the Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P, and Nexus 5X. The update’s been out for several days but the Android 7.1.2 Nougat OTA is starting to pickup some serious steam for Google’s stable of devices. Android 7.1.2 Nougat is a maintenance update but it’s a big maintenance update. To give you an idea, it’s several hundred megabytes for the Nexus 5X. A while it’s aimed at solving lingering Android Nougat problems, you’ll want to be extremely careful with Android 7.1.2. It could cause problems for you and your device. Some of you will probably be fine installing the Android 7.1.2 Nougat update the second it arrives Over-the-Air. Some of you might want to take a rain check for a few hours or a few days. If you’re feeling leery or if you simply want some more information before making your move, take a look at our list of reasons to, and not to, install Android 7.1.2 Nougat on your Nexus or Pixel today. Install Android 7.1.2 Nougat If You Value Security   1 / 7 If you're concerned about the security of your Nexus or Pixel device, you'll probably want to install the Android 7.1.2 update in the near future.  Every month, Google rolls out security updates to its Pixel and Nexus-branded devices and this month is no different. Google's Android 7.1.2 Nougat updates are rolling out with its latest security patch on board. The April security update comes a huge list of patches for potential exploits, you can read about them all over on the company's Android Security Bulletin.  If you failed to download or receive an older security update (March, February, etc) you will be forced to install them before you can download the Android 7.1.2.  If you want to better protect your phone and the information stored on it (banking information, various logins, things of that nature), you probably want to install Android 7.1.2 Nougat and any security updates you might've missed.    1 / 7 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

The e-retailer is offering its seven-microphone array and voice processing tech to hardware makers who want to include voice activation in their products, but don't want to spend the enormous time and money required to make their own systems work. The Alexa Voice Service (AVS) basically adds the Echo/Alexa technology into other people's products, giving it access to Amazon's music, weather, general knowledge, and timer core product as well as the ability to add in third-party "skills" that work with the system and, presumably, the manufacturer's own default settings. The Echo/Alexa has been an unexpected success for the company, thanks in large part to its accuracy at picking up what people say and responding intelligently. It has led to a rush by other tech companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple, to incorporate their versions into other products. Only Google has so far copied Amazon's standalone Echo speakers with its Google Home product, but others are attempting to add their voice recognition and analysis technology (Cortana for Microsoft, Siri for Apple and now Bixby for Samsung) to as much hardware as possible. Where Amazon continues to stand out in the market, however, is its ability to hear commands and questions from a distance using its far-field 360-degree mic array and voice processing technology. Even Google's Home is inferior in picking up what people say. Not so fast Of course this being Amazon, the company intends to keep a pretty firm leash on any companies that decide they want to add Alexa tech to their product. First Amazon has to accept you: you "request an invite" from Amazon for access and have to tell it who you are, what your product plans are, and what chipset and programming languages you will use. Then you have to sign up to Amazon's terms and conditions, follow its integration guidelines and then get sign-off from Amazon for any and all marketing materials. From its "guidelines": All marketing materials – which include press releases, packaging, retail fixtures, websites, crowdfunding sites, Amazon product detail page content, and videos that reference Amazon Alexa – must be sent to avs-marketing-review@Amazon.com for approval before use. Marketing approvals may take up to 10 business days. And then there are the kids. Amazon is very sensitive about its Alexa devices being used by children, mostly because the idea of children being able to access information or order things just by talking out loud is enough to ban them from any family home. As such, Amazon bans any connection between third parties using Alexa tech and children. "Do not," it commands, "show children under the age of 13 or who appear to be under the age of 13 using Alexa in any marketing materials." It goes on: "Children should never be shown interacting with Alexa, and Alexa services should never be portrayed as being directed to or intended for children." And just to make things real clear: "Do not make any marketing of your device overtly attractive to children (eg, the marketing should not encourage children to ask their parents to purchase your device)." All that said, it's a smart move on Amazon's part. If it can get third parties to create new devices with its tech hardwired in, it only builds up an ecosystem that strengthens the entire Alexa network – and it does so with other companies' marketing and development dollars. Amazon is looking for a permanent foothold in what is a blossoming market, and so long as it can rein in its control-freak tendencies, this program might just achieve it.

Recently Android 7.1.2 Nougat was released as a beta, and is now available for Nexus and Pixel owners across the globe as of April 3rd. Here’s what owners need to know about the Android 7.1.2 Nougat update for Pixel and Nexus devices. Following a few quick maintenance and security updates, Google’s now ready to improve the core of Android Nougat. Now that most new devices have received updates to Android 7.0 Nougat, like the Galaxy S7 or LG G5, Google’s moving on to Android 7.1.2 as we speak. Read: Google Pixel Review: A New Generation of Android Overall It looks to improve on the stability of the original release, fix some bugs, and add a few new features to the Pixel. Additionally, Google is delivering some popular features for Nexus 5X and 6P owners. Here’s all the details for those getting the Android 7.1.2 Nougat update this week. Back on January 30th Google released Android 7.1.2 Nougat as a limited beta for select devices. For two months users have been testing it, and now we’re ready for more improvements. The second developer preview was released on March 20th, and now the official release is here. Which Devices Can Get Android 7.1.2 Nougat Of course all Android smartphones and tablets should eventually get the latest version of Android. Well, most recent devices at least. For now though, this is limited to Nexus and Pixel users, as it’s still in beta form. The Android 7.1.2 Nougat release is available for the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, and Pixel C. All devices should see updates starting April 3rd and beyond. Older devices like the Nexus 5 or Nexus 6 are not included. Android 7.1.1 may be the end of the line for those. Although they will still get security patches each month. Most are still happy to just have Nougat, but Nexus and Pixel devices always get the latest release first. With Android O betas rolling out and more details coming at Google I/O, this is the latest software available for the near future. What’s New in Android 7.1.2 Nougat We knew Google had a few bugs that need to be fixed, and that’s exactly what you can expect once Android 7.1.2 hits your device. The latest April security patches are included as well. The official blog states it’s an “incremental maintenance release focused on refinements, so it includes a number of bug-fixes and optimizations, along with a small number of enhancements for carriers and users.” This basically means that nothing major will be included, aside from a few small tweaks. So far we’re seeing some fingerprint scanner gestures for the Nexus 5X and 6P, like swipe for notifications, and other things. Not to mention lots of bug fixes for the Pixel and Pixel XL. Here’s one changelog we found for the Pixel XL Android 7.1.2 update. Improved fingerprint swipe performance Additional improvements/fixes for audio popping issue some users were experiencing while playing audio at high volume Bluetooth connectivity improvements Fix to the early shutdown battery level issue Battery usage alerts Fix to the pink banding issue a small number of users were experiencing on the camera Other than those, the Pixel C has the new Pixel Launcher and its features, and some bug fixes. The Pixel C has a new multi-tasking menu, new on-screen buttons, and no app tray button. Just swipe up. Lots of changes for tablets on Android 7.1.2 Tablets will be vastly improved with Android 7.1.2 Nougat. On the Pixel C we have a new multi-window mode with easy to see windows. Push and hold to swipe each window to the left or right (which are now shaded) for split-screen multi-tasking, and running two apps at once. How to Get it Right Now Leading up to the April 3rd release 7.1.2 was only available through the beta channel. However, it’s now officially available for a slew of devices. We’re seeing over the air updates for the Pixel and Pixel XL, and the Pixel C tablet. All other devices can wait for the over the air update, or download it manually. Owners who’d rather not wait and want to manually install the official Android 7.1.2 Nougat update can do so. Click here for the factory image files, or download the OTA update files and install them with this guide. Android 7.1.2 Nougat Release Details The update to Android 7.1.2 Nougat for everyone was released on April 3rd. That was a date being tossed around, and now it’s finally here. For the most part this is just a small maintenance release, but Nexus 5X or 6P owners will love the few new features. Head into Settings > Moves to see what’s new.  Expect the over the air update notification sometime within the next two weeks for Android 7.1.2 Nougat. Google rolls these out slowly with a small percentage of owners first, then gradually over a two week period. This is to ensure a smooth transition, and to catch any potential show-stopping bugs. Owners can head into Settings > About phone (or tablet) and check for updates to download the official android 7.1.2 Nougat update today. Once the rollout has completed expect manufacturers like Samsung, LG and Motorola can get busy working on the latest version. As of right now almost all devices are on Android 7.0 Nougat, not even 7.1.1, so we still have a little wait for the latest and greatest. One Response 04/13/2017 Gabriel Reply This article doesn’t mention something I was hoping to find out more about. When I recently spoke with a Pixel support agent he warned me that the 7.1.2 public release would take 2-3 hours to load and install OVER WIFI. He discouraged trying to do it without wifi, and suggested having your phone at least 75% charged and unplugged. I didn’t ask why unplugged –distinct from Apple which suggests the opposite– but I’m wondering if, between the heat generated during recharging and that during the update, this could be a problem. I figured that 10 days after the public release I would find reviews of user experiences, but no link showed up in my search results. I was just offered the update yesterday on my Verizon purchased Pixel. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website
gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Data Analyst Reveals the Secret to Highly Successful Reddit Comments Bryan MenegusYesterday 4:00pm Filed to: first lol1!11!1 reddit data max woolf dataisbeautiful google bigquery 48 1 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Crunching the numbers on the millions upon millions of Reddit comments just to crack the code on upvotes would be difficult work. Thankfully, two software engineers, a Google big data project, and some careful analysis have already done the heavy lifting, revealing the simple trick to getting the top comment in most threads: get there first. Advertisement Jason Michael Baumgartner of Pushshift.io has been sporadically releasing databases of Reddit’s trove of comments, and last November Max Woolf ran that mass of data through Google’s BigQuery to answer a question that had been posited by another Redditor: What percentage of top comments are the first comment? The answer BigQuery spat back out was a sizable 17.24 percent. Extend that range to the first five comments and it covers a whopping 56 percent. It’s perfectly intuitive: The first comments get a head start on gathering upvotes, and upvotes signal quality to people who don’t have the time or patience to scroll farther into what are perceived as less valuable responses. Image: llewellynjean from r/dataisbeautiful, based on work by Max Woolf “Because first comments carry so much weight, it provides a bias toward power users who are on Reddit all the time,” Woolf told Gizmodo over email. A recent update to his work by redditor llewellynjean “is the same and has the same percentage breakpoints,” according to Woolf. Partly that’s because a few more months of comments are a drop in the bucket for a dataset of this size, though Reddit also hasn’t done any major overhaul of their comment sorting algorithm that we’ve been privy to. Advertisement While Reddit prides itself on being highly democratic and community-driven, the numbers indicate that the success of comments isn’t driven by their conversational value so much as by who had the time to camp out on a subreddit’s new submissions and plant their flag first. “Dramatically increase the weighting of new comments such that they are more likely to be seen, even in megacrowded threads,” is the solution Woolf suspects might unmire comments from favoring speed over quality, though he seemed skeptical a change would ever be implemented. “From Reddit’s perspective, it’s possible they may not want newer comments to have a chance to be seen,” he wrote, “because proven-comments are safer and may drive more engagement.” Woolf and llewellynjean’s data only pulls from threads with at least 30 parent-level comments (those replying directly to the post), and doesn’t factor in child-level comments (those replying to other commenters). Many subreddits also feature automated responses that post instantly and aren’t heavily voted on, which might also skew the results somewhat. As a sober, non-exhaustive analysis though, it provides some insight into yet another way to game the Frontpage of the Internet for all the comment karma it’s worth.

Generate Inquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You Technology giant Google has launched a new food delivery and home services app for the India market, christened Areo, marking its entry into the hyperlocal, on-demand services space in India. The app, which provides a range of services such as food delivery, home maintenance, fitness and electrical repairs, is operational in Bengaluru and Mumbai. Currently available on Android, Areo is not a direct service provider but an aggregator of services from local on-demand players like UrbanClap, Zimmber, Freshmenu, Box8, Holachef and Faasos, enabling consumers to schedule food deliveries or book appointments from the app. Consumers can either pay online or use the cash on delivery mode in the Areo app to pay for these services. Areo's launch will enable Google to compete with rival Facebook that began experimenting with hyperlocal services in India last year. It could also potentially infuse some fresh air into the country's online hyperlocal services market that has weathered multiple storms through the last year with many players shutting down operations while some others consolidating their operations. "We are constantly experimenting with ways to better serve our users in India," a Google spokesperson told ETtech in a statement. "In this case, Areo makes everyday chores and ordering food easier by bringing together useful local services like ordering food or hiring a cleaner in one place." The company, however, declined to comment on how these partners were selected for the initiative. The service has been live for Google employees for three months, with the tech giant footing the entire bill. Zimmber CPO Siddhartha Srivastava told ET that conversations began with Google 9-10 months ago and the search giant was keen on firms that own the delivery model and have a strong technology base. "We have invested very heavily in honing our technology integration for this platform over the last 5-6 months, which is a cost for us," Srivastava said. "We expect 10-15% of our revenues to come from Google Areo. That will be a cheaper marketing strategy for Zimmber. If they market Areo as they have done for other services or products in the past, the revenue growth (for us) could be higher." Mountain View-based Google currently does not charge any commission from its partners but may look at commissions ranging from 5-15% if the service picks up, said one of the service providers who did not wish to be named. A Google spokesperson confirmed to ET that the company is not charging partners currently but declined comment on whether it plans to charge commissions in the future. "For Faasos, we do not have discounts on Areo. In future, if there is any kind of discounting that may happen on the platform, it would be mutually decided on the basis of how the business growth targets for both players look like," said Sagar Kochhar, head of marketing at Faasos. UrbanClap declined to respond to ET's queries regarding Areo. Making its services available via the search giant’s offering should also open up a much larger audience for the partner firms and could pose serious competition to players like Zomato, Swiggy and Amazon-backed Housejoy, who are currently not present on Areo. India has also been the testing ground for several of Google's new products like YouTube Offline, Google Maps Offline and more recently YouTube Go. "Increasingly, we realise that we can try things in India — it's a quick test market — if it works, we can take it outside. Our experience with YouTube Offline worked well in India and we transitioned it to other countries," Google CEO Sundar Pichai had told ET in an interview in January.

For this initiative, Google has collaborated with five financial institutions around the world: Bank of America, USAA, Bank of New Zealand, Discover, and mBank. These institutions will now incorporate Android Pay into their mobile apps, giving users the ability to pay wirelessly at all stores and in all supported apps that accept Android Pay. A list of supported stores can be viewed at this link. Google has provided an example of how the service works, detailing how to add a card to Android Pay from the mBank app: Users will be able to use Android Pay through these banking apps even if they don't have the Android Pay app installed, with a notification being received upon completion of each transaction. Android Pay, as well as the mobile apps for the partner banks, can be downloaded for Android devices on the Play Store. Google has also ﻿ stated that it is "continuing integration with additional mobile banking apps"., though no timeline was provided.

A preview of the feature, launching in mobile search, demonstrates a search for a purse from Zara. Below the carousel of products similar to the purse is a grid of photos of various models pairing the purse with a jean jacket, gray suede boots and a pastel pink hijab. The new feature is clearly aimed at getting people looking at products to think of Google as a place to start shopping searches — and to use it instead of shopping portals like Amazon or eBay. Despite its general preeminence in search, Google lags behind Amazon when it comes to product search, and the trend is getting worse for Google. Some 55 percent of U.S. online shoppers start their search for items on Amazon, according to a survey last year by e-commerce startup BloomReach. That’s up from 44 percent when the startup did the same survey a year prior. And in that time, the percentage of shoppers who started product searches on search engines like Google fell from 34 percent to 28 percent. (Another recent survey found similar results.) It’s not just Amazon this feature seems aimed at, but also Pinterest, which offers a tool in its Chrome extension similar to Google’s new style ideas feature. Pinterest’s Chrome extension, which lets users save images they see online to Pinterest without having to return to the site, also lets users select an item and ask Pinterest to surface similar ones based on Pinterest’s image recognition software.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Google’s dedicated TensorFlow processor, or TPU, crushes Intel, Nvidia in inference workloads Google’s dedicated TensorFlow processor, or TPU, crushes Intel, Nvidia in inference workloads By Joel Hruska on April 6, 2017 at 9:48 am Comment Several years ago, Google began working on its own custom software for machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads, dubbed TensorFlow. Last year, the company announced that it had designed its own tensor processing unit (TPU), an ASIC designed for high throughput of low-precision arithmetic. Now, Google has released some performance data for their TPU and how it compares to Intel’s Haswell CPUs and Nvidia’s K80 (Kepler-based) data center dual GPU. Before we dive into the data we need to talk about the workloads Google is discussing. All of Google’s benchmarks measure inference performance as opposed to initial neural network training. Nvidia has a graphic that summarizes the differences between the two: Click to enlarge. Teaching a neural network what to recognize and how to recognize it is referred to as training, and these workloads are still typically run on CPUs or GPUs. Inference refers to the neural network’s ability to apply what it learned from training. Google makes it clear that it’s only interested in low-latency operations and that it’s imposed strict criteria for responsiveness on the benchmarks we’ll discuss below. Google’s TPU design, benchmarks The first part of Google’s paper discusses the various types of deep neural networks it deploys, the specific benchmarks it uses, and offers a diagram of the TPU’s physical layout, pictured below. The TPU is specifically designed for 8-bit integer workloads and prioritizes consistently low latency over raw throughput (both CPUs and GPUs tend to prioritize throughput over latency, particularly GPUs). Click to enlarge Google writes (PDF): “Rather than be tightly integrated with a CPU, to reduce the chances of delaying deployment, the TPU was designed to be a coprocessor on the PCIe I/O bus, allowing it to plug into existing servers just as a GPU does. Moreover, to simplify hardware design and debugging, the host server sends TPU instructions for it to execute rather than fetching them itself. Hence, the TPU is closer in spirit to an FPU (floating-point unit) coprocessor than it is to a GPU.” Click to enlarge Each TPU also has an off-chip 8GiB DRAM pool, which Google calls Weight Memory, while intermediate results are held in a 24MiB pool of on-chip memory (that’s the Unified Buffer in the diagram above). The TPU has a four-stage pipeline and executes CISC instructions, with some instructions taking thousands of clock cycles to execute as opposed to the typical RISC pipeline of one clock cycle per pipeline stage. The table below shows how the E5-2699v3 (Haswell), Nvidia K80, and TPU compare against each other in various metrics. Click to enlarge Before we hit the benchmark results, there are a few things we need to note. First, Turbo mode and GPU Boost were disabled for both the Haswell and Nvidia GPUs, not to artificially tilt the score in favor of the TPU, but because Google’s data centers prioritize dense hardware packing over raw performance. Higher turbo clock rates for the v3 Xeon are dependent on not using AVX, which Google’s neural networks all tend to use. As for Nvidia’s K80, the test server in question deployed four K80 cards with two GPUs per card, for a total of eight GPU cores. Packed that tightly, the only way to take advantage of the GPU’s boost clock without causing an overheat would have been to remove two of the K80 cards. Since the clock frequency increase isn’t nearly as potent as doubling the total number of GPUs in the server, Google leaves boost disabled on these server configurations. Google’s benchmark figures all use the roofline performance model. The advantage of this model is that it creates an intuitive image of overall performance. The flat roofline represents theoretical peak performance, while the various data points show real-world results. In this case, the Y-axis is integer operations per second, while the “Operational Intensity” X-axis corresponds to integer operations per byte of weights read (emphasis Google’s). The gap between an application’s observed performance and the curve directly above it shows how much additional performance might be gained if the benchmark was better optimized for the architecture in question, while data points on the slanted portion of the roofline indicate that the benchmark is running into memory bandwidth limitations. The slideshow below shows Google’s results in various benchmarks for its CPU, GPU, and TPU tests. As always, each slide can be clicked to open a larger image in a new window. Google’s TPU isn’t just a high performance engine; it offers substantially improved performance per watt as well, both in the original TPU and for improved variants Google has modeled (TPU’). Click to enlarge The chief limiting factor between Google’s TPU and higher performance is memory bandwidth. Google’s models show TPU performance improving 3x if memory bandwidth is increased 4x over current designs. No other set of enhancements, including clock rate improvements, larger accumulators, or a combination of multiple factors has much of an impact on performance. The last section of Google’s paper is dedicated to dispelling various fallacies and correcting misunderstandings, a number of which relate to the choice of the K80 GPU. One section is particularly worth quoting: Fallacy: CPU and GPU results would be comparable to the TPU if we used them more efficiently or compared to newer versions. We originally had 8-bit results for just one DNN on the CPU, due to the significant work to use AVX2 integer support efficiently. The benefit was ~3.5X. It was less confusing (and space) to present all CPU results in floating point, rather than having one exception, with its own roofline. If all DNNs had similar speedup, performance/Watt ratio would drop from 41-83X to 12-24X. The new 16-nm, 1.5GHz, 250W P40 datacenter GPU can perform 47 Tera 8-bit ops/sec, but was unavailable in early 2015, so isn’t contemporary with our three platforms. We also can’t know the fraction of P40 peak delivered within our rigid time bounds. If we compared newer chips, Section 7 shows that we could triple performance of the 28-nm, 0.7GHz, 40W TPU just by using the K80’s GDDR5 memory (at a cost of an additional 10W). This kind of announcement isn’t the sort of thing Nvidia is going to be happy to hear. To be clear, Google’s TPU results today are applicable to inference workloads, not the initial task of training the neural network — that’s still done on GPUs. But, with respect to Nvidia and AMD both, we’ve also seen this kind of cycle play out before. Once upon a time, CPUs were the unquestioned kings of cryptocurrency mining. Then, as difficulty rose, GPUs became dominant, thanks to vastly higher hash rates. In the long run, however, custom ASICs took over the market. Both AMD and Nvidia recently added (Nvidia) or announced (AMD) support for 8-bit operations to improve total GPU throughput in deep learning and AI workloads, but it will take significant improvements over and above these steps to address the advantage ASICs would possess if they start moving into these markets. That’s not to say we expect custom ASIC designs to own the market — Google and Microsoft may be able to afford to build their own custom hardware, but most customers won’t have the funds or expertise to take that on.

Oilers tried lame-duck approach Raiders are attempting New Aspen partnership buys Mammoth resorts, challenges Vail Resorts’ dominance in season pass sales South Boulder log home recreates feel of historic Western lodge for $6.5 million By Nate Lanxon, Charlotte Ryan and Stephanie Bodoni Bloomberg News· A Burger King television advertisement designed to trigger Google speakers in viewers’ homes leaves the search giant vulnerable to scrutiny by regulators. The 15-second commercial caused the voice-activated Google Home device to read the Wikipedia entry for the Whopper. In TV spots that aired nationally on Wednesday, a Burger King employee asked, “OK, Google. What is the Whopper burger?” and the phrase acted as a trigger for the device, until Google took steps to disable the command Wednesday. Related Articles Burger King ad threatens to renew debate over voice devices Amazon’s Alexa takes its fight with Siri to Marriott hotel rooms Starbucks launches voice ordering via app, Amazon’s Alexa Lawyers and regulators say the stunt, although it may be an effective piece of advertising, could put both the burger chain and Google at risk of legal recourse and consumer backlash. “It’s unreasonable for Google not to have appropriate mechanisms in place so that the device couldn’t be activated by a third party,” said intellectual property lawyer Faith Kasparian, from Morse, Barnes-Brown & Pendleton. “On the part of Burger King, I don’t know what they’re thinking. A reasonable person would probably not expect that a third party could activate a device like this in their home.” The FTC could have a claim against Google for the spot, on the grounds that consumers didn’t receive adequate disclosures, Kasparian said. Google has “a history with the FTC,” she said, with several consent orders issued against the company. Google could also take legal action against Burger King for “inappropriately leveraging that device,” Kasparian added. “FTC investigations are non-public, and we do not comment on an investigation or the existence of an investigation,” Juliana Gruenwald Henderson, a spokeswoman for the Federal Trade Commission, said in an emailed statement. Google declined to comment. Google Home does not distinguish between different voices speaking in its proximity. This means the device will obey any voice it hears, whether it originates from its owner or an opportunistic television commercial. A feature to identify different voices is rumored to be in development. The company specifies the current limitations in one of the printed user guides that ships with the product. “If you make your Google Home available for others to use, please be sure to let them know that their interactions may be stored by Google,” it reads, along with a web link for further information about how guests’ speech may be picked up by the gadget’s microphone. In Europe, Google Home could face increased scrutiny. European regulators have introduced new privacy rules meant to curb Google and its U.S. tech peers over their collection of data on computers and mobile phones. Voice-activated devices, like the speakers Google and Amazon sell, are likely to face additional obstacles there. Google Home is not available in Germany yet, and one of Germany’s most outspoken data protection commissioners said the regulator would “look very closely into Google Home when it comes to the German market,” following the ad controversy. “If an ‘OK Google’ is enough to send the privately spoken word across the internet to global data centers, abuses and surprises are difficult to avoid,” Johannes Caspar said in an email. The Information Commissioner’s office, a U.K. agency that oversees consumer privacy, declined to comment on Google Home. “Any organization processing personal information must comply with data protection law,” an ICO spokeswoman said in a statement. Christopher Coughlan, a lawyer specializing in data protection issues at Ashfords LLP, said U.K. regulators would “have a dim view of it.” Since the ICO named Elizabeth Denham as commissioner in July, it has issued the biggest fines in its history. Artificial intelligence and profiling in advertising is “something they are going to focus on over the next few years,” Coughlan said.

Nick Ut/AP/File | Caption Loading... Weston Williams Staff | @westonwolf359 April 13, 2017 —On Wednesday, a Burger King television ad likely became the first ever to intentionally trigger smart devices like Google Home and Android phones. In the commercial, an actor faces the camera and clearly enunciates the phrase, "Okay, Google. What is the Whopper burger?" at the end of the advertisement. Around the country, the audio clip prompted a response on a number of devices, with phones and smart speakers listing off the ingredients in the burger from the Whopper's information page on Wikipedia. The new ad, however, was not well received by all. Some saw the triggering of their devices by the ad as a nuisance, while others found the commercial to be an uncomfortable reminder of the intrusion of advertising in a world peppered with "always-listening" smart devices. Google, which had not consulted with Burger King for the commercial, disabled the Google Home's ability to be awakened by the advertisement within a day of its first airing. The response to the new ad highlights many of the concerns associated with privacy and security concerns in an increasingly digital world. But while this might be the first ad to target users who already own a Google Home or other listening smart device, privacy-invading strategies companies use to target customers are nothing new, says Saleem Alhabash, a professor of Public Relations and Social Media at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Mich. "Behavioral targeting has been applied for quite some time now," Dr. Alhabash tells The Christian Science Monitor in an email. "Advertisers, including Google, have been recording our digital traces and through algorithmic manipulation, providing us with tailored ads that are more meaningful to us." Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says The new Burger King ad is simply an extension of this general philosophy, he says. But while being on the cutting edge of new types of advertising like this can pay big dividends, it can also be risky. After all, consumer backlash can be hard to predict, especially with a new type of commercial like this. "Across different generational groups, consumers are well aware of the dangers and threats to their own security and privacy online. They know what the deal is," Alhabash adds. "In a lot of instances, they feel that protecting their privacy online is such a behemoth that they end up feeling defeated and give in to the idea of them not being able to protect their privacy. However, when an ad like the Burger King one floats to the surface, consumers are reminded of how vulnerable they are." That, he says, is part of the reason this ad has struck such a dissonant chord with many viewers. But that wasn't the only way the ad backfired. As the new commercial first began to air, many viewers realized that the information read out by Google Homes and Android devices came directly from Wikipedia, which can be edited by anyone. Soon, the description of the Whopper on the Wikipedia page was altered to contain a list of fictitious and disgusting ingredients, with one edit identifying the Whopper as "the worst hamburger product" sold by the fast food chain. Burger King quickly took steps to restore a more palatable-sounding Wikipedia entry, but before long it had encountered another problem: Google. "Google has not been consulted on this, therefore, it is not getting any of the advertising dollars spent on this ad," says Alhabash. "Google wants a piece of the pie." The tech giant found itself in the position of having its own products activated in an ad that many disliked, without any compensation. Before long, users reported that the new commercial no longer activated their Google Homes, and Burger King informed The New York Times that Google had made alterations that specifically prevented the ad's audio waking up the devices, thereby weakening the effectiveness of the new campaign. The deactivation by Google comes only a few weeks after the tech giant found itself in a similar position to Burger King when some Google Home users reacted negatively to what seemed to be a promotion for Disney's recent live-action Beauty and the Beast film tucked in between the weather and the news. The promotion, which played on a few devices on the day of the film's release, "wasn't intended to be an ad," according to a Google spokesperson. But despite the fair amount of negative feedback for this kind of invasive advertising, the new Burger King ad – as well as any copycat commercials that crop up – may yet be a success, says Jenny Olson, a professor of marketing at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kan. "From a marketing standpoint, Burger King achieved their objective of capturing consumers' attention in an increasingly saturated mediascape," Dr. Olson tells the Monitor via email. "Honestly, when I first heard about the ad (despite potential privacy concerns), my reaction was 'Wow, that's pretty clever!' This sort of advertising is something we’re going to be seeing more of as AI devices become more common in our homes." The purpose of advertising, after all, is to generate buzz – not just about the product, but also about the commercial itself – and in that regard, the invasive ad has been immensely successful, Olson says.

Burger King ad lists Whopper ingredients as cyanide, rat meat, toenail clippings By Clayton Purdom @claytonpurdom Apr 13, 2017 1:25 PM Screenshot: YouTube Screenshot: YouTube Last night Burger King released a new ad, in which a fresh-faced lad bemoans the brevity of his commercial spot but then triggers Google Homes to read the definition of a Whopper to viewers: As The Verge has pointed out, the amount of people for whom this probably worked is incredibly small—they would need to have cable and a Google Home near each other and watching it when this aired with the volume set at an appropriate level to pick up the demand. Nevertheless, it’s a creepy, fourth-wall-breaking stunt that invades viewer’s homes, and netted the expected immediate outrage online. Ad companies: “why does everyone use ad blockers?” Everyone: “INTRUSIVE ADS ARE BAD” Burger King: “Ok Google, define intrusive”— small dog friend (@duckinator) April 13, 2017 In order to make the ad work, however, Burger King had to first change Wikipedia’s definition of the Whopper to read the marketing copy: “a burger, consisting of a flame-grilled patty made with 100 percent beef with no preservatives or fillers, topped with sliced tomatoes, onions, lettuce, pickles, ketchup, and mayonnaise, served on a sesame-seed bun.” This was done under the user name Fermachado123, which is also what Burger King marketing exec Fernando Machado goes by on Twitter. Whether or not it was him is sort of moot; the entire thing is designed to go viral, and it has, but those very techniques can also be used to subvert it. Shortly after the ad premiered, people were changing the Wikipedia definition to subvert Burger King’s aim. As SPIN notes, it was first changed from Burger King’s “signature” burger to its “worst” burger, then dubbed a “cancer-causing” burger. Later it was described as “a juicy 100 percent rat meat and toenail clipping hamburger product” and then rejiggered, as captured by Business Insider, to this: Google killed Burger King’s newest TV ad that had a disastrous flaw pic.twitter.com/LJUjpunnEF— Business Insider (@businessinsider) April 13, 2017 As of press time, it has this clinical definition: So: Who’s hungry for a registered global trademark?

Meanwhile, long-struggling competitors in the digital ad market are seizing the moment. MediaMath Inc., a New York seller of software for automated online ad buying, is introducing a service to ensure that ads only run alongside hand-picked, “high quality” content. The “curated market” offering comes amid concern over some big brand ads appearing against racist, violent and offensive YouTube videos. “We’re developing for the largest brands in the world who need to be assured of a safe environment for digital advertising,” said Erich Wasserman, MediaMath’s co-founder. “We’re happily able to do this at a time when the market is shouting for it.” Google has tried to silence the shouting. After the first wave of advertiser defections, Google introduced new controls to address the problem. When more advertisers left, Google added even more features and shifted resources into new technology that flags offensive videos and disables ads on them. TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Business news first: Sign in for newsletters Most analysts believe the YouTube boycott will have minimal impact on Google sales. Its draw is too large to keep advertisers away permanently, and the boycott has not stopped search ads, Google’s bedrock. Yet some marketing agencies and advertisers are reevaluating buying plans, cognizant of the harm poor ad placement can cause. That adds pressure on Google, the biggest division of Mountain View’s Alphabet. “If you can create a driverless car and artificial intelligence, you can figure out how to keep a brand safe,” Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble Co., said at an interview during an advertising conference last week in Los Angeles. On Wednesday, NBCUniversal announced a deal with mobile ad company Kargo Global Inc. to place ads on 300 premium digital properties from 70 media companies. Persuading advertisers to pay up for premium content was a feat, given the discounts and wide distribution that giants like Google offer, said Kargo CEO Harry Kargman. The YouTube boycott was a gift. “We were prepared for a drawn-out fight,” he said. “Basically, the market has done it for us.” MediaMath, too, views its new service as responding to a market shift. The YouTube crisis wasn’t just a backlash against Google, it was a protest against the pitfalls of automated advertising in general — the systems and services that let marketers accurately target consumers but also sprinkle ads everywhere across the web. MediaMath said its new service will limit that sprinkling, sending ads to websites and online videos that it constantly monitors for quality. The company said it has 7,000 advertisers and 500 publishers on board with the service, although it declined to share its pricing or early revenue figures. It’s likely that shifts in digital spending away from Google, if any, would not appear until later in the year. However, some ad companies said they are seeing efforts to realign spending now to avoid the YouTube fracas. Charles Gabriel, president of Apester, which makes interactive software for publishers, said that over the past two weeks marketers began requesting safety controls on all online videos where they run ads. Google executives have argued that, given YouTube’s size, brand safety guarantees for every single video are impossible. But they’ve reassured marketers the issue will subside. Tara Walpert Levy, Google’s vice president of agency and media solutions, told the audience in Los Angeles that many advertisers that left over the issue have returned. But only Johnson & Johnson has said so publicly. At the conference, attitudes about the YouTube scandal were mixed. Some echoed P&G’s Pritchard. But others dismissed it as an inflated scandal, driven by the television industry, which is hosting its annual ad price-negotiation conference soon. Michael Roth, head of ad giant Interpublic Group of Cos., admitted as much on stage. Much of the YouTube hubbub, he said, was a behind-the-scenes negotiation from the older industry to compete with technology upstarts. That leverage, along with pressure from others, is necessary given the rising digital dominance of Google and Facebook. “When it’s a duopoly, you always root for someone else to keep them honest,” he said.

When Google launched its YouTube Kids service, allowing parents to control what their children watch, it marked Silicon Valley’s biggest step in gaining a lucrative and an untapped children’s market. (Gary Reyes/Bay Area News Group) By Larry Magid | larry@larrymagid.com | PUBLISHED: April 13, 2017 at 10:30 am | UPDATED: April 13, 2017 at 10:47 am I’ve long had a love-hate relationship with parental control tools that monitor or limit what kids can do with technology. I love that busy parents can access tools to help them carry out their responsibility to control when and how long their kids can use devices, and make sure they’re using them appropriately. But I hate that, over the years, some companies that market these tools use fear tactics to sell them to parents. I’m also a bit concerned about over-reliance on technology as a substitute for in-person parenting. Having said that, I’m glad to report some recent developments that help empower parents. Microsoft has recently updated its time management tools in the new Creators Edition of Windows 10, while Amazon just upgraded its FreeTime child-friendly content subscription service with a Parent Dashboard and more insight to help parents better understand the content that their kids are consuming. FreeTime requires a compatible Amazon device such as an Amazon Fire Tablet. Starting at $39.95,  Fire Tablets represent the best-value proposition in the tablet world. There is also a $79.99 Fire Kids Edition which is ruggedized and comes with a 2-year “no questions asked” warranty if they break. Neither of these are revolutionary enhancements – both Microsoft and Amazon have long offered tools to make it relatively easy for parents to take some control over how their kids use their devices. Other major companies, including Apple and Google, also offer parental controls. Parents can turn on content and time controls on any iPhone or iPad. There are numerous third party control and monitoring tools for all platforms and, as I wrote about recently, Google has launched the ability to create accounts for kids under 13 that gives parents lots of control over how they use their compatible Android device. Check with your mobile provider to see what parental controls it offers. Some internet routers have optional built-in parental controls, which have the advantage of controlling all the devices on your home network, including TVs and game consoles. Another solution is the Circle with Disney, a $99 device that you add to your network to manage content to all your devices. Facebook has some additional privacy tools for teens under 18 as well as a parents’ portal with lots of safety, security and privacy resources including a Bullying Prevention Hub. The Google Safety Center has advice for everyone, including families. Snapchat also has an extensive safety center. Full disclosure: All three of these company’s safety centers list my Internet safety non-profit, ConnectSafely.org, among their partners and provide some financial support for the organization. There are some limitations and cautions when it comes to any parental control tool. To begin with, they only work on devices or networks that are protected. All bets are off when your kid is visiting a friend’s house. And even if you have a tight rein on your home network, it may not carry over if the child connects their device to a cellular network or another WiFi network. That’s why, speaking at conference in 1996, I made the comment, “the best internet filter is the one that runs between the child’s ears,” and that’s just as true today. No matter how hard a parent tries, it is almost impossible to use technology to completely protect a child from anything that can go wrong with their use of technology. But there is a bigger principle involved. The goal of parenting shouldn’t be to bubble-wrap our children to protect them against anything that can go wrong but rather to equip our children to make good decisions that will protect them for a lifetime. Former attorney general Dick Thornberg said it well, “One can build fences and post signs around a swimming pool to keep kids out, but the best way to keep kids from drowning is to teach them how to swim.” It’s also important to take stock of what your child needs based on what you know about your child, not what some parental control vendor tells you. Consider your child’s age, maturity level and the type of risks they are likely to take. Products to monitor or control internet or mobile use may be necessary for some kids, but not for all. Studies have shown that kids who get into some type of trouble online are often risk-takers in other aspects of their lives as well. And if you think a monitoring program will stop cyberbullying, consider that most bullying takes place in-person and not online, and even when it is online (or mobile) it is often a reflection of what’s going on at school or wherever kids are hanging out. Finally, remember that our role as parents isn’t just to raise kids, it’s also to raise adults. With any luck our kids will leave the house sooner or later and our job is to equip them to make good decisions when we’re not around. That’s why, even if you use controls, I urge parents to wean their kids off them during their teen years and encourage that filter between their ears to take over. I also urge parents to avoid using any monitoring software that runs in “stealth mode.” If you are going to install or turn on parental control tools, tell your kids what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. It’s good for family dynamics and, if you do ever find something that you need to discuss with them, their first reaction won’t be to ask why you’re spying on them.     Tags:  Family Personal Technology Larry Magid Larry Magid is a tech journalist & internet safety activist.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Find Third-Party Services to Use With Google Home By Eric Ravenscraft on April 13th, 2017 Google Home brings a lot of the awesome features of Google Assistant to your living room. Developers can also add new features, making Google Home’s potential virtually limitless. You don’t even have to install a thing. Here’s how to find and use third-party services. Unlike the Amazon Echo, where third party “skills” must be enabled one-by-one, Google’s third-party apps (called “services”) are all enabled by default. If you can think of Google Home like your own personal assistant, then talking to a service is like asking your assistant to call someone else for you. So, for example, if you want to add an item to your Todoist app, you can say “Ok Google, ask Todoist to add a task to buy milk.” Google will pass your request on to the Todoist service, which will take care of your command for you. You can also say “Ok Google, let me talk to Todoist” to connect with the service directly. That way you can ask Todoist to do multiple things without going through Google each time. This system is a little confusing, but once you get used to it, it’s a little easier than installing an app or enabling a service for everything you want to do with Google Home. You may need to link your account for some services (like Todoist), but others work immediately even if you’ve never interacted with them before. Of course, you’ll need to know what kind of services exist, first, and what they’re named. To find third-party Google Home services, open up your Google Home app and tap the menu button in the top-right corner. Then, tap “More settings.”   Scroll down and find Services in the list and tap on it. Here, you’ll find a large list of third-party services in alphabetical order. Unfortunately, Google hasn’t made it easy to search these services. There aren’t even ratings or reviews, so you can see which ones suck. On the upside, the list is pretty short right now. There are only a couple hundred services, so you can scroll through to find the ones you might care about relatively quickly. Still, Google…get on top of this before it gets out of hand. For most of these services, you can simply browse to see what types of voice commands are available. Tap the service and you’ll see a description, plus a few sample commands. Some, however, also require you to link your external account before you can use them. To link your account, tap on the service from the list, find the Link Account button and tap it. Then sign in. Once you’re done, you can speak to your Google Home using the voice commands for that service.   Many of the services are garbage—like a “Never have I ever” game or the many, many quote bots—but there are a few that are worthwhile. For example, the AutoVoice service lets you send voice commands to Android automation tool Tasker. Domino’s lets you order pizza, Genius helps you look up song lyrics, and Uber lets you call a cab. Take a look through the list, and you’ll probably find at least a few services that can make your Google Home even more useful.

Now we are on the cusp of a new grand leap thanks to the democratization of machine learning and artificial intelligence already underway, according to this opinion piece by Kartik Hosanagar (@khosanagar), Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions, and a cofounder of Yodle Inc., and, Apoorv Saxena (@apoorvsaxena1), a product manager at Google and co-chair of the recent AI Frontiers conference. Last month, at the CloudNext conference in San Francisco, Google announced its acquisition of Kaggle, an online community for data scientists and machine-learning competitions. Although the move may seem far removed from Google’s core businesses, it speaks to the skyrocketing industry interest in machine learning (ML). Kaggle not only gives Google access to a talented community of data scientists, but also one of the largest repositories of datasets that will help train the next generation of machine-learning algorithms. As ML algorithms solve bigger and more complex problems, such as language translation and image understanding, training them can require massive amounts of pre-labeled data. To increase access to such data, Google had previously released a labeled dataset created from more than 7 million YouTube videos as part of their YouTube-8M challenge on Kaggle. The acquisition of Kaggle is an interesting next step. Market-based access to data and algorithms will lower entry barriers and lead to an explosion in new applications of AI. As recently as 2015, only large companies like Google, Amazon and Apple had access to the massive data and computing resources needed to train and launch sophisticated AI algorithms. Small startups and individuals simply didn’t have access and were effectively blocked out of the market. That changes now. The democratization of ML gives individuals and startups a chance to get their ideas off the ground and prove their concepts before raising the funds needed to scale. But access to data is only one way in which ML is being democratized. There is an effort underway to standardize and improve access across all layers of the machine learning stack, including specialized chipsets, scalable computing platforms, software frameworks, tools and ML algorithms. “Just like cloud computing ushered in the current explosion in startup … machine learning platforms will likely power the next generation of consumer and business tools.” Specialized chipsets Complex machine-learning algorithms require an incredible amount of computing power, both to train models and implement them in real time. Rather than using general-purpose processors that can handle all kinds of tasks, the focus has shifted towards building specialized hardware that is custom built for ML tasks. With Google’s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) and NVIDIA’s DGX-1, we now have powerful hardware built specifically for machine learning. Sponsored Content: Highly scalable computing platforms Even if specialized processors were available, not every company has the capital and skills needed to manage a large-scale computing platform needed to run advanced machine learning on a routine basis. This is where public cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and others come in. These services offer developers a scalable infrastructure optimized for ML on rent and at a fraction of the cost of setting up on their own. Open-source, deep-learning software frameworks A major issue in the wide-scale adoption of machine learning is that there are many different software frameworks out there. Big companies are open sourcing their core ML frameworks and trying to push for some standardization. Just as the cost of developing mobile apps fell dramatically as iOS and Android emerged as the two dominant ecosystems, so too will machine learning become more accessible as tools and platforms standardize around a few frameworks. Some of the notable open source frameworks include Google’s TensorFlow, Amazon’s MXNet and Facebook’s Torch. Developer-friendly tools The final step to democratization of machine learning will be the development of simple drag-and-drop frameworks accessible to those without doctorate degrees or deep data science training. Microsoft Azure ML Studio offers access to many sophisticated ML models through a simple graphical UI. Amazon and Google have rolled out similar software on their cloud platforms as well. Marketplaces for ML algorithms and datasets Not only do we have an on-demand infrastructure needed to build and run ML algorithms, we even have marketplaces for the algorithms themselves. Need an algorithm for face recognition in images or to add color to black and white photographs? Marketplaces like Algorithmia let you download the algorithm of choice. Further, websites like Kaggle provide the massive datasets one needs to further train these algorithms. “The final step to democratization of machine learning will be the development of simple drag-and-drop frameworks accessible.” All of these changes mean that the world of machine learning is no longer restricted to university labs and corporate research centers that have access to massive training data and computing infrastructure. What are the implications? Back in the mid- and late-1990s, web development was done by specialists and was accessible only to firms with ample resources. Now, with simple tools like WordPress, Medium and Shopify, any lay person can have a presence on the web. The democratization of machine learning will have a similar impact of lowering entry barriers for individuals and startups. Further, the emerging ecosystem, consisting of marketplaces for data, algorithms and computing infrastructure, will also make it easier for developers to pick up ML skills. The net result will be lower costs to train and hire talent. We think that the above two factors will be particularly powerful in vertical (industry-specific) use cases such as weather forecasting, healthcare/disease diagnostics, drug discovery and financial risk assessment that have been traditionally cost prohibitive. Just like cloud computing ushered in the current explosion in startups, the ongoing build-out of machine learning platforms will likely power the next generation of consumer and business tools. The PC platform gave us access to productivity applications like Word and Excel and eventually to web applications like search and social networking. The mobile platform gave us messaging applications and location-based services. The ongoing democratization of ML will likely give us an amazing array of intelligent software and devices powering our world.

Home About Testimonials News Widget Guidelines Syndicate faq Blog Contact     RemoveSlander.com Release 3 Steps To Protect Your Privacy From Trump Bill S.J.Res. 34 RemoveSlander.com release 3 way to protect your online privacy from internet search providers. Online PR News – 13-April-2017 – New York, New York – The CEO of RemoveSlander.com says the Trump Administration has just made it a lot easier for annoying mugshot websites to gain access to booking photos, and arrests information. CEO Tyronne Jacques said over the past 36 months his firm started to see a decline in the number of third party mugshot websites, however in recent weeks since President Trump signed S.J.Res.34, there has been a spike in the number of new sites appearing in Google, sites with no removal option. How S.J.Res. 34 Leaves You Exposed? On March 28, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law S.J.Res. 34, which nullifies the Federal Communications Commission's final rule titled Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunication Services. Previously under the Obama Administration, several protections were put in place to limit internet service providers like Google, Facebook, and Yahoo from selling information like browser history, and search results but the Trump Administration has just removed all of those protections with one swoop of his presidential pen. In a recent interview with the CEO of RemoveSlander.com, he says all of the progress that was achieved in the banishing of 3rd party websites that monetize public records have been tossed out of the window, leaving arrested individuals exposed with zero right to privacy. Arrest information has just doubled in value for data mining servicing seeking to sell public records to lead generating services similar to those patronized by Attorneys. “The signing of S.J.Res.34 symbolizes the return of the Wild Wild West in terms of Internet Privacy, and the right to be forgotten. President Trump has just legalized the Big Brother scenario thus empowering service providers to profit from everything published about you online, including your mugshot photo.” “Always keep in mind that your name is your brand, and just like large corporations protect their brand with PR Firms, you too have that same right to hire an Internet Publicist like RemoveSlander.com.” Tyronne Jacques went on to say that there is no such thing anymore as privacy especially when it comes to public records, therefore if you have concerns about photos and links appearing online, then the time is now to delete as much of your search history as possible. “My firm was the first to offer search history removal long before the emergence of mugshot websites, as a matter of fact in 2010 there was only one site in Florida that published booking photos. Fast forward to 2017; there are now dozens of websites profiting from the republishing of public records. This new bill signed into law has just rendered all State Legislation attempting to reform the abuse of Transparency Laws irrelevant.” The CEO of RemoveSlander.com suggested three steps you can take today that would help in guarding your sensitive information against Internet service providers. 1. Create profiles with pseudonyms to protect your birth name from information contained in your search history. This new bill gives internet service providers the right to sell the content in your emails without your permission, therefore creating a pseudonym will add the first layer of privacy. 2. Be mindful not to visit sites that could eventually prove embarrassing if there is ever a hack, like the one witnessed at Yahoo in 2016, and Dolly Madison in 2015. The internet has changed which means that your search behavior also has to change if you’re logged into Google or Yahoo using your birth name. 3. Finally, attack humiliating links on the first page of your Google search results with a relentless vengeance. Many people have the misconception that negative items will naturally expire or fade away over time, this is far from reality. The truth about malicious websites like Whopostedbail.org and Florida.Arrests.org is those links will remain at the top of your search results until steps are taken to have them deleted. CEO Tyronne Jacques went on to say that your arrest information is very valuable to companies who profit off ad revenue. With the passage of S.J.Res.34 there is now zero incentive for mugshot websites to remove content published about your arrests because, that booking information could prove more valuable to a DUI Attorney in need of leads. A fourth and final tip the CEO of RemoveSlander.com shared with us is you have the right to protect yourself from the internet. That right includes hiring a firm like RemoveSlander.com to target and remove any link that is a violation of your privacy. The CEO of RemoveSlander.com suggest that a great starting point to gather as much information about published mugshots is to search Google and add the word ‘Mugshot’ to the end of your name. In doing so, he says that Google or Yahoo will return results that best match – and give you the opportunity to target for removal all of the mugshot links at once. About Internet Publicist RemoveSlander.com Founded in 2009 as a Cyber Bully protection firm, RemoveSlander.com has assisted thousands of clients in protecting their search history from Internet Service Providers and Third Party Data Mining Websites. In 2012 RemoveSlander.com provided expert analysts for ABC World News in their coverage of the Rising Mugshot Industry. Based out of New Orleans Louisiana and still privately own, RemoveSlander.com has perfected the art of removing embarrassing links and photos from the internet as well as the promotion of positive publicity for their clients. “Always keep in mind that your name is your brand, and just like large corporations protect their brand with PR Firms, you too have that same right to hire an Internet Publicist like RemoveSlander.com.” He concluded.

Your flexible SEO strategy: Creation, execution and measurement in an ever-changing environment Columnist Janet Driscoll Miller discusses some of the top challenges SEOs are facing today and outlines why an SEO strategy has to be a living document that changes based on search trends and algorithm updates. Janet Driscoll Miller on April 13, 2017 at 9:41 am More Like any marketing channel, SEO is an investment. Whether you’re using in-house resources or hiring an agency to do the work, SEO isn’t free. To make the most of your SEO time (and perhaps direct financial) investment, it’s helpful to have an SEO strategy established to be your road map for execution. However, one of the bigger challenges to creating an SEO strategy is that the search engines (primarily Google) are shifting ranking factors and introducing new updates fairly regularly. Therefore, an SEO strategy has to be a living document, allowing for regular modifications as search engine requirements change. Those strategy or tactic changes then need to be communicated with the appropriate team members. SEO involves multiple departments and disciplines across an organization — it’s larger than just the marketing department. For instance, nearly four years ago, Google indicated that links in press releases should be nofollow. In cases like that, the SEO manager would need to communicate that change to the public relations team to ensure that they are aware of how to treat links in their press releases. A few weeks ago, I hosted a webinar on SEO strategy. During the presentation, I asked the attendees several questions, curious to hear why they were attending and what was impacting their current SEO strategy this year. Not surprisingly, when asked what SEO challenges they are facing today, the top two issues were keeping up with Google changes and not having enough resources to execute the SEO tactics (both 50 percent): Even as an agency owner, staying abreast of changes can be tough. At Marketing Mojo, I hold a news briefing for 15 minutes every morning to update the staff on all of the changes in the past 24 hours for all of the platforms we work with. And I have enough news to share every day. There’s no shortage of it! And if you’re handling multiple marketing responsibilities, such as email marketing, advertising and more, it can be tough to stay up to date on all of the different channels you’re working with. And it’s no surprise that resources to execute the SEO are also challenging to come by. With SEO touching so many aspects of an organization’s marketing-related activities, it literally takes a village to execute on all of the SEO efforts that need to occur around the company. Also daunting, however, are managing expectations (40 percent) and showing value for SEO (38 percent), which brings us back to the ROI conversation. SEO takes time, but not every CEO has the background understanding or patience to wait for results. Ahrefs recently put out a study on how long it takes for a new web page to rank in the top 10 results on Google. One of my favorite charts from that study focuses on the search volume of the keyword in the search query and where pages ranked after one year based on the search volume of the keyword: Google also recently put out a video which may be helpful for you to set SEO expectations with management. In the video, Maile Ohye describes how to hire an SEO, and she indicates that you should expect it to take from four to 12 months to begin to see changes after SEO efforts have been applied to a page: Hopefully, these two resources can help you to set reasonable expectations with management. Showing value, however, has its own unique set of challenges. When our webinar attendees were surveyed, one-third indicated that measuring SEO value for the organization is difficult because the SEO team doesn’t always own revenue data and other information required to truly track the ROI for SEO: Often, marketers may not have access to certain platforms, such as CRM systems, accounting systems and more, that often house transactional and revenue data. Without access to revenue data, marketers are challenged to demonstrate a channel’s business value. Further, without demonstrating measurable ROI, how can an SEO make the business case for additional resources to execute all of the SEO tactics? It’s really a catch-22. When it comes to measuring ROI for SEO, I generally recommend the “crawl before you walk” approach. Don’t try to do it all overnight, but go as far as you can with measurement. I created a downloadable ROI workbook in Excel that will help you auto calculate your ROI for any channel. If you can’t fill in all of the columns now, it’s OK! Just go as far as you can to the right of the workbook. The more data you can fill in, the closer you will get to measuring your true SEO ROI and value. And in the meantime, you can see what data you’re missing — and you can ask for that specific data from its owner. Finally, we asked respondents how often they update their SEO strategy: I was surprised to learn that 33 percent have never reviewed their SEO strategy. Given the rapid pace of change in organic search, I certainly wouldn’t have expected such a high percentage. But it’s easy to feel lost when you’re lacking resources or don’t have confidence in your measurements. How can you have an effective strategy if you can’t measure the outcome of your efforts? While you’re creating your SEO strategy and updating it regularly, make sure that you also are auditing your analytics and tracking regularly. Be sure to educate your team about documentation and using features like Google Analytics’ annotations, so that when changes are made to the tracking, you can see why certain anomalies may exist in your dataset. Also consider how you currently track your marketing channels. If you’re a B2B, for instance, and use a CRM tool, are you tracking the lead source of organic search? How often does the lead source field update? Consider your attribution method. Once you have thorough tracking in place and have confidence in your data, forming, an effective strategy (and tactics to support that strategy) will be easier to measure as you regularly adapt the strategy to the meet the changing requirements of the search engines.

It debuted at Videotron and Freedom Mobile — where it was the one and only device compatible with the carrier’s new LTE network at launch — and has since broadened its reach to Bell, Rogers and Fido. In my first review, I painted a conflicted view of the LG V20 — it was good, but not good enough to compete with the greats (its top competitors at the time being the iPhone 7 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 7). My sentiments were shared, in many ways, by other reviewers, but it’s important to note that most reviewers, including myself, spent the majority of their time with a ‘pre-production’ model of the LG V20 — so a revisit after spending significant time with the production model was long overdue. A lot has changed since then, however. The Note 7 exploded (literally), Apple users lamented ‘the dongle life,’ the Google Pixel launched, Samsung is preparing to rollout its redemption flagship, the Samsung Galaxy S8, and LG debuted its newest flagship, the LG G6. So where does this leave the LG V20? I’ll address that question in this revisit, as well as provide my insights based on three weeks of use with the in-market device. The first thing I noticed switching from the Google Pixel to the LG V20 was the astonishing level of audio quality provided by its 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC (digital-to-analog converter). I spoke highly of the V20’s audio in my review — but I’m not sure I properly gushed. So allow me to now: the quality of sound when listening to music through the Bang & Olufsen BEOPLAY H3 earbuds (provided to me by LG) is astonishing. The clear articulation and immersive quality of the sound turns listening to music into an experience all its own. I have literally sat at home, doing nothing but listening to music with the LG V20. If you’re an audiophile, you won’t get better than the LG V20 and even if you aren’t, you’ll still notice the difference. That brings us to the other main value proposition of this multimedia device, its extensive camera package. When stacking the LG V20’s camera up against other premium devices, I still question whether it can compete — though at least there’s been no more crashing. From a hardware perspective, LG did everything right with its rear-facing camera setup. It has a 16 megapixel rear camera with f/1.8 aperture and OIS (75-degree lens), as well as 8-megapixel rear camera with f/2.4 aperture (135-degree lens), allowing for wide-angle shots that let you to capture more than your eye can physically see. This is an incredibly handy feature, as often when I’m taking snaps I envision the picture being bigger than what a regular mobile camera generally frames. Where the camera strays from excellence is in its indoor and low-light photography. With limited or indoor lighting, photos come out in soft definition and with poor colour saturation. This is particularly true when not using wide-angle mode — the same situation comes out with much less colour saturation. I’ve managed to take some great photos in ideal lighting, but I often find myself in situations where I’m in mediocre indoor light and regret that I don’t have the LG V20 and not the Google Pixel or a premium Samsung or Apple device on me. From a design perspective, I’m always proud to tote the V20. Its minimal, all-metal and the secondary display adds a bit of flash (more on that later). One important thing to note, however, is that it features a wide at 78.1mm. If you have short thumbs, you’ll have a difficult time reaching to the other edge of the device, often necessitating two-handed use or leading to dangerous drops. As a side note, I’d also like to mention that the V20 tough and looks a lot better after drops than the Google Pixel does. I didn’t experience the same issue when testing out the 68.1mm-wide Samsung Galaxy S8, which still manages to offer a bigger display than the V20; 5.8-inches to the V20’s 5.7-inches. The LG G6 offers an improvement — though more minor than Samsung’s — in that category as well, with a 71.9mm width and 5.7-inch display. At 67.1mm wide, the iPhone 7 is far reduced from the V20 and even the iPhone 7 Plus comes in at a smaller 77.9mm. As for the double screen, I’m backtracking on its usefulness. Throughout the two weeks I’ve spent using the LG V20, I’ve never once found an instance in which I’ve found it added to the phone’s experience. When I want to see the time, my natural instinct is to wake my phone, which is easily done with two taps on the display. When it comes to quick-launching apps, the little screen is too small for my fingers to reliably tap the correct app, so instead I tend to avoid the lineup in favour of my regular browsing habits. Beyond all that, the second screen is too high up to easily reach while using the V20 in one hand. When I was working hard to use the feature at the beginning of my time with the V20, I saw potential, but now that I’m deeper into daily use I just can’t see the point. In my original review when I spoke about performance I noted that most of the time it ran superbly on its Snapdragon 820 chipset and 4GB of RAM, but then sometimes, often randomly, apps would crash. That issue has persisted, with the same apps that I noted before: Apple Music and Google Maps, as well as the Google Play Store. Additionally, I’ve run into several instances where apps haven’t loaded properly or took a long time to load. I should specify, this isn’t a rampant issue, but it does happen more than most other Android flagships I’ve tried with the Snapdragon 820 chipset, including the Samsung Galaxy S7 and HTC 10. The battery life provided via the LG V20’s 3,200mAh unit is, in my use case, a full day — but just by a small margin. Most of the time, when 9pm rolls around, the phone’s about to die or has just died. My usage, I’d say, is medium-high. Multiple hours of music streaming (both on data and Wi-Fi) and two hours or so of data browsing are my most energy consumptive practices. For most premium smartphone users, a day’s battery life is standard, though, and while other flagships may give you a bit more to run into a long night, typically you’ll be plugging in during the evening either way, so it’s not a big downside. The phone continues to run a little hot when charging, however. As for the user experience, time has not improved my relationship with LG’s UX 5.0+ skin. I still find it to be too invasive, in both form and function and would prefer a stripped down, near stock Android experience. For instance, I find if unfortunate that you can’t swipe right to get to the Google Now screen from home. Instead, you either see a stretchy screen animation or can enable ‘Smart Bulletin,’ an LG proprietary feature that shows you your calendar and provides you with access to ‘LG Health,’ ‘QuickRemote,’ ‘Evernote,’ ‘Smart Settings’ and LG’s music app. The feature, as you might be able to tell from its offerings, does little to replicate Google Now’s handy functionalities. While I consider that a major downside, if you care little about stock Android — or have never experienced it before — this may not be a point of consideration for you. After all, there’s nothing intrinsically broken about the skin. It just pales in comparison to the simplicity and ease of use that users can experience with an iPhone or Pixel. In sum, my perspective hasn’t greatly changed. The LG V20 is still a great phone, but not great enough to knock anyone off their pedestals in any category except for audio and, unfortunately for the company, great audio isn’t generally what sells phones. Keep a look out for our LG G6 review, coming soon, to see if the manufacturer can surpass the G5 and V20 to create a compelling all-around premium smartphone package.

There are features that are unique, and that make the use of phone much simpler and easier than Pixel: second screen, knock-on display, mini-view are some of them. Since OS itself has been polished and more mature and hardware performance is now at the level enough to overcome the additional resource usage of custom Androids, I don’t see advantages of a stock Android over well-customized version. paulnptld I never understand why people fail to address how you can use custom launchers to make the experience pretty much perfect. “The LG skin, blah, blah…” Use Nova or Apex. Customize. Enjoy. Angelbob77 Yes I absolutely agree I don’t really like the pixel because other than its software there is nothing really impressive about it. And since I could care less about software because I use Nova launcer, I got the v20 due to the removable battery. Tim3Tripp3r It seems very odd that you left out the fact that the V20 is MIL-STD-810G transit drop compliance. This means with the LG V20’s MIL-STD-810G rating, it entails drops. More specifically, the V20 survived 26 drops from a height of 4 feet. I find this highly relevant to being included in a review. Being “rugged” is way more important than being waterproof to my use. 1messager You should made the dimensions comparaison with the same kind of measure. Don Low The V20 is a great phone. Second screen is very useful. Try to replace the battery in any of the others, you can’t. Rose Beher is the type that should just stick to the iPhone. Typical Apple Fritter… James Her largest criticism was the LG skin instead of stock Android. “Apple Fritter”. Typical Mobilesyrup comment. Barry Plunkett I love my LG V20! Great battery life never over heats but the main reason I bought it was for the removable battery and Great Pictures. Try that in the other phone’s! LOL! Never worry about running out of power I keep a spare battery with me at all times. James Watt I am also a medium-high (probably on the high end) user and notice the battery life issue, especially on days I’m using the camera. However, it’s a great camera. I bought a battery charger that can last me longer than 2 days. Is it a large external battery? Sure, but the battery is also removable so I have options. I’d rather have enough power than not enough. Another feature I use is the HD audio recorder. It’s better than headphones for recording so I’ll take it. My job doesn’t need high quality microphones but this works perfectly. I’m a niche market there but I appreciate it.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Google Google is already your first stop for info on, well, anything, but now, the search engine is making a change to become your go-to for style inspiration, too. On Thursday, Google Image Search announced the launch of "Style Ideas," a new feature that will provide users searching for fashion-related products with "inspirational lifestyle images and outfits that showcase how the product can be worn in real life." Julia Enthoven, associate product manager at Google, explains in a blog post that "Style Ideas" will allow users to visualize whatever item they're perusing in a street-style context. Sort of like Pinterest, no? Enthoven writes, "With style ideas, you can see real-life options of what bag and jeans look stellar with those red high heels you’ve been eyeing. Or if running gear is more your speed, no sweat—workout ensemble ideas are just a tap away." Another aspect of the new feature: Google will show users items similar to the ones they're searching for, which could be useful for scouting those covetable fashions at a lower price. According to TechCrunch, the images shown in both "Style Ideas" and as "similar items" are determined by an algorithm, which prioritizes images that are from sources focused on a specific product type, appear as a complete look, and are from authoritative sites. Share via PinterestGoogle These new features are available in the Google Search app if you have an Android phone, and they can be accessed via Safari and Chrome on any mobile device. Now BRB, off to lose ourselves in a very stylish Google Image Search black hole.

What is Google Daydream? Share twitter linkedin facebook google+ email Clare Hopping In-depth 13 Apr, 2017 We explain everything you need to know about Google Daydream, Google’s virtual reality platform It would seem almost every tech company has seen the opportunity offered by virtual reality, with many of the big names acquiring smaller companies with VR focus and making it one of their priorities for the future. Google is no different, launching Google Daydream, its virtual reality platform and Daydream View, its very own virtual reality headset for taking a peep at the virtual worlds. Although Google hasn’t positioned its VR offering at any particular market (HTC Vive, for example takes aim at the gaming market with its tie up with Steam), that could be a good thing, keeping the platform just as open as its Android operating system. We explain everything you need to know about the technology and why it’s taking on the big players like Oculus (now owned by Facebook) . Google Daydream history Google Daydream was announced at the Google I/O  developer conference in May 2016, with the Daydream View launched in November. But, like all good things, the platform took quite a while to get to the point it could launch as a serious virtual reality platform. You may remember Google Cardboard - the company’s first attempts at getting augmented reality into the mainstream. Well, Google Daydream is the follow on from that and Google has applied lots of key learnings, including the lightweight headset and the need for a good apps store to go with it. As a result of its efforts with Google Cardboard, the company opened up its platform to third party developers to bring their apps to the platform too back in January, hoping to make it as popular as its Android App Store. What does Google Daydream do? Google Daydream brings together Android-powered smartphones and virtual reality, making it simple for users to access content on their device and turn it into a virtual world with a viewer. Google Daydream also includes a store where you can download for free and buy various apps for your Daydream View and content, such as videos. Everything can be accessed while wearing a VR headset, so it’s not surprising the UI is pretty impressive. At present, the true scope of Google Daydream hasn’t really been explored, with more developers saying they will be launching apps and games in the future. However, any early adopters will be able  to take advantage of some of the biggest apps around, including Google’s own YouTube, Google Maps Street View, Google Play Movies & TV, and Google Photos. Netflix is also available on the platform and Ubisoft has been onboarded as a partner too, meaning we can expect some awesome gaming action too. Google Daydream compatibility Google Daydream will only work with selected devices at the moment, and unsurprisingly, they’re all Android-powered devices. At the time of writing (April 2017), Google Daydream is available for use with the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, Motorola Moto Z, Asus SenFone AR and ZTE Axon 7, although Asus and Motorola devices need to be upgraded to Android Nougat before they’ll work. Similarly, the only VR device that will stream content from your device to in front of your eyes is the Daydream View, although it’s likely other Android device manufacturers, will launch their own in the future. Huawei is the most hotly tipped to release their version alongside a flagship smartphone in future. Google Daydream View The DayDream View is, at the moment, the only headset for use with Google’s Daydream VR technology. Compatible devices just slip into the front compartment and then the VR content can be viewed through the goggle-like facepiece. It’s a lightweight headset in comparison to other on the market and because it’s made from fabric rather than plastic or rubber, it’s less likely to get you sweaty if you keep it on for a long time. To suit most tastes, it’s available in a Slate grey, Crimson red or Snow White finish. It hooks up to a smartphone using NFC and capacitive nubs to make connecting a breeze. Alongside the headset, Google also launched the Daydream Controller, a wireless device for controlling the headset. It integrates proximity sensors to detect where the user’s hands are and features a touchpad, circular buttons, volume buttons and a status light.

Well, surprise! Those doodles you drew have now been used to teach Google’s AI how to draw. The resulting program is called Sketch-RNN and, frankly, it draws about as well as a toddler. But like any new parents, Google’s AI scientists are proud as punch. To create Sketch-RNN, Google Brain researchers David Ha and Douglas Eck collected more than half a million user-drawn sketches from the Google tool Quick, Draw! Each time a user drew something on the app, it recorded not only the final image, but also the order and direction of every pen stroke used to make it. The resulting data gives a more complete picture (ho, ho, ho) of how we really draw. All in all, Ha and Eck gathered 70,000 training doodles for 75 different categories, including “cat,” “firetruck,” “garden,” “owl,” “pig,” “face,” and “mermaid.” Their goal? To create a machine that can “draw and generalize abstract concepts in a manner similar to humans.” And it can! After studying this data, it learned first to draw based on human input, as seen below: The human doodles on the left; the computer’s imitations are on the right. Image: Google Notice, as seen most clearly in the penultimate row, the AI is not just copying line for line the human doodle. The input on the left-hand side shows a cat with three eyes — but the AI is copying the concept, not the sketch itself, and it knows enough to know three eyes is one too many. Next, Sketch-RNN learned to draw the objects without copying a starting sketch. (For more on how deep neural networks process and imitate data, check out our AI explainer.) From left to right: frogs, cats, and crabs. Image: Google But what’s the benefit of getting neural networks to sketch things in the first place, when they’re already pretty good at making photo-realistic images? Well, as Ha and Eck explain, although doodles look childish to us, they’re also masterpieces of abstraction and data compression. Doodles, they say, “tell us something about how people represent and reconstruct images of the world around them.” In other words, they’re more human. And once you’ve taught an AI to sketch, you can deploy it in all sorts of fun ways. Sketch-RNN can complete doodles started by someone else: And it can combine different doodles together. So, in the picture below, the neural network has been asked to draw some combination of the category “cat” and “chair.” The result? Weird cat-chair chimeras: It can also create what are called “latent space interpolations” — looking at any number of doodle subjects, and combining them together in different ratios to create new sketches with multiple characteristics. In the group of drawings on the left, below, the AI has combined four different doodles: the pig, rabbit, crab, and face. These drawings are obviously quite basic, but the methods used to create them are so interesting — and, so potentially useful. In the future, AI programs like Sketch-RNN could be used as creative aids for designers, architects, and artists. If someone is struggling with a certain picture or design, they could get an AI to absorb their work and spit out a few more suggested variations. The images the computer produces might not be useful in themselves, but they could spark something in the human. Is this AI creativity? It’s difficult to know what else to call it.

Introduction and design 2. Dazzling display, clever keyboard, tasty Marshmallow 3. Specs and performance 4. Music, Movies and Gaming 5. Battery life and camera 6. Verdict and competition Our Verdict The Google Pixel C has it all: a fantastic display, heaps of power, a premium design and a lofty price tag. The only problem is, it's up against the excellent iPad Pro. For Fantastic screen Premium design Solid power Against Heavy Keyboard is pricey option No microSD slot or 4G model Update: The Google Pixel C has a new software update, and some new competition in the iPad Pro 9.7 and Samsung Galaxy Tab S3. We've updated our Pixel C review to reflect these developments. The Pixel C was launched a little half-heartedly by Google during its Nexus 5X and 6P event back in October 2015, and since then it's seen some serious rivals show up in the form of the iPad Pro 9.7 and Samsung Galaxy Tab S3. It may be starting to show its age, but a recent software update to Android 7 Nougat has managed to keep it relevant. The Pixel C was a new venture for Google, being the first tablet designed and built by the search giant.  Previous 'Google' slates sporting the Nexus brand were been made by Asus and HTC; this time round, though, Google's had total control over every aspect, shaping the device specifically for Android. The 10.2-inch, 2560 x 1800 display and premium metal build means the Pixel C sits comfortably at the top end of the tablet market, bridging the gap between the Nexus slates and Google's Chromebook Pixel laptop. It attempts to bridge that gap with a clever keyboard dock which transforms the Pixel C from a standard Android tablet into a hybrid laptop. Google Pixel C price 64GB model: £479 ($599, around AU$820) Keyboard dock: £88 ($124, around AU$160) At launch you could pick up the Google Pixel C in two storage sizes: 32GB and 64GB.  The 32GB version set you back £399, (US$499, around AU$680), while the larger storage size is available for £479 (US$599, around AU$820). Now though, only the pricier 64GB model remains, but it's still comfortably cheaper than the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (£700, $930, AU$1,499) and (admittedly newer) iPad Pro 9.7 (£549, $599, AU$849). If you want to make the most of the Google Pixel C you'll want to pick up the Pixel C keyboard as well, which will set you back a further £88 ($124, around AU$160) - which is cheaper than the initial £119 ($149) launch price. Design There's no mistaking that the Pixel C is a premium tablet. Finished in Anodized Aluminum, the Pixel C looks and feels like an expensive piece of tech as soon as you lay eyes and hands on it. That style isn't light though, and at 517g it's considerably heavier than the similarly proportioned iPad Pro 9.7, which tips the scales at 437g – although the Pro 9.7 is shorter, narrower and thinner than the 242 x 179 x 7mm Google Pixel C. There's a healthy amount of bezel surrounding the 10.2-inch display, and considering there's no physical home key it feels like wasted space. We'd have liked a larger screen, or tighter dimensions – but the tech has to fit somewhere, which probably explains the extra bulk. You don't even get a fingerprint scanner, a feature that Google's included in its latest duo of smartphones after providing dedicated support for the digit-reading tech with Android Marshmallow. It feels a little bit like a missed opportunity. With the Pixel C held in landscape orientation, the power/lock key is located on the left of the top edge, while the volume rocker sits high up on the left, with a USB-C port at the bottom of the same side. The USB-C port enables you to charge the Pixel C and transfer data to and from it, but it also has another use. Connect a phone or Pixel laptop to the Pixel C and the tablet can charge your other devices – handy if your phone is running low and there's no power outlet in sight. There are also dual stereo speakers on either side of the tablet, and a 3.5mm headphone jack completes the array of features on the right side of the Pixel C. On the rear, the 8MP camera is joined by the iconic Chromebook light bar shining in Google's four trademark colours. It's Google's answer to the illuminated Apple logo on the MacBook range, ensuring that even in dark environments people know the brand of your machine. Thank God. It is rather attractive, and it actually serves a purpose other than blowing Google's trumpet. Double-tap the light bar and it can display the Pixel C's battery level, even when the device is turned off – that's really useful if you want to see if it needs a quick charge. The flat edges mean the Pixel C doesn't sit particularly comfortably in the hand, and this isn't a tablet you'll want to be clinging to for extended periods of time. The location of the various buttons, and the orientation of the light bar, signals that Google intends for you to use the Pixel C in landscape mode most of the time. But portrait mode is readily available, and is arguably better for activities such as web browsing. The design then, is pleasing to the eye, but the Pixel C still can't hold a candle to the iPads. Apple's flagship tablets just feel nicer, look slicker and weigh less.  We really like the Pixel C's design, but put it next to the iPad and Apple still wins the beauty contest. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Current page: Introduction and design Next Page Dazzling display, clever keyboard, tasty Marshmallow Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

In a letter, Reliance Jio has asked that the "strongest action" should be taken against the three incumbents, and suggested that the "highest penalty" should be levied against them for what it deems to be gross violation of licence norms, telecom tariff orders, and mobile number portability (MNP) guidelines in an attempt to retain customers wishing to port out of their networks. Reliance Jio had also complained against Airtel advertisements. Airtel's ads had claimed that its network is the fastest in India. Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) had sided with Jio on the matter and asked for the commercials to either be altered or pulled entirely. Following this, Airtel has modified its advertising campaign by removing the word "officially" but it still claims to be the fastest network in India. We're sure that this is not the end of the saga of complaints and accusations between various telcos in India. Here's what else made news in the world of technology today.   Google Areo hyperlocal app launched in India Who knew Google, of all companies, was interested in a slice of the food delivery pie in India? Google has quietly launched the new Areo app on Google Play in India. Apart from letting you order food, Areo allows you to pay bills, call a plumber to fix your sink, or even have a beautician come over to your house. Google has partnered with companies such as Freshmenu and UrbanClap to deliver these services. It's live only in select areas Mumbai and Bengaluru at the moment so if you live in other cities, you'll have to wait to use this app.  Moto C, Moto C Plus, Moto E4, Moto Z2 spotted If leaks are to be believed, a slew of Moto smartphones may be launched soon. Tipster @OnLeaks shared renders of the alleged Moto C, Moto C Plus, Moto E4, and Moto Z2 smartphones. The Moto C and Moto C Plus smartphones seem to be targeted at ultra-affordable segment, and are feature 4G with VoLTE. The Moto E4 is expected to be priced slightly higher than the Moto C range. The Moto Z2 has also been leaked in a render and points that the phone will closely follow its predecessor, the Moto Z.  Xiaomi Mi Max 2 may launch alongside Mi 6; Mi Note 3 rumoured If smartphone launches excite you, then you'll be pleased to know that Xiaomi may be launching two smartphones on April 19. Xiaomi Mi 6 is set to launch at an event in Beijing on April 19, and a fresh report indicates that the company could also launch the Mi Max 2. The device was leaked recently and if you believe the leak, the Mi Max 2 could sport a 6.44-inch display, 6GB of RAM, and a 5000mAh battery. A separate report indicates that the Xiaomi Mi Note 3 could launch sometime in the second quarter of 2017. Leaked specifications claim that the smartphone will have a 5.7-inch display and the latest Snapdragon 835 SoC with 8GB of RAM. It could also offer up to 256GB inbuilt storage. Yes, those specs do sound too good to be true. Samsung Galaxy S8 pre-orders exceed those of Galaxy S7, confirms CEO After the colossal failure of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, the heat was on Samsung to deliver a smash hit with the Galaxy S8. It looks like Samsung may have delivered under pressure. Pre-orders for Samsung's flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone have exceeded those of its predecessor Samsung Galaxy S7, mobile business chief Koh Dong-jin has said. Without actual numbers, there's no telling how successful the S8 really is, but for now, we'll just have to take Samsung's word for it. 'Apple's tax exemption demands rejected' Apple had reportedly asked the Indian government for several concessions in exchange for making iPhones in India. The Finance Ministry has rejected iPhone maker Apple's demand for tax exemptions for setting up a manufacturing unit in India saying that the decision will have to be taken up by the GST Council. These demands were "examined in the Department of Revenue and have not been accepted", the Minister of State for Electronics and IT, P P Chaudhary, said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. said. Facebook Messenger now has 1.2 billion monthly active users, same as WhatsApp Is there any app that's as popular as WhatsApp? The answer appears to be yes. Facebook has announced that it has achieved 1.2 billion monthly active users on its Messenger platform, a 200 million user rise in just 8 months, and the same number that Facebook-owned WhatsApp last reported. There's still some way to go before Facebook Messenger reaches WhatsApp's 200 million active users in India though. Amazon India's digital wallet approved but cash use rises in India New notes were introduced post demonetisation leading to a short-term cash crunch, but was the move enough to make Indians switch to digital payments? The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) said demonetisation helped get 5 crore new customers on digital mediums and over 3 crore have stayed on.  In other news, Amazon India has received an approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to launch its own digital wallet. The move is likely to benefit the e-commerce website in several ways, including doing away with the tedious mandatory two-factor authentication process for online payments on check-out. Apple reportedly hired secret team for treating diabetes Apple's efforts are not just into making gadgets if a fresh report is to be believed. The company has reportedly hired a team of biomedical engineers as part of a secret initiative to develop sensors to treat diabetes, CNBC reported. This was initially envisioned by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the report says. As usual, an Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.

From installing free Wi-Fi spots across major Indian railway stations to launching YouTube Go, a lighter version of the app for offline users or people with low bandwidth, Google is trying to make life convenient and easy for Internet users. The company on Thursday launched an app that will aggregate all hyperlocal services and food delivery apps in the country. Chirstened Aero, the app is available on the Google Play Store for Android users at present. The app, as a pilot, has been launched in Bengaluru and Mumbai. At present, the app features restaurants, chefs, local electricians, plumbers, beauticians and painters among others and people can also pay for the services on the app through all payment modes right from Cash on Delivery to eWallets. One-stop solution From the look of the app, it seems that Google plans to be one-stop solution for all kind of services people search on the Internet. It wants users to search for their requirements on Aero instead of going to different app. This also makes discovery of services and restaurants easy for consumers. However, it is not clear, if Google would want to aggregate e-commerce portals going ahead. Google has, so far, not issued any official statement in this regard. A Google spokesperson for India said that, “We are constantly experimenting with ways to better serve our users in India. In this case, Aero makes everyday chores and ordering food easier by bringing together useful local services like ordering food or hiring a cleaner in one place.” Meanwhile, Google, under Sundar Pichai, has been betting big on the Indian market since the last 2-3 years. The company, which launched its Android One programme in the country in 2015, launched Allo, an instant messenger in India last year. It also launched its Workplace app called Meet that can host HD video meetings for up to 30 people, and allows users to dial into meetings thus taking on Microsoft’s Skype. It also launched its Music Play to take on online streaming sites and also Apple Music. Pichai, in his visit to India early this year, said that India would be a $1-trillion digital economy in the next 3-4 years and it makes business sense for Google to have more India-centric products.

Published on April 13, 2017. Yesterday, Cannes Lions' 2017 Marketer of the Year Burger King pulled off another buzz-making stunt when it released an ad designed to trigger Google Home, prolonging its message well beyond its time on the screen. The simple, 15-second spot from David Miami depicted a Burger King server attempting to describe a Whopper and its fresh ingredients. Since he didn't have a whole lot of time, he ended by asking Google to complete that task. The ad endured not just through the response of the device itself. It also continued to grab the spotlight when Google disabled Home's responsiveness to the spot just hours after its release, generating even more press for Burger King. According to a BK representative, the company had not worked with Google to develop the campaign. But we haven't reached the end just yet. Last night, Burger King ran another version of the ad during "The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon" and "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" -- one that, once again, Google Home responds to. And in case that one stops working, Burger King has also created three more versions, seen below. Try them out now before Google disables them too. In this article: A.I.

Chelsea Stone at Teen VogueApr 13, 2017 12:31PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestGoogle and Getty Images Google is already your first stop for info on, well, anything, but now, the search engine is making a change to become your go-to for style inspiration, too. On Thursday, Google announced the launch of "Style Ideas," a new feature that will provide users searching for fashion-related products with "inspirational lifestyle images and outfits that showcase how the product can be worn in real life." Julia Enthoven, associate product manager at Google, explains in a blog post about the update that "Style Ideas" will allow users to visualize whatever item they're perusing in a street-style context. Sort of like Pinterest, no? Enthoven writes, "With style ideas, you can see real-life options of what bag and jeans look stellar with those red high heels you’ve been eyeing. Or if running gear is more your speed, no sweat—workout ensemble ideas are just a tap away." Another aspect of the new feature: Google will show users items similar to the ones they're searching for, which could be useful for scouting those covetable pieces at a lower price point. According to TechCrunch, the images shown in both "Style Ideas" and as "similar items" are determined by an algorithm, which prioritizes images that are from sources focused on a specific product type, appear as a complete look, and are from authoritative sites. "As an added bonus, you’ll also see an expanded carousel for 'similar items' while searching for apparel products," Google's blog post reads. "That means whether you’re researching shorts and sneakers or checking out sunglasses and handbags, you’ll be able to find product offerings that may suit your tastes." These new features are available in the Google Search app if you have an Android phone, and they can be accessed via Safari and Chrome on any mobile device. Now BRB, off to lose ourselves in a very stylish Google Image Search black hole.

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible. More from this author SEO Bootcamp for Beginners How to Run an SEO Test in 5 Steps Way back when, we published our list of SEO guidelines for developers to help coders lay the groundwork for promoting websites via organic search results. Along with the technical SEO checklist, setting your new website up for SEO success should be pretty straightforward. But what to do when these steps aren’t enough? What do you do when you’ve created your sitemap and robots.txt file, optimized your URLs and meta tags, and set your mobile viewport, but the traffic still isn’t flowing? We’ve put together five quick and easy hacks for developers to give SEO a jump start and get websites into search results. AMP for Mobile Friendliness Much has been made of the importance of mobile search traffic and how to optimize websites for those users. The measure of a website’s mobile optimization is known as mobile friendliness. Mobile friendliness is made up two main ingredients: User experience – How easy is it for users to navigate around a site and complete an action? Is it designed for touchscreens? Speed – A big part of a site’s overall usability, speed is exponentially more important for mobile SEO. Mobile users expect sites to load in just a few seconds. But there’s a way to hack your web site’s mobile friendliness: Accelerated Mobile Pages. Google’s AMP project is a set of specifications designed to create pages for mobile devices that are easily used and navigated, render smoothly and load seemingly instantly. AMP is made of three pieces working together: HTML: Basically normal HTML with custom properties for images, videos and frames; as well as restricted technical functions defined by the open source specs. AMP JavaScript Library: The AMP JS library manages the resource loading for the page, ensuring that any third-party resources don’t block the rendering of the page. Google AMP Cache: A dedicated content delivery network that fetches, stores and serves valid AMP pages and resources from one origin. Using the Accelerated Mobile Pages project specifications is like taking a shortcut to mobile friendliness. The whole project is designed to help make pages mobile friendly: User experience: Since AMP JS loads page elements asynchronously, it ensures that the above-the-fold content appears before anything else. Plus, it requires that aspect rations be predetermined, so the browser knows what the page will look like before it starts rendering. Users are no longer subject to choppy, uneven pages with content that jumps around as it loads. Page speed: There’s a reason AMP as “accelerated” right in the name. According to Google, load times for AMP pages are up to 85% lower than other pages. Search Entity Optimization For the past several years, Google has been incorporating semantic web technology into its search results. These semantic technologies are built on what are known as “entities.” Entities are, as you can likely guess, people, places and things. How will basic nouns help you hack your site’s SEO? Through the beauty of the semantic web and Google’s Knowledge Graph, that’s how. One of the most obvious instances of Google’s semantic search capabilities, the Knowledge Graph is entity search optimization in action. Using structured data markup like JSON-LD, RDF/XML or other RDF formats, you can optimize your brand’s entity to make the most of its entry in the Knowledge Graph. Use a tool like WooRank’s Metadata Tool to point Google to your social media profiles and blog. Just enter your profiles’ URLs into the tool and then copy over the markup to your site. Entity optimization is also vitally important for local businesses, or large businesses with local locations. The semantic web is really important for local businesses so you need to take advantage of its abilities. That means adding optimizing your entities to structure the important data in Google’s local pack results: Use semantic markup like the LocalBusiness schema to add important context to the information about your business: Hours of operation Address Phone number Payments accepted Price range Ratings Don’t be discouraged if you don’t see an immediate boost in traffic to your website. As is often the case with semantic SEO, entity optimization is about getting the most important information in front of users as quickly as possible. Even if they don’t visit your website, we know local SEO improves in-store visits and purchases even without boosting website traffic. Switch to HTTPS Making your site more secure is a really good idea for you and your users, so it’s a really good idea to get an SSL certificate anyways. However, not using HTTPS is also causing your website to lose positions in search results. Switching to HTTPS URLs is a relatively simple and straightforward SEO hack to use on your site. Even if you’ve recently purchased an SSL certificate and migrated to an HTTPS URL, there’s still a chance you’ve got some gaps in security. Even if your domain is hosted on a secure URL, if the page has assets that aren’t Google won’t like that. The first step is to crawl your website to find all of your URLs, both secure and not. You can use a traditional crawler, like Screaming Frog, that will compile a list of each URL and let you find all the non-HTTPS assets. Or, use WooRank’s Site Crawl tool to find each instance of HTTPS pages hosting assets on HTTP URLs. These assets include: Images CSS files Videos Scripts Frames After you’ve fixed your HTTPS pages with HTTP assets, you still have a few more things to check: Robots.txt: Since Google sees HTTP and HTTPS URLs as separate sites, using non-secure URLs in your robots.txt file means your robots.txt file won’t be as effective. Sitemap: Using non-HTTPS URLs in your sitemap could cause Google to crawl and index the unsecure URLs, which is the opposite of what you want. Canonical Tags: Using the wrong URL form for your canonical tag pretty much defeats the purpose of the canonical tag. Once you’ve updated your sitemap and robots.txt file, recrawl your website with Site Crawl. All your canonical tags without HTTPS URLs will show up in the Canonical section as canonical mismatches. Optimize Your Images Image Size Using images and videos on your website is great – it vastly improves your user experience by breaking up text and making content more consumable. You can also use them to improve your website’s SEO. The first SEO hack to look into when optimizing your images is image size. Large images are one of the leading causes of slow page speed and long wait times. And it’s no secret that both humans and Google hate slow pages. When editing your images, scale them down to the smallest file size possible. Many image editors, such as Adobe Photoshop, have a “Save for the Web” option that will automatically minimize file size while maintaining image quality. If you don’t have Photoshop, there are some tools you can use online to help scrub extra stuff like EXIF data: ImageOptim JPEGmini PunyPNG You can also use your browser console or Google’s PageSpeed Insights tools to find unoptimized images slowing your pages down. File Name and Alternative Text The big challenge in using images for SEO has been telling search engines what’s in the image and how it’s relevant to the page. The good news is there are opportunities to optimize your images for keywords: Filename: Filenames are to an image a lot like URLs are to webpages. And they should be optimized in much the same way. Most image hosters will use the image filename when creating its URL, so this will pay off even more. When naming your files, be descriptive and concise and don’t use underscores. Avoid default filenames like “DSC673829.jpg” or “image_01.jpg” unless it’s somehow completely impossible. Alternative text: Alternative text, along with filename, is one of the most important parts of image SEO. It represents the machine-readable "content’ of the image, so it’s your opportunity to include your target keyword. Like filenames, alt text should be concise, but making it too short will negate its benefits. Good image alt text for this image: Would look like: <img src="audit-alt-text-criteria.jpg” alt=”Alt text criteria in the WooRank SEO audit’/> Keep the keywords relevant to the actual image, not necessarily the page. Trying to use alt text like “Alt text in SEO audit as SEO hack for developers” could wind up looking like spammy keyword stuffing. Not good. Wrapping Up Of course, there’s a chance your troubles with Google traffic could go beyond the four hacks listed above. If your traffic is seriously tanking, figure out how to diagnose and treat the problem here. If you’re looking to start growing your audience, conduct an SEO experiment or two to learn what works. However, the four SEO hacks in this article will help you give your website a quick shot in the arm to help get it going.

Choose Blank Activity as the first activity, name it LoginActivity and click Finish. More from this author Integrating the Facebook Graph API in Android Crash Reporting an Android App with Crashlytics and Fabric Setting up gradle Open build.gradle (Module) and add apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services' to the end of the file. Add these lines inside dependencies:     compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:10.2.0'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-identity:10.2.0'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:10.2.0'
 Now open build.gradle (Project) and add this line inside dependencies :     classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0'
 The next step is adding the file google-services.json to your project. This file contains developer credentials and configuration settings to connect to the Google API Client. You can download this file here, move it inside the app folder of your project and Sync gradle. Layouts In the layout folder of your project, delete the content_login.xml file. Inside activity_login.xml, delete the <include layout="@layout/content_login"/> and replace the Floating Action Button code with these lines. The only thing we need in this layout is the Login Button: <RelativeLayout
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:layout_weight="1">

    <com.google.android.gms.common.SignInButton
        android:id="@+id/sign_in_button"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_centerInParent="true"
        android:visibility="visible"
        tools:visibility="gone" />

    <LinearLayout
        android:id="@+id/sign_out_and_disconnect"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_centerInParent="true"
        android:orientation="horizontal"
        android:paddingLeft="16dp"
        android:paddingRight="16dp"
        android:visibility="gone"
        tools:visibility="visible">

        <Button
            android:id="@+id/sign_out_button"
            android:layout_width="0dp"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_weight="1"
            android:text="Sign Out"  />

    </LinearLayout>

</RelativeLayout>
 Open the LoginActivity class and delete the Floating Action Button code inside the onCreate() method. Make sure your public class LoginActivity extends AppCompatActivity and implements GoogleApiClient.OnConnectionFailedListener, View.OnClickListener{ Before the onCreate() method add this code: private static final String TAG = "LoginActivity";
private static final int SIGN_IN_CODE = 9001;
private GoogleApiClient mGoogleApiClient;
private GoogleSignInAccount account;
 Inside the onCreate method, before the closing bracket, add these lines which set-up connections to the Google API and bind them to a sign-in button: findViewById(R.id.sign_in_button).setOnClickListener(this);
        findViewById(R.id.sign_out_button).setOnClickListener(this);

GoogleSignInOptions gso = new GoogleSignInOptions.Builder(GoogleSignInOptions.DEFAULT_SIGN_IN)
                .requestEmail()
                .build();

        mGoogleApiClient = new GoogleApiClient.Builder(this)
                .enableAutoManage(this, this)
                .addApi(Auth.GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_API, gso)
                .build();


        SignInButton signInButton = (SignInButton) findViewById(R.id.sign_in_button);
        signInButton.setSize(SignInButton.SIZE_STANDARD);
 After the onCreate() method we are going to implement overridden methods. The first is onStart() and a placeholder for the onConnectionFailed method. Add them inside the LoginActivity class: @Override
    public void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        OptionalPendingResult<GoogleSignInResult> optPenRes = Auth.GoogleSignInApi.silentSignIn(mGoogleApiClient);
        if (optPenRes.isDone()) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Yayy!");
            GoogleSignInResult result = optPenRes.get();
            handleSignInResult(result);
        } else {
            optPenRes.setResultCallback(new ResultCallback<GoogleSignInResult>() {
                @Override
                public void onResult(GoogleSignInResult googleSignInResult) {
                    handleSignInResult(googleSignInResult);
                }
            });
        }
    }

@Override
public void onConnectionFailed(ConnectionResult connectionResult) {
}
 Do not worry about the errors you will likely see, as we are going to implement these methods later. The second overridden method is onActivityResult(). Add it after the last method added. The code is as follows: @Override
    public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        if (requestCode == SIGN_IN_CODE) {
            GoogleSignInResult result = Auth.GoogleSignInApi.getSignInResultFromIntent(data);
            handleSignInResult(result);
        }
    }}
 Next add the handeSignInResult() method after the onActivityResult() method: private void handleSignInResult(GoogleSignInResult result) {
        Log.e(TAG, "handleSignInResult:" + result.isSuccess());
        if (result.isSuccess()) {
            account = result.getSignInAccount();
            Log.e(TAG,account.getDisplayName());
            Log.e(TAG,account.getEmail());
            Log.e(TAG,account.getId());
            updateUI(true);
        } else {
            updateUI(false);
        }
    }
 Now we will add the signIn() and signOut() methods: private void signIn() {
        Intent signInIntent = Auth.GoogleSignInApi.getSignInIntent(mGoogleApiClient);
        startActivityForResult(signInIntent, SIGN_IN_CODE);
    }

 private void signOut() {
        Auth.GoogleSignInApi.signOut(mGoogleApiClient).setResultCallback(
                new ResultCallback<Status>() {
                    @Override
                    public void onResult(Status status) {
                        updateUI(false);
                    }
                });
    }
 The next method is updateUI(). If the user is signed in, then it changes the visibility of the sign in and sign out buttons, and creates a new Intent called main which represents the next activity opened after we have a successful sign in process. The next activity is MainActivity. Before we switch activities, we should pass some extra data received as account information. We are passing the displayname and imageurl strings to the new intent as extras. private void updateUI(boolean signedIn) {
        if (signedIn) {
            findViewById(R.id.sign_in_button).setVisibility(View.GONE);
            findViewById(R.id.sign_out_and_disconnect).setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
            Intent main = new Intent(this, MainActivity.class);
            main.putExtra("displayname", account.getDisplayName());
            main.putExtra("imageurl", account.getPhotoUrl().toString());
            startActivity(main);
            finish();
        } else {
            findViewById(R.id.sign_in_button).setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
            findViewById(R.id.sign_out_and_disconnect).setVisibility(View.GONE);
        }
    }
 The last method we need to implement in our LoginActivity class is onClick(View v): @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        switch (v.getId()) {
            case R.id.sign_in_button:
                signIn();
                break;
            case R.id.sign_out_button:
                signOut();
                break;
        }
    }
 The LoginActivity class is now complete. Main Activity Class We need another class to display user information and profile picture and to place a Google Plus Share button. Start with creating a new class by right-clicking on your package (e.g: com.example.theodhor.googleplusintegration) and selecting to New -> Activity -> Blank Activity. Leave the default name of MainActivity and click Finish. Delete the content_main.xml file because we don’t need it. Open activity_main.xml and replace <include layout="@layout/content_main"/> with: <LinearLayout
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent"
  android:orientation="vertical"
  android:paddingTop="100dp">

  <TextView
      android:layout_width="wrap_content"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      android:text="Hello"
      android:id="@+id/textView"
      android:layout_gravity="center_horizontal"/>

  <TextView
      android:layout_width="wrap_content"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      android:text="New Text"

 Delete the Floating Action Button code as we won’t use it. Now open the MainActivity class and we’ll add the code to make it work. Firstly make sure the class extends and implements classes we will use: public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements GoogleApiClient.OnConnectionFailedListener, View.OnClickListener {
 Before the onCreate() method add these two lines of code: GoogleApiClient mGoogleApiClient;
private static final int SIGN_IN_CODE = 9001;
 Inside the onCreate() method, replace the Floating Action Button code with these lines: findViewById(R.id.sign_out_button).setOnClickListener(this);

GoogleSignInOptions gso = new GoogleSignInOptions.Builder(GoogleSignInOptions.DEFAULT_SIGN_IN)
  .requestEmail()
  .build();

mGoogleApiClient = new GoogleApiClient.Builder(this)
  .enableAutoManage(this , this)
  .addApi(Auth.GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_API, gso)
  .build();
 Here we created the sign out button and built a new GoogleApiClient that will set which API we’re going to use for our application. In this case we will use Google Authentication since we are performing a Google Plus Login. Inside the same method, add these lines: Intent intent = getIntent();
  String nameSurname = intent.getStringExtra("displayname");
  String imageUrl = intent.getStringExtra("imageurl");
  TextView displayName = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.nameSurnameText);
  displayName.setText("" + nameSurname);
 Here we create an intent and use it to get the extras sent form the last activity, the of displayname and imageurl strings. Next we should add the code that creates the share button: Button shareButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.share_button);
shareButton.setOnClickListener(this);
 Since View.OnClickListener is implemented in this class, we need the overridden method for it. Add it after the onCreate() method: @Override
public void onClick(View v) {
  switch (v.getId()) {
      case R.id.sign_in_button:
          signIn();
          break;
      case R.id.sign_out_button:
          signOut();
          break;
      case R.id.share_button:
          Intent shareIntent = new PlusShare.Builder(this)
                  .setType("text/plain")
                  .getIntent();
          startActivityForResult(shareIntent, 0);
          break;
  }
}
 The remaining methods for this class are signIn() , signOut() and an overridden method called onConnectionFailed() : @Override
public void onConnectionFailed(ConnectionResult connectionResult) {
}

private void signOut() {
  Auth.GoogleSignInApi.signOut(mGoogleApiClient).setResultCallback(
          new ResultCallback<Status>() {
              @Override
              public void onResult(Status status) {
                  Intent login = new Intent(MainActivity.this, LoginActivity.class);
                  startActivity(login);
                  finish();
              }
          });
}

private void signIn() {
  Intent signInIntent = Auth.GoogleSignInApi.getSignInIntent(mGoogleApiClient);
  startActivityForResult(signInIntent, SIGN_IN_CODE);
}
 From LoginActivity we receive the displayname and imageurl as strings. The first will be displayed as text using a TextView but the seconds needs to be displayed as an image. Let’s create another class that uses our imageurl string to download and show a bitmap image. Create a new class by right-clicking your package and selecting New -> Java Class. I called it DownloadImageTask and it’s code is below: public class DownloadImageTask extends AsyncTask<String, Void, Bitmap> {
  ImageView bmImage;

  public DownloadImageTask(ImageView mImage) {
      this.bmImage = mImage;
  }

  protected Bitmap doInBackground(String... urls) {
      String url = urls[0];
      Bitmap mBitmap = null;
      try {
          InputStream in = new java.net.URL(url).openStream();
          mBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(in);
      } catch (Exception e) {
          Log.e("Error", e.getMessage());
          e.printStackTrace();
      }
      return mBitmap;
  }

  protected void onPostExecute(Bitmap result) {
      bmImage.setImageBitmap(result);
  }
}
 To call it in our MainActivity class add this line of code inside the onCreate() method: new DownloadImageTask((ImageView) findViewById(R.id.imageView)).execute(imageUrl);
 Enabling Google Play Services The last task is connecting our application to Google APIs. Click here to browse the Google Services Page. Add your application name and package name and click Continue. On the next view add your SHA-1 fingerprint key. If you don’t know how to do this, Google’s help pages are the best source of information. Click Continue to generate the configuration files we need, download the google-services.json file and move it inside your YourProjectName/app/ or mobile/ directory. Now you can run the application. Conclusion In this tutorial I showed some basic steps to integrate Google Plus into an Android application for authentication and sharing content. There is much more that can be accomplished with this integration such as social graph information, deep linking and over air installs. I’d love to hear any questions, issues and ideas you may have.

Theodhor Pandeli Hi Jackson, I just reviewed the code and it is okay, but can you tell me, does it crash or gives errors in Error Log? Jackson Welch it just doesn’t sign in. it prompts me with the prompt to sign in however after that it just goes away. when I hit it again the screen gets darker for about two seconds, then nothing. I have created a .JSON file and it is in my project. Alice John I am getting the error that PlusShare cannot be resolved…Plz Help Theodhor Pandeli Hi Alice, are your imports all right? Please check if you have imported the following inside the MainActivity: import com.google.android.gms.plus.PlusShare; import com.google.android.gms.plus.PlusShare.Builder; import com.google.android.gms.plus.internal.model.people.PersonEntity; Please tell me if you still have problems :) Pooja Mehta Hi! This code works fine for me when I am running the application directly from Android Studio in developer mode but since I need to integrate Google Sign-In for my final year project which I need to upload on the play store, the signed apk doesn’t let me sign-in into my account. The isSuccess() method of GoogleSignInResult instance returns false and hence I am not able to log in to my application. Please guide me in whichever way you can! Thanks! Theodhor Pandeli Hello, since it returns false I think the code is okay, just make sure that you are using the right API keys. The key hash you used before is for the debug type of the app. So to generate the Key Hash you need, you should use the release key. Hope it works! Pooja Mehta Hello, I have even tried this solution before but unfortunately the signed apk still doesn’t work. It still returns false. Theodhor Pandeli It seems hard to tell what is the problem. Does it show any error in the log? And something else, is the “google-services.json” file inside the project? Pooja Mehta Hello, I am already kept the google-services.json file inside the project and I am not getting any errors as such specifically but I just cant log into the account. This problem is only happening for lollipop and marshmallow devices. I surfed a lot for this issue but I am not able to get any solution for it. Thanks! Daenys PiedradelValle Hi, I’m getting the same scene. I download the project from GitHub and run it on my device.

That includes, building a minimum viable product, market validation and conversion rate optimization. But for many of you, the biggest hurdle to overcome precedes validating your MVP or optimizing your conversion rate. That hurdle is: Finding a niche. In this article, Alex Moskovski — a maker and monetizer of software — will tackle that very problem and give us the rundown on finding the right niche, validating your MVP and getting your early-stage pricing right with a dynamic testing model. Side note: Enjoying the articles so far? Tell me what you’re struggling with in your own projects via email or Twitter. I recently wrote an article about my little SaaS experiment in the Russian market that brought me a steady $1,000 in monthly revenue, Menumake. That article went viral. Many people asked a lot of questions about the details of the building process and what they needed to do to replicate that success. Here’s a detailed follow-up on the most interesting and complicated parts, plus some tricks on how to find a niche and validate early stage pricing. Table of contents: find your niche with 3 simple tactics bootstrapping a lean MVP ship quickly with this tech stack nail early stage pricing with 2 simple tactics Three Simple Tactics To Find a Niche How do you find your next idea and validate demand? After all, you don’t want to waste time building an MVP that nobody wants. The first and the most obvious way is to have some stats that identify a pain point. Tactic 1: Data that leads to a pain point In the SaaS example from my first article, I used Google Analytics data on keywords people used to find my other startup, Postio. I built Postio to make it easier for people to find and publish content to their social accounts and groups. As a part of its marketing strategy, I bought and published a dozen articles on various subjects targeted at the web services audience to get some extra traffic. All of a sudden, Postio started to get a large amount of traffic from Google and Yandex (a Russian search engine) with keywords that have nothing to do with Postio itself. The keyword data looked like this: Clearly, people were having real issues with this menu thing. I had two options: build it in the existing project start a spin-off I chose the latter, because it would be easier to implement SEO strategy and branding later on. Also, the concept of menu generation is entirely different than the concept of post publishing, which Postio had been built on. Back to discovering ideas. Tactic 2: Paving You can follow the method below, even if you don’t have any existing projects or stats. I call it paving. All you have to do is to go to any niche forum and start analyzing what people are doing there and which problems they’re trying to solve using the community. For example, since we’re on SitePoint now, let’s consider their sister site, Flippa. Most webmaster forums follow a common trend: they all have a marketplace section. This method of buying and selling online is highly inconvenient and risky. This path was just asking to be paved. And Flippa has done it, elegantly and efficiently, by creating a spin-off centered around making website and domain transactions seamless. I also observed this trend in the Russian market, and I’m sure people from other local markets can tell the same story. Just go to niche communities, listen to people, and every time you see an issue, ask yourself: How can I optimize it using the technology I wield? It’s incredibly valuable to encourage this attitude as a mental process. I know it’s hard to do, because, since school, we’ve been taught to solve problems, not to find them. You aren’t always going to be given problems to solve. Reverse engineering the process is a valuable skill to have in the workplace and in your personal projects. Tactic 3: My niche-specific insight tool Okay, the third method. It’s quite chaotic, but I often use it to reignite my brain and to set it to the right mood. I wrote a simple script that generates a table of entities and corresponding verbs to facilitate discovering new connections. Here’s an example: Remember, you need to fine-tune this script to match the niche you’re trying to get insights into. And it doesn’t need to be verbs and entities; you can try anything. The point is to get as many relevant intersections as you can. Here’s the code I used for the example: <?
$entities = array('image', 'photo', 'text', 'source', 'site', 'traffic', 'money', 'book', 'e-book', 'file', 'smartphone', 'camera', 'notebook', 'cities', 'distances', 'cars', 'mobile', 'book', 'sex', 'love', 'classifieds', 'ads', 'alcohol', 'travel');
$verbs = array('sell', 'buy', 'rent', 'exchange', 'free', 'give', 'book', 'clean', 'find', 'classify', 'compare');

echo '<table style="width: 100%">';

foreach ($entities as $entity)
{
    echo '<tr>';
    foreach ($verbs as $verb)
        echo "<td style='font-size: 14px; padding: 5px; text-align: center'>$verb $entity</td>";
    echo '</tr>';
}

echo '</table>';
?>
 There are plenty more tricks for finding a good idea, but let’s not become laser-focused on them now, as we need to move to the next step of bootstrapping a startup. Building a Lean MVP and Validating It When I was building the MVP for Menumake, I tried to get rid of everything that could be added later on. Here’s the menu creation interface of the MVP as compared to the one that Menumake has now, for one: Most of the time, people that ask me what they should put in an MVP tend to overestimate the importance of some features. Consider pruning the following: Authentication. Do your users really need to have an individual identity to solve their problem? Dedicated support interface. Having just an email somewhere in the footer may suffice in the earlier stages. Payment gateway. You can collect payments manually. Stripe can wait. Sophisticated design. This can be done later, after the validation. To start with, Bootstrap will do this job just fine. Robust infrastructure. Now, this can be tricky. I’m not saying you should write unreadable code, but maybe scalability issues can be addressed later. Sure, if you can assemble a scalable infrastructure fast, there’s no point using a shady stack. The rest of us shouldn’t spend much time obsessing over pleasurable issues of exponential growth at this point. What’s Your Tech Stack? I use a simple LAMP stack with Codeigniter and jQuery mixed in for all my web services. When the task is demanding, I consider Go. That’s just about it. I go with what I’m most comfortable with, and what allows me to ship fast. That’s what makes the difference at the end of the day. Users can’t see your stack anyway. Consider the web app in question: what would be the most important features we couldn’t omit? Let’s even go a bit further and ask a bolder question: what do our prospective users expect to get from us, and why are they here? It’s not for a signup form, support, and a neat design. Even the menu creation interface doesn’t interest them yet. They want a menu. In their group. Right now. This is the solution we should strive to achieve, removing any obstacles that could be in the user’s way. All we need is a simple generator and instructions on how to install a menu. Yes, I know, I didn’t follow my own advice with Menumake’s MVP and built in some extra features like authentication and a bit of user account UI. I could afford that because this is not my first project in the niche, so I had a lot of templates and could set everything up fast. Back to the menu generator. Again, I hadn’t used anything fancy, just good old ImageMagick with simple math sorcery. After building the whole menu image, it was cut into pieces, and offered for download with brief instructions on how to put it in the group. This simple process brought me around $50, validating the idea. Let me stress something one more time: I never considered myself a professional developer. I’m lousy when it comes to sophisticated stuff like modern approaches in software engineering. So I have to cut corners. If you are comfortable with building scalable infrastructure from the day one, you have an edge on the people like me. Just don’t obsess over it at this point. Most of the time it has nothing to do with getting your baby startup off the ground. Pricing Your MVP Pricing is hard. What’s worse, there isn’t much space for guesstimating here, since even the smallest mistake can easily cost you money in the long run. We need to stop thinking of pricing as an art form, but rather adapt a more data-driven approach. Usually, I resolve this issue in two steps: estimating and fine-tuning. Step 1: Estimating First, we need to look around and try to get an idea of the average price in the niche. If your SaaS is in a well-established market, you can use catalogs like Capterra or GetApp to get an idea on the distribution of prices. You can collect raw data from the competitors yourself, but I suggest outsourcing it to someone. After all, that’s not the most exciting thing to do. After collecting the data, I visualize it on a chart. Most of the time, it’s a bell-shaped curve. If it’s not, or there’s more than one bell (like on the screenshot below), chances are you’ve taken your data from several niches instead of one, and you need to eliminate the sources that don’t belong to your segment of the market. All we need from our chart are two prices, the one at the beginning of the bell and the one at its end. These are the minimum and maximum price points. Usually, there’s no point going beyond this scope, but each case is different, and there are a lot of variables that you need to take into account when deciding whether to test the outlying prices or not. Usually I postpone analyzing these prices until I have some real stats after the fine-tuning mentioned in Step 2 below. Sometimes it’s impossible to estimate the price range because the market doesn’t exist yet. That was the case with Menumake. So we have to find another way to figure out the maximum price users are willing to pay for our product. Again, there’s no silver bullet here, but for Menumake I estimated the maximum price by observing how much professional designers were charging for this job. (I figure they have much more modest expectations now.) Step 2: Fine-Tuning It’s time to fine-tune our price estimation. As much as we like to think we understand the pricing in our niche now, we don’t. The only way to actually figure out the most profitable prices is to test every single one of them. In Menumake, I did this by assigning a random price — from the scope I’d estimated during Step 1 — to each user after the signup. Sorry, no fancy AI algorithms this time: Please note, I was testing two prices at the same time — for creating a menu, and for updating it. But what if the users become aware of our unfair split-testing we perform on them? Just tell them the truth. Tell them that you’re trying to estimate the real value of your product. Offer them a discount if they’re still unhappy about the price but are willing to negotiate. Personally, I couldn’t believe how laid back my customers were about pricing. Sure, I had a couple of angry customers here and there, but there weren’t any issues that couldn’t be settled by offering a solid discount. Make sure your testing period is long enough. Remember, the sooner you find out the most effective price, the more you earn in the long term. Oh, and don’t forget to re-adjust the prices for users that have been affected by an unfairly large price tag. A small discount would work. To give you an idea of what you should have at the end of the test period, take a look at the data I collected for Menumake: What do these stats tell us? Pretty interesting stuff: $1, $2, and $3 for menu creation and $0.50 for updating it are the most profitable prices. $1 has twice as many menu creations as $2 and three times as many as $3. The $1/$0.50 combination is the most profitable in terms of ARPU. Even though the $2 price appeared to be much less hassle for the same revenue, I decided to stick with $1. I wanted users to create as many menus as they wanted, as every menu had a little viral mechanism. Yes, these conclusions are still imperfect, and there’s a lot of room for improvement. But at least we’re a bit closer to the reality now. I hope both this article and my previous one have clarified some points on building a simple SaaS web app — despite there still being a lot of things I’d like to mention.

Image Credit: Google Google today is talking for the first time about research that two of its scientists have conducted in the area of making computers generate simple sketches using artificial intelligence (AI). The emphasis is on creation instead of analysis, putting it in line with the meme-friendly DeepDream technology and more recently the art and music generation efforts coming out of Google’s Project Magenta. Google trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) on sketches that real people made. They’ve come from Quick, Draw!, an experimental app that directs you to make drawings of simple things like an axe or a snail and then tries to guess what you’ve made. “We have selected 75 classes from the raw dataset to construct the quickdraw-75 dataset. Each class consists of a training set of 70K samples, in addition to 2.5K samples each for validation and test sets,” David Ha and Douglas Eck of Google Research wrote in a new paper titled “A Neural Representation of Sketch Drawings.” The researchers added noise into their system to ensure that it doesn’t simply copy the real sketches. Other researchers have previously developed approaches for having software imitate the contents of photos, but making vector images with neural networks is not so common, Ha and Eck wrote. That said, there have been some attempts to generate Chinese characters in vector format with neural networks. Ha himself has previously done experiments in this area. Above: Sketches of gardens and owls. Image Credit: Paper screenshot Key in the new work is examining what people do when they sketch, which isn’t necessarily top of mind for fully developed adults: “which direction to move, when to lift the pen up, and when to stop drawing,” Ha wrote in a blog post. While they might not immediately lead to gains in core Google apps and services, the resulting computer sketches are fascinating to look at, and one could imagine them popping up on tote bags or smartphone wallpapers. And the underlying model could help artists produce work, and even help people learn to draw, Ha wrote. An open source version of the model is coming, and a set of human drawings could also become publicly available, Ha and Eck wrote in the paper.

Once the coolest and most convenient way to explore the planet on a computer, the app has been largely cannibalized as Maps became ever more powerful. But Google hasn’t forgotten about it, and just sent out invites to the press for an event where it will unveil “the new Google Earth”. It will be held on April 18, just four days before Earth Day on the 22nd As for what this new experience will look like, Google isn’t providing any hints. Still, I’m guessing it will be a major redesign of the software given Google is devoting a whole event to it. Earth has traditionally been the more powerful alternative to Google Maps, allowing you to do things like use a flight simulator or view the effects of global warming over time, so expect some cool new features to give you a reason to download it over Maps. I wouldn’t be surprised to see additional VR news too, following Google Earth VR‘s announcement in November.

And Failed Pretty Quickly By Colin Dwyer • 14 hours ago TweetShareGoogle+Email Real quick, here's a list of ingredients you're unlikely to find in your next Burger King Whopper: Chocolate candy Toenail clippings Cyanide Rat Medium-sized child Yet for a while Wednesday, those are precisely the ingredients — according to Business Insider and The Verge, at least — that the fast-food chain's new commercial accidentally directed viewers to check out. The pitchman in Burger King's brief advertisement played off that brevity by noting he just didn't have enough time to list all "the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich" — so instead, he simply pulled the camera near and closed with a question addressed to the viewers' home devices: "OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?" The idea was that if the search company's smart speaker (and possibly future sentient overlord) Google Home happened to be listening nearby, it would then answer the question with a makeshift promo for the burger — an explanation of Burger King's signature item. And there is video proof the stunt indeed worked like a charm ... ... for a little while, that is. You see, two problems cropped up pretty quickly. First off, Business Insider notes the ad sent Google Homes directly to Wikipedia, which — as high school syllabuses across the country will warn you — is not always a reliable source of accurate information. Enterprising trolls all but immediately took to the Whopper page to make some rather clever (if dubious) edits. Hence the toenail clippings. Also, according to Gizmodo, this short-lived description: "The 'Whopper' is the worst hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King." And this one (emphasis ours): "The Whopper is a burger, consisting of a flame-grilled patty made with 100% medium-sized child with no preservatives or fillers, topped with sliced tomatoes, onions, lettuce, pickles, ketchup, and mayonnaise, served on a sesame-seed bun." Soon the company caught wind of the mischief and locked the page with a neutral definition, Gizmodo says. Then there was another problem: The New York Times reports that Burger King didn't consult Google on the campaign ahead of time. Within hours, the tech company put a stop to the central shtick of the ad, changing its device so that Burger King's question — as it is uttered in the commercial — would no longer wake it. The Financial Times explains how the company likely made the tweak: "What we have learnt about Google Home, at least, is that the internet group does know how to switch off a particular voice trigger when it wants to, probably by checking an audio 'fingerprint' against a blacklist in the cloud before allowing a response." This may pose further problems for the commercial, which Business Insider says is running on at least a half-dozen channels in several major cities. At any rate, the commercial's ploy and its deactivation nabbed Burger King some attention and served as a reminder for us all: It might be that eventually the real achievement isn't the fact our devices talk to one another — as they briefly did in this case — but rather that we can still get them to shut up at all.

If you currently use Hangouts as your default SMS app, that means you also need a Hangouts replacement. But the best replacement app depends on your needs. Why People Used Hangouts For a while, Hangouts seemed poised to be the iMessage of Android. Hangouts came as the default SMS app on some devices, and others voluntarily made it their texting app. Unfortunately, it just never caught on. Now, with Hangouts moving towards the corporate scene and away from the consumer side of things, Google has decided to remove the SMS integration. That means no more sending or receiving texts (from your carrier-supplied number) using the Hangouts app. If you connected Hangouts with Google Voice and use that integration to get free outgoing and incoming SMS messages from your Voice number, you’re in luck. That feature isn’t being killed… yet. But with the revitalization of the Google Voice app Google Voice Gets an Update and Is More Useful Than Ever Google Voice Gets an Update and Is More Useful Than Ever Google Voice, long thought abandoned, was just revived by Google. Here's what's up with Voice and what you can expect to see in the revamped apps. Read More , its death might be on the horizon, so why not jump ship early? For one reason or another, it’s probably best for most folks currently using Hangouts to make to other apps. Backing Up Hangouts Data Before you start using another service, you should back up your Hangouts data. Hangouts isn’t getting killed off, but you may want to backup your data anyway if you’re planning to leave the service behind. Thankfully, it’s dead-simple. If you use Hangouts for SMS, this has to be done in two parts. Part 1: Hangouts-to-Hangouts Messages Simply navigate to Google Takeout (preferably on a desktop/laptop). Deselect all of the services that you don’t want to back up. Then choose Done from the bottom left of the screen. On the next screen, the defaults should work for almost anyone. Choose Create archive to backup your data. If you use Hangouts for SMS messaging, this will only save your Hangouts-to-Hangouts message, but not your SMS messages. Google stores Hangouts chats as JSON data. On the downside, I am not aware of any chat app that can currently important this data. Part 2: SMS Messages To back up all of your SMS messages, we recommend using SMS Backup & Restore How to Delete, Back Up, and Recover SMS Text Messages on Android How to Delete, Back Up, and Recover SMS Text Messages on Android If you need to delete, backup, or restore text messages on Android, this article has you covered. Read More . If you’ve been using Hangouts as your default SMS app, this will save all your SMS messages, but none of your Hangouts-to-Hangouts messages. You can then restore your SMS messages to whichever app you decide to migrate over to. Website — Google Takeout Download — SMS Backup & Restore If You Need an SMS Replacement App If you used Hangouts as an SMS app, you can replace that function with the stock Android SMS app: Android Messages. Android Messages offers a drop-in replacement for Hangouts. For most newer devices, the app comes pre-installed. On older Android devices, you can simply install it from the Play Store. However, if the stock app isn’t what you crave, Facebook Messenger offers a compelling alternative. Not only does it centralize your SMS conversations, it also aggregates Facebook chats. There are also a ton of other replacement SMS options Text Better with These Alternative SMS Apps for Android Text Better with These Alternative SMS Apps for Android Don't like your default SMS app? Try a new one! Read More for you in the Play Store, ranging from the simple to the feature-packed. Download — Android Messages (Free) Download — Facebook Messenger (Free) If You Want Free Wi-Fi Calls and Texts If you used Hangouts integration with Google Voice, you got free SMS messages and phone calls from your Voice number. If you can see the writing on the wall for Voice integration in Hangouts, you can just go ahead and download the new updated Voice app. This will allow you to text and check your voicemails from the Voice app, but unfortunately, Voice still doesn’t have a built-in dialer. On Android, that means that Voice uses your default dialer app — but on the desktop, that means that you still need to make and receive calls through Hangouts. Hopefully they’ll give Voice its own calling feature independent of Hangouts soon, but for now, users are kind of forced to be split between the two apps. If you’re fine just waiting until Google officially kills Voice integration with Hangouts, though, you can just leave it integrated and continue as normal. Or, if you find Google’s fragmented messaging strategy too irritating to deal with, try Talkatone. Not only does it handle calls and SMS for numbers based in the United States, it also comes with a free phone number — provided that you register the app. Another service, GrooVe IP, offers most of the same excellent services and features as Talkatone. The difference is in their pricing structures. While both offer ad-supported free versions, Talkatone’s in-app pricing runs for $1.99 per month. GrooVe IP charges a one-time fee of $6.99 for the pro version. If neither of those work for you, try one of these alternatives for getting a free U.S. phone number No US Phone Number?

Download — Google Voice (Free) Download — Talkatone (Free) Download — GrooVe IP (Free) Temporary Phone Apps If you want an anonymous alternative to Hangouts, considering trying a temporary phone app. These apps provide a temporary phone number along with SMS and calling capabilities. You also get the benefit of concealing your identity. Most people use temporary phone apps for conducting Craigslist or eBay transactions. For those interested, we’ve covered anonymous messaging apps 5 Apps for Getting a Temporary Burner Phone Number 5 Apps for Getting a Temporary Burner Phone Number If you need a temporary or second phone number, you should download one of these burner apps.

Sometimes, you just need a basic phone to keep around for emergencies. Let's look at why. Read More . The text messages and calls don’t cost much, and they consume data rather than your phone’s minutes or SMS allotment. There are two main options you might want to try. Burner Burner (its name derives from “burner phone Sick of the NSA Tracking You? Burn Them with a Burner Phone Sick of the NSA Tracking You?

Hushed Like Burner, Hushed can create anonymous and temporary phone numbers. It also includes a texting plan. Hushed offers several tiers of prices and services. But you can try the service out for free. I personally prefer Hushed — but the Burner app is just as good. Download — Hushed (Free) Download — Burner (Free) Get All Your Messages in One Place For those of you who use Facebook Messenger, SMS, and Whatsapp, you’re in luck. You can get all your conversations dumped into a single app: Disa. Disa’s developers intend to plug additional chat services into their app later. Unfortunately, you still pay for SMS. Had it included interoperability with a VoIP app, such as GrooVe IP or Talkatone, it could entirely replace Hangouts (in fact, it’d be better than Hangouts). But for now, it’s just a flexible cross-platform instant messaging service. Hopefully sometime in the future, Disa might offer a plugin for a VoIP client, and that would make it the ultimate chat app. Download — Disa (Free) What’s the Best Hangouts Replacement? Right now, no perfect Hangouts replacement exists. Fortunately, if you’re done with Hangouts, most of its features can be found in other apps. If you need a new SMS messaging client, try Android Messages. If free SMS capabilities are your thing, try out Talkatone. And for those who need a temporary number, try Hushed.

A video from a Burger King marketing agency showed the plan in action: “You’re watching a 15-second Burger King ad, which is unfortunately not enough time to explain all the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich,” the actor in the commercial said. “But I got an idea. OK, Google, what is the Whopper burger?” Prompted by the phrase “OK, Google,” the Google Home device beside the TV in the video lit up, searched the phrase on Wikipedia and stated the ingredients. However, within hours of the ad’s release — and humorous edits to the Whopper Wikipedia page by mischievous users — tests from The Verge and BuzzFeed showed that the commercial had stopped activating the device. Burger King said Google appeared to make changes by Wednesday afternoon that stopped the commercial from waking the devices. Google, which previously said it had not been consulted on the campaign, did not respond to requests for comment. It was unclear whether Burger King could alter some of the ads, which were to air on Wednesday during “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and other shows, to work around any changes. “With the onset of consumers buying intelligent system devices and using them at home, we thought this was a good way to make a connection and go directly to guests and tell a story about our product,” Burger King president Jose Cil said in an interview on Wednesday morning.

Billed as “an experimental new podium on Google”, Google Posts has attracted a lot of attention from marketers, search specialists and Google enthusiasts thanks to its prominent place on the SERP – appearing in the form of an eye-catching carousel of cards – and its mysterious deployment. Over the year since it was first released, it has appeared in and disappeared from search results a number of times with no apparent pattern or explanation. Brands who wanted a shot at being part of Google’s new podium were forced to “Join the waitlist” and cross their fingers. But last month Google suddenly announced that it would be opening up Posts to “museums, sports teams, sports leagues, and movies” in the United States, and all of the above groups along with musicians in Brazil – prompting a renewed flurry of interest from marketers. At the same time, the relaunched Posts became more visually eye-catching with the addition of embedded GIFs and videos.   One person, however, doesn’t believe that Google Posts is worth the hype. Michael Bertini, Online Marketing Consultant and Search Strategist at iQuanti, told Search Engine Watch why he thinks that Google has gone off half-cocked with Posts, and why marketers would be better off expending their energies elsewhere. Google Posts: where is the value? “I don’t think Google will admit that they made a mistake with this whole Posts thing,” says Bertini. “Google already has a lot of great products and search results features on the page; to add Google Posts to that clutters up the results page unnecessarily. And I don’t think it offers much value to the end user.” It’s true that while there has been a lot of excitement from brands and marketers around the prospect of publishing directly to the SERP, few of us have considered its usefulness to users. Google is still first and foremost a search engine; when users enter a search query, they are presumably looking for information. While people Googling candidates in the run-up to the US Presidential Election would undoubtedly have been interested in what those candidates had to say about certain issues, subsequent versions of Google Posts have moved further and further away from a feature that is useful to the end user. Few people searching for “Boston Red Sox” are looking for pseudo-social updates from their favorite sports team; they’re more likely to be looking for match scores, game tickets, or perhaps a link to the team’s website. A lot of the interest around Google Posts thus far has been driven by sheer novelty, with people Googling ‘Andrews Jewelers’ or ‘Escape Pod Comics’ simply to see how the businesses had been using Posts – rather than because they featured useful information. In and of itself, how much value does Posts provide to the searcher? “I don’t think anybody should put a strict focus on getting into Posts – or any one Google feature,” says Bertini. “What I’ve noticed throughout my career is that people who make it a specific focus to get into an area of Google – let’s use Google’s Answer Box as an example – ultimately, they’re left with content that doesn’t fit the end user’s needs. And then it dies.” “If someone did want to get involved with Google Posts, they should write content that really answers the search query, and then of course request access on posts.withgoogle.com. But that’s all.” Everything is a test Based on the fact that Posts has already come and gone from the SERP several times before this most recent, wider launch, does Bertini think that Posts is finally here to stay? “Everything Google is about testing,” Bertini replies. “Even after they launch it to market, what they would consider ‘permanent’ is not really what we would consider permanent. Personally, I think it’ll last up until the third quarter of 2017, and then they’ll mix it up with something else. “If Posts get a really high CTR, then Google might invest more in it and add more features. But at the moment, it’s still very much in testing. It still lacks features – there’s no real social interaction, for example.” Google Posts currently allows for limited social sharing, but doesn’t provide a way for users to truly interact with or respond to Posts. If Posts, ultimately, is still in testing, it explains why it has disappeared and reappeared with so little fanfare – Google doesn’t want to attract a lot of attention to a feature that may not even be launched on a wider scale. Bertini agrees that the lack of promotion speaks volumes about Google’s intentions – or lack thereof – for the feature. “If Google had complete confidence in this feature, they would be promoting it more.” He goes on: “If I ran my own business, and I wanted to get more searchers to my site, there are better ways to do that than to focus on GIFs and videos to get into Google Posts. “For example, if I were making videos already, I would create pages for my videos, transcribe that content, and optimize it for search – that would be a better use of resources than focusing on getting into Posts. “Ultimately, people are going to invest time and effort into Posts, when Google itself has not yet perfected this feature.” Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin18 Google+2 Twitter 20 Related articles How can marketers optimize for Google's new "similar items" feature? Google launches Fact Check in search results worldwide Five most interesting search marketing news stories of the week “Ubiquitous and seamless”: The future of voice search Google Plus revisited? Given the pseudo-social nature of Google Posts, a lot of comparisons have understandably been drawn between Google Posts and Google Plus, Google’s last ill-fated venture into social networking. And it could be that Google Plus provides a blueprint for what to expect from the future of Google Posts. “If we look back at Google Plus – when it first launched, Google’s idea of what Plus would be is not what it is today. And like everything Google, Google will never admit that they made a mistake, or that the product didn’t turn out the way they wanted it to be. “But I think the search marketers who used Google Plus as a social platform are very disappointed today – if they invested a lot of time and money into building up their profiles and optimizing their Google Plus. It’s not used the way it used to be used, any more. I think it’s going to be the same with Google Posts.” Remember when Google Plus was a big deal? Bertini believes the aim of introducing Google Posts to the SERP is to encourage more user interaction with the search engine results page. This would tie in with the recent addition of rich results for podcasts to the SERP, allowing searchers on smartphones and Google Home to play podcasts directly from the search page. “Google is trying to make a different version of social [with Posts], which is social interaction with the search engine results page, where a user can interact with the search page itself. It’s just very early on at the moment.” If Google can succeed in expanding the function of the search results page in this way, it would definitely be a means of keeping users inside its own walled garden for longer. But without value to the end user, Google Posts could be a Plus-style flop, and Bertini thinks that Google would be better off focusing its attention on perfecting existing features of the SERP that have more value to searchers. “Google is constantly trying to mix things up, when – once again, personal belief – I think that they should focus on good products that they’ve launched like Answer Box, which is already effective. Or ‘People Also Ask’ – they launched this section, and it’s still not perfect, but it’s good. “I think this is what Google should devote its energy to, rather than – I don’t want to say get rid of Facebook or Twitter, because I don’t think that will happen – but rather than trying to make the search results page a social platform.” The future of Google Posts Google Posts, as it stands, still lacks a lot of functionality. So an ideal world, what would a fully-featured Google Posts look like? “One, people search for something; two, a Post feature comes up; three, there would be a rating system for whether or not the Post matches the search query. “Then there would be a sharing function where the user can share the Post via social media. You could also have a Hangouts-style feature integrating chat into Posts, allowing people to chat about what they’ve just read.” It remains to be seen whether Google will try to keep integrating more functionality into Posts or whether it will once again disappear quietly from the SERP. But one way or the other, marketers should keep sight of the importance of catering to the end user – not just to the newest Google feature.

[Update: Google resolves endless OTA loop] Google is updating Nexus 6P beta testers to the final 7.1.2 build [OTA Download] Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/12 6:00pm PDTApr 12, 2017 61 Plus 1 on G+ 120 Share on Facebook 95 Share on Twitter Total Shares276 Device Updates Downloads Google News Nexus 6P Nexus Devices Nougat 7.0/7.1 Update 1: 2017/04/12 6:04pm PDT Issues with beta OTAs Google's Android beta program allows the more intrepid among you to take a first crack at new updates, but it can be a little irksome to then move to the final build. For example, the 7.1.2 testers are still running the beta while the final version has rolled out to non-testers. Now, it looks like Google has started updating the beta build to final, but only for the Nexus 6P so far. The update clocks in at a mere 25.4MB, which isn't surprising. You're only going from 7.1.2 to a slightly different 7.1.2. The build number when all's said and done will be N2G47H. That's the same build that rolled out to non-testers. There should not be any feature differences between the two versions, but being on the right build means you'll be able to get OTA updates going forward. We don't yet know if this is rolling out to everyone, but check your update menu to be safe. If it's not there, we've got the URL of the OTA on Google's servers. Feel free to sideload it if you can't wait, but remember this is only for the 6P. Hopefully other devices on the beta get updates soon. Update 1: 2017/04/12 6:04pm PDT Issues with beta OTAs We got numerous reports earlier than phones were being offered another update to the beta build after installing the final one. Google neglected to flip some switch on its end to prevent phones from getting the beta OTA again, but that should be fixed now.

Xious That's the same beta build that is on my Pixel. wjrandon Beta for life. x8123999 Pixel C just got it, too. Build N2G47D. Brian Langlois I got this update. then promptly got the notification that the system update NPG47I was available. Installed that. Then promptly got the notification that This update (N2G47H) was available. It just keeps prompting to update inthenickoftime4 Same MichaelFranz same, but i didnt install the NPG47I. victor sanchez same here. Серёжа Дураков same Jean-Pierre Tavan Same... VAL Same here, weird Brianna D Green Mine did this as well but once your on the (N2G47H), just reset the phone and then go into the update screen in settings and the (NPG47I) update notification disappears. At least it did for me. Lol. James Brown What do you mean by "reset the phone." I have rebooted and gone into settings/system updates but I still get the prompt to download the previous version. Brianna D Green I rebooted after the new update and then once back in the phone, went to the update screen and notification disappeared after hitting check for update. James Brown Didn't work for me. Minty Yeah I think it's happening to everyone. I just let it put me back on to stable again and then unenrolled from the beta program so I would stop getting them. T4rd It's times like this when I'm glad I'm just on Pure Nexus ROM. =p Vedang Jadhav This is new loop man, If you are not getting bootloop, Google is ensuring you atleast get this loop!! danthepotato Thank god I'm not the only one... I tried using the chat help on the settings. The guy basically told me I should opt out of beta, but I don't want to wipe my phone... JamesBennett360 If you update then opt out it will not wipe your device. I did it myself Carolacoffman Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Good to go VAL just unenrrolled the beta program and won´t show up F4LL0U7 Same. I'll just deal with the update icon for now until they fix it. Not interested in unenrolling and wiping my phone. rasty++ no wipe if you have n2g... Ronald Yup same issue, did the update got the notification downloaded the NPG47I but have not installed it yet Josh Hamer Yup, same thing happening to me Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google employs only the best and brightest. André Pudiesi Same here. Final, then prompted me the Beta again. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b59969b13e033f7b043512da60a6f94086726e1588fc48382fcdd40bcad52140.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0da4868bacccbb1d7ce49e3c804e23e92904bd5251a4eebb9a7de486b9d3aa17.png Curt Same. LondonLeedsFan Right.... So i got the stable build (25mb), and the beta build 1313.6mb straight after... I'm confused?! Midnitte Want the next update? Now, always have an update available! Chisel I'm also getting the NPG47I «--» N2G47H loop. Weird. phineasjw Yep. Same thing. Took the opportunity to leave the Beta program. Just make sure you leave when running N2G47H. tonyc That's the same thing that keeps happening to me. Garry I just cleared the app data for Google Play Services and so far that has alleviated the problem. Artem Russakovskii Google fixed the endless loop, guys. https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/6504su/anyone_else_get_a_stable_712_update_then/dg6oj2l/. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Same update for Nexus 5x alexus after I pulled this update, I got another one right after (build NPG471) Mitch G yeah, it keeps pushing old build on top of new build TxReplay Got it on Nexus 5X too ! clay hope this fixes the shutdowns when there is clearly battery left. my phone shuts down when it hits 15% left and wont turn back on until i charge K9 A bit off topic i haven't recieved assistant yet and i was thinking it was cause i was in beta. I just got the stable 7.1.2 but still no assistant. Services apps is up to date but nothing still. Wht shd i do? Carson Saldanha Is your Google app on English (US)? K9 Yes it is Carson Saldanha rip idk lol rasty++ stop ota please ..8 ota in 2 hours.. -.- Kyle Smith Got this on Nexus Player also, I like the new update animation and loading bar Ernie If you update to N2G47H and you are on the beta program. You will have to unenroll from the beta. rmagruder Just spotted this and unenrolled from the beta and annoying update message went away. Guess I'll stay out of the beta until they actually push out the next beta. 2 Men-E ...sooooo...after the comments, and selecting "Download", but before selecting "Install"...I shouldn't complete the update to this "final" 7.1.2 build [being that my 6P will just do OTA loops] 🤔 rmagruder Good LORD, Google. I just got this on my 6P. It updated the phone, and after rebooting with the final 7.1.2, it promptly gave me a new System update available message wanting to install a beta version of 7.1.2 (HPG47I) at a hefty cost of 1313.6Mb. What the heck? That was what I was JUST ON before getting the FINAL OTA. George Hadjidakis Just opt out from the beta program then back in and then out again and it will go.. Bruno Montini To everyone getting the update prompt again and again, clear cache partition, it fixed it for me I also left the beta before clearing cache Lateef Alabi-Oki If you "Check For Update" on the Nexus 5x you might get it too. I got it that way. Tim Meader Once you have the official update (installed) and have booted back up... just IGNORE the prompt to update back to the beta version. Go into the Beta Program settings and leave the program. Problem solved. F4LL0U7 I'm not looking to factory reset OR leave the beta program though... I'd imagine they have to fix this if so many people are getting it, right? Tim Meader There's no need to be in the beta program right now since there's no actual beta. You can easily go back to it at any time via the same method, that's not an issue. It takes 5 seconds to sign back up. As I said, if you've already installed the release update and rebooted, leaving the beta won't factory reset anything. F4LL0U7 Oh cool, I didn't realize you could opt out without wiping once you were on stable. Thanks! Razed Does this address the 6P battery issues? F4LL0U7 I just got updated to the final 7.1.2 build on my Nexus 5X (N2G47F). Same thing, around 25MB. And then a funny thing happened. I immediately was prompted to download and install the beta 2 (NPG47I). I am ignoring it for now, because I would imagine that installing that will knock me back to the pre-release version of 7.1.2, which I don't want. Anyone else getting this? TBBT+HIMYM The same thing with me. I should try to get out of beta probably. TBBT+HIMYM Yes. It works. F4LL0U7 But you probably had to wipe your phone when exiting the beta, right? TBBT+HIMYM No. Ignore the beta version message. Exit the beta and the message just disappears by itself. Wipe is not necessary. F4LL0U7 Awesome, thanks! danthepotato Opting out once you are on N2G47H solves the problem, without a pesky notification or need to wipe your phone Jacob Mcalister Tattoos I'm still on the beta on pixel xl.. anyone else like this? Anthony Castanza Small Pixel, still on beta, no OTA in sight. el_smurfo How do you have a 6P with the battery so low to update, yet it hasn't long since shut off prematurely at 30-40%? noneofthem Thanks, everybody. I was afraid to be the only one with that issue. I hope Google will find a solution to this fast. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google phone users are always bragging that they're the first to get updates. Now Google has taken it to the next level. Google phone users are the first to get into a continuous, never-ending update loop. Callanish Pure hyperbolic bullshit. There never was a never-ending update loop. All anyone had to do was pay attention to what was going on with the updates and have an incline of knowledge about what it means to be enrolled in the beta program. They'd have seen that the patch was upgrading them to the stable 7.1.2 release. They would have then seen, after rebooting, that there was a glitch with a beta installation trying to get them to install itself over a stable version. Beta 101 enrollment and research would have told them that if they were on a stable version, unenrolling from the beta program would not delete their data and any notification asking them to revert back to a beta version would be gone once unenrolled. That would have eliminated something easily solveable and have avoided giving someone like you a smug 'sky is falling' response making it seem like all this was a big deal. If you're going to be a guinea pig, by running a beta version on a phone, you've got to take some responsibility when things go pear shape and at least use common sense and learn the basics of being part of the beta program beforehand so you can at least recognize when, in this case, the user is causing the loop themselves by continuously downloading whatever the Google Notification is telling them to download and not paying attention to the fact that they are installing a beta version over a stable version creating this self inflicted problem. Charlie I have the same issue. I was confused a bit too. But I think what is going on is the final build date is after the beta 2 build date. So to the system it looks like your not on the latest build. That is why we could not side load the OTA without opting out of beta program because if your on beta 2 it looks like your on the latest build. I don't know why they do that but this is not the first time it has happened. Usually they fix the issue before the OTA is sent out so we don't get the notification for the beta build though. Lucas Cannon 5X as well, received an update stating it would be build N2G47H, then after reboot says build N2G47F. Andre Laurence I just got the final version update. It was a flawless install. FCEEVIPER I installed the OTA NPG47I, then I turned away from my phone and saw the phone was asking for a restartinstall but I did not notice that the restart would be installing NPG471. Maybe I should be paying more attention. : Should I opt out of beta to get the stable build? I'm confused. Erroneus When you have the final version installed (N2G47H), opt out of the beta program. That solves it. KosmoCrisis Me too. Nexus 6p on Project Fi, no different. This type of loop is not fun. onekage Thought it was strange to receive a beta update after receiving the​ final version I had been waiting for, for over a week. Let's hope battery life is a little better... But with a 25mb update I don't have much hope. Hopefully they do something cool with O. BBpost As someone mentioned below, I cleared out the cache for Google Play Services while on N2G47H and rebooted. This fixed the constant update cycle bug. Alvin persaud Install the "h" update first then "I" update (large)when it prompts u back to update to "h" just restart the phone and it should be good to go. Dan Zunko Nexus 5x just got the update. No loop so far. M.R. Betz 5X is up too. N2G47F for my 5X. jdawg0024 Google is also updating the Nexus 5x beta to final as well. I got the update just an hour ago TheDrunkenClam I have tried three times to install this OTA using Flashfire and cannot for the life of me get it to work. Flashfire detects it just fine, but once it fails, I don't know where the OTA resides after it is downloaded so I cannot find where it is to get it to try again (Flashfire doesn't automatically see it on the second attempt after that initial attempt for some reason). So I have been opting out of beta and then back in for it to re download the OTA and thus have Flashfire recognize. 1. Where does the OTA resides after it's downloaded? 2. Any settings in Flashfire that I should look for? idna As far as I can remember, the OTA resides in /data/ota_package (N5X, but it should be the same). And FlashFire can detect it if it's there. But in the past I noticed another location (complicated path, don't remember it now) had been used and indeed, it was not visible for FlashFire - and when I pointed the program to this location it didn't detect anything. What I would recommend is to simply grab the 7.1.2 factory image, opt out of the beta program and simply write this (factory) image with FlashFire, of course without overwriting the userdata partition. That's what I did when the images where released some weeks ago, I couldn't wait for Google to push this special OTA for those of us using the beta program. lomsha The notification finally went away on O. Margaritas Ante Porcos Nexus 6p owners, don't rush to update. My 6p's battery dies within few moments after I've updated from 7.1.1. to 7.1.2. You know how Google reacts to this. Google ignores anything. Morenicano In celebration of fixing the update loop, Google has decided to make another message app F4LL0U7 This one will have a built-in shopping list, but users will only be able to access it via Google Glass. Morenicano ...and the Nexus Q 2 Men-E For some reason my 6P is no longer receiving this final OTA. I downloaded it early today, but did not install it. Since then, I rebooted my 6P, and the install notification went away, and now when I check for updates, nothing is there. AnthonyRyan89 I got the final build update today and updated it then an hour later I got another update for the beta again. Curt Left the beta now. Leeroy Jenkins Feels good to be a pixel user ;) oneyedmonkey Feels good to be a P̶i̶x̶e̶l̶ Nexus user ;) iboalali I got this update got my Nexus 5x yesterday sebastianer This is good. With the 5X after the previous beta, they took more than a month to release the OTA from Beta to Stable. Now only just a week. But from M to N...they released the stable OTA asap, maybe even before the official OTA. and that was even better. Rob Paek I hope this fixes the app crashing I've had lately Keith Boykin I'm stuck on NP47I and it keeps saying it is up to date. Guess I'll have to remove from beta and then re-enroll Marty Wait...Isn't "I" after "H"? Mine shows NPG47I. Why would an "update" be named in a retroactive manner? mrjayviper Goggle with all the feels on its payroll can't solve/perfect OTA updates Wy Elkins Happened on my Nexus 5X yesterday. Finally settled down. Got the April Security update this morning.

That’s changing today with the latest update to WebVR. Now almost anyone with an Android smartphone and Cardboard headset can watch and experience virtual reality content without downloading a dedicated app. All you have to do is navigate to Google’s WebVR Experiments website, tap one of the experience and put on their Cardboard headset. Unfortunately, iPhone Cardboard users are out of luck because Google has yet to make WebVR compatible with iOS. If you don’t own either a Daydream View or Cardboard headset, it’s still possible to check out all of Google’s WebVR experiences as long as you have Chrome web browser installed on your computer. Of course, it won’t be quite as immersive, as you’ll have to tap or drag your finger to navigate each experience.

For the uninitiated, an Easter Egg is a fun little trick that's hidden inside a platform or service. Easter Eggs aren't usually a feature of the app, but an intentional little quirk intended to be a fun little bonus.  Google is famous for its Easter Eggs, and those hidden in Hangouts do not disappoint. Here are some of the cute, clever tricks Google hid inside.  View As: One Page Slides Hatching chicks and hopping bunnies appear when you wish someone a "Happy Easter" or type in "Easter bunny." Google Love ponies? Type "/ponystream" and a herd of My Little Ponies will gallop across your chat. For just one pony, type "/ponies." The ponies will keep galloping until you manually turn them off. Type "/ponystream" again and they'll leave.  If you want something a little less sweet, type "/pitchforks." That will send an angry mob of townspeople across your screen. Google The command "/shydino" will send a tiny dinosaur running across your screen to hide behind a house. According to the Huffington Post, users were mistaking the house emoji for a dinosaur. So Google made them their own "/shydino" command.  Wishing friends a happy birthday triggers a festive birthday cake animation.   Here's one to break out on January 1: Try typing "Happy New Year!" Google If you're excited about something, type "woot!!" (and make sure you have two exclamation points).   Same goes for "LMAO."   Entering "lolololol" triggers the same two little animated friends laughing. Source: Tech Junkie Typing "/bikeshed" turns your and your friend's windows a random color. Google In the mood to celebrate? "Woohoo!!" brings up a cute emoji to cheer along with you.   And sending "xoxoxoxo" triggers some virtual hugs and kisses. Google Source: Tech Junkie Get the latest Google stock price here.

 Burger King is defying Google's attempt to stifle its latest ad in epic corporate feud Hayley Peterson Apr. 13, 2017, 12:00 PM 5,788 facebook linkedin twitter email print Burger King's new ad has a major flaw. YouTube/Burger King Burger King and Google got into a feud Wednesday over the fast-food chain's latest TV ad, and Burger King came out victorious. The Burger King ad triggered Google Home devices to recite the definition of a Whopper. Burger King debuted the ad online on Wednesday, before airing it on TV, and Google swiftly shut it down by disabling the ad's prompt from triggering its devices.  Google used the ad's audio to disable it. So Burger King responded by secretly tweaking the ad's audio so it could circumvent Google, and still trigger the home devices.  The tweak was very slight, but it worked, and the ad — which aired during Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday — successfully prompted Google Home to recite the Whopper definition.  The Google feud wasn't the only snafu Burger King encountered with its new ad.  The ad pulls the definition of a Whopper from Wikipedia, and on Wednesday, people were editing the page to say that the burger was made of ingredients like a "medium-sized child," instead of beef patty, and that it contains the toxic chemical Cyanide.  Wikipedia locked the page from additional edits ahead of the ad's TV launch, however, so the definition written by Burger King was recited as planned.  On Thursday, the new ad was still successfully triggering Google Home devices, according to a test by Business Insider. Here's Burger King's original TV ad:   Here's the new ad:   Get the latest Google stock price here.

Here’s how it will work: When a user searches a political subject or phrase, the returns will focus on news and information that has supposedly been vetted and determined to be true or false, as part of Google’s post-election effort to stop the spread of fake news. “The fact-checking feature, which was first introduced to Google News in the UK and U.S. in October, will now be displayed as an information box in general search results as well as news search results globally,” The Guardian reported. And just who is Google depending on to ‘fact-check’ news reports? Only some of the most Left-wing organizations known to the media business – organizations that have a demonstrable, chronic anti-liberty, anti-constitutional, anti-conservative bias and who are very often wrong because of their political ideology. (RELATED: Facebook’s “Fake News” Crackdown Is A Deliberate Attempt To Destroy The Independent Media) As reported by Breitbart News’ Warner Todd Huston, those “left-of-center gatekeepers” of news honesty include Snopes.com, Politifact, ABC News and The Associated Press. All this really amounts to is the latest effort by media liberals to once again gain control over the daily news narrative – telling Americans what they want them to hear and how they ought to think about and respond to the narrative. Facebook is jumping on the “fake news” bandwagon too, for that matter, partnering with many of the same organizations as Google. In December, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, a huge supporter of twice-vanquished Hillary Clinton, posted on his account an explanation of why his company is taking its action. “We’re a new kind of platform for public discourse — and that means we have a new kind of responsibility to enable people to have the most meaningful conversations, and to build a space where people can be informed,” he wrote. In a word, bull. “A new kind of responsibility” is nothing more than a euphemism for implementing old-fashioned censorship, in this case of the alternative media that played such an important role in revealing bombshell after bombshell during last year’s election cycle, and then serving as a platform for that news to spread. “This is a disaster for news coverage,” wrote the Daily Wire’s Ben Shapiro. “It’s an attempt to restore gatekeepers who have a bias as the ultimate arbiters of truth. If these organizations begin questioning articles and penalizing outlets for simple political disagreements rather than outright factual falsities, conservatives will have to go elsewhere for their news.” And that’s precisely what is about to happen: Certain political viewpoints and reporting will be censored via labeling as “fake news” or “false,” even when they’re not. As for those “fact checkers?” Let’s examine them: — As noted by The Federalist, when ‘fact-checking’ Republican and Democratic figures, the latter fared much better: When fact-checked by PolitiFact, Democrats had an average rating of 1.8, which is between “Mostly True” and “Half True.” The average Republican rating was 2.6, which is between “Half-True” and “Mostly False.” We also checked Republicans without President-elect Donald Trump in the mix and found that 0.8 truth gap narrowed to 0.5. Bias? Of course. — Then there are the outright fabrications. As reported by TruthWiki, Snopes was founded and, for the longest time, operated by a married couple who had no particular training, education or experience investigating news reporting: David and Barbara Mikkelson, husband and wife from San Fernando Valley, started their “neutral” blog of shoddy, liberal-bent research over a decade ago, posting time and time again their “final factual words” that aren’t really facts at all. Snopes repeatedly explains away criticisms towards liberal politicians and other leftist public figures while character assassinating conservatives. — ABC News and The Associated Press fare only slightly better, but both carry the same Left-wing bias in their reporting. The point is, Facebook and Google are not out to rid their feeds of so-called “fake news.” They are out to rid their feeds of reporting and political opinion which does not fit their liberal worldview, and in doing so impugning the reporters and editors of those news organizations, period.

Biggest privacy myths debunked We clear up the concerns of consumers about Google's smart speaker. By James Billington April 13, 2017 17:31 BST A spy in the home? Not so likely. Let the truth set you freeGoogle Is Google Home always listening to me? It's one of the most common questions asked about the voice-activated smart speaker. With wary consumers still unsure whether Google is spying on their conversations, it's time to separate the fact from fiction. Google Home is muscling in on Amazon's dominance in the market, meaning there's going to be a whole new audience of people looking cockeyed at the little speaker. IBTimes UK has already busted the privacy myths surrounding Amazon's Echo, now let us set the record straight and help quell any fears over Google's ominous omniscience – it's not eavesdropping. IBTimesUK spoke to Google engineers about how it works and what it does with your data. Is Google Home spying on conversations? The biggest myth about Google Home is that it's continually recording what you say in the privacy of your home. While technically its microphone is always on, it's only listening out for the 'Okay, Google' hotword to activate it. It only records around two-seconds of audio, discards the snippet, then starts again. Anything that was recorded isn't saved we were told. Like the Amazon Echo, the speaker's microphone is constantly listening out for users to say the hotword to activate it and will display its four coloured LEDs on the top to let you know it has an ear out. It's not bugging your home like some reports lead you to believe. You can freely talk about your darkest secrets next to your Home without any fear it's setting off any alarms at Google HQ. Can I stop Google Home from listening? Yes. A microphone mute button is located at the back. It has an icon of a microphone with a line diagonally through it. You could also switch the unit off altogether if you're really paranoid, but as we've explained, you don't need to do that and there wouldn't be much point in owning one if you did. Google Home is a smart Bluetooth speaker with personal assistant costing £129IBTimes UK Is Google Home storing my activity? Yes. We know Google isn't jotting down endless conversations in the privacy of your home but what you should know is that any questions, queries and commands you direct at Google Home are stored on its servers for an indefinite amount of time. This may sound slightly unsettling but Google assures us it's not for nefarious purposes – it's to make its Home more effective. The more search queries owners feed google Home the smarter it becomes. The reason why Google's online search is so good at getting results is because its deep learning has refined the answers over 18 years for billions of searches, including ones that are full of typos or inaccurate. It also gathers data to make Google Home offer more personalised answers to users. Where things get less transparent is when you use Services. Third party app-like add-ons such as Uber and Domino's do store your conversation history (things like last pizza you ordered) so next time you use it it'll be able to remember your preferences. According to Google, it transcribes what you say and sends the text, but not the audio, to the third-party service provider. Can I delete my activity? Yes. Users are able to see everything they've asked Google Home on the Google Home app and delete as desired. To do this you need to tap the menu button (three vertical lines) at the top left corner and select more settings. Scroll to the bottom of the page and tap 'My Activity'. Here you will see all your interactions. Tap the options icon (three vertical dots) on any activity and hit delete to remove it from results. Can Google Home access my personal data? Yes. But only if you allow it. One of Google Home's selling points is that it can connect to your Gmail, calendar and location data (ie maps) so it can tell you what you've got on the schedule for the day and things like if there's traffic on your daily commute. Of course, you can turn this all off by going to the My Activity section of the app but you'd be losing a rather useful feature of the device. Does Google Home share my personal data with anyone? Yes and no. According to Google's Home support page it does not sell your personal information to anyone, however it says it does share information with some third parties. It lists an example of ordering an Uber through Google Home, whereby it would send the company your details in order to process the transaction. Is Google Home or Amazon Echo more secure? Neither should fan fears of eavesdropping. They both work in very similar ways to how they 'listen' out to owners' hotword and both have activity logs in their respective apps where you can delete interactions as you please. They both will share your information with some third parties if you give it permission but this will likely to be something you would have needed to supply in order to use that Service or Skill in the first place.

While the name Google Earth may not be an every day household name, Google has been regularly updating one of its original huge projects with tons of features over the past couple of years.  Near the end of last year we saw a big VR update for Google Earth that brought some unbelievable views of the world right to your face via an HTC Vive, or other compatible Steam VR headsets that might be in the wings.  This brought Google’s new high resolution imagery to life by letting users walk around the world when and where they want, exploring deep down into places and seeing things as if they were really there.  Google has also brought its open source mantra to Google Earth Enterprise, a service that was once a well utilized paid service to give companies the freedom and flexibility to build their own custom maps and data using the power of the Google Earth Engine. What’s in store for the latest build of Google Earth?  There aren’t any hints right now, and given that Google has reach all across platforms, whether it be desktops, mobile devices or in VR space, it’s difficult to wonder exactly what they’ll be doing.  Given that they’re unveiling it right before Earth Day 2017, however, it’s likely it has something specific to do with historical data and a better visual representation of events transpiring around the Globe.  Google has been very forthcoming with its data and utilizing it to paint a picture of world events, specifically Climate Change and other disastrous events that are continually affecting our planet.  Google’s elaborate timelapse engine shows changes from 1984 to 2016 anywhere on the map, utilizing multiple sources and showing cloudless imagery from around the world to better understand the changes the planet has gone through in the past few years.  Will this new announcement be an extension of this project, or a new one entirely?  We’ll find out in just a short week!

The San Francisco firm on Thursday said it reached the environmental milestones by investing in wind power systems, designing energy-efficient data centers and buildings, and by purchasing credits from clean energy projects to offset its remaining fossil fuel use. "We're seeing the urgency to act on climate change now more than ever," said Patrick Flynn, Salesforce's senior director of sustainability. SEE ALSO: Google's data centers, offices will use 100% renewable energy in 2017 Salesforce is part of a larger movement by global tech companies to confront their sector's growing carbon footprint. After all, storing data in the cloud and streaming millions of movie and music files still has a major environmental impact. Data centers brimming with servers consume enormous amounts of energy, as do the offices where software developers, engineers, and coders work. If tech giants get that electricity from coal or natural gas, instead of renewables, the sector's emissions will balloon. View photos Image: salesforce To that end, Google has said it will power 100 percent of its data centers and offices with wind and solar power starting this year. Apple is investing in clean energy not only at its own buildings but also its manufacturing sites, a move that helped it earn the top score on Greenpeace's 2017 "Clicking Clean" report card. In that report, Salesforce earned a "B," mainly because the rapidly growing company has expanded into areas that largely rely on coal-fired electricity. Emissions from Salesforce's data centers more than doubled in a year's time, from 52,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent in fiscal year 2015 to about 110,000 metric tons in fiscal year 2016, the company reported. Flynn said that's precisely why Salesforce has accelerated its clean energy efforts. The company last year signed two 12-year agreements to purchase power from wind farms in Texas and West Virginia. Both projects are expected to generate a combined 225,000 megawatt-hours of electricity each year — slightly less than the 265,000 megawatt-hours of electricity Salesforce directly consumed during the last fiscal year.

The first project helps families in Honduras replace wood-burning cookstoves with more efficient alternatives to reduce harmful indoor air pollution and carbon emissions. A project in India will help put solar water heaters atop houses, buildings, and universities to displace the use of fossil fuels. Salesforce first committed to achieving net-zero emissions in 2015 as part of a "Net Zero by 2050" initiative led by the B Team, a group of global business leaders. To reach that goal, Salesforce purchased enough clean electricity credits to cover the emissions from its offices and data centers, plus the power plants that keep its servers running. Salesforce said it would also create a carbon-neutral cloud by offsetting emissions further down the supply chain, such as emissions related to installing servers in data centers.

Unfortunately, that ease of use also makes them particularly vulnerable to trolling, and while you might expect such shenanigans from a bored friend, you probably won’t be prepared for a Burger King commercial to attempt a hijack of your know-it-all speaker. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what was about to happen, before Google stepped in to save the day. Don't Miss: A lot of people don’t like Netflix’s new ratings system The ad, which suggests that because the Whopper is just such an awesome menu item it can’t be fully described in such a short ad slot, ends with a Burger King restaurant employee saying “Ok Google, what is the Whopper burger?” If you happen to have a Google Home speaker nearby, or even an Android device like a smartphone or tablet with the voice command enabled, the goofy ad would have prompted your gadget to begin reciting the Whopper description from Wikipedia. That is, if Google hadn’t seen the ad for itself and pushed a hotfix that prevents the ad from triggering anything. It’s a funny trick, at least in concept, but in reality the idea of an advertisement prompting one of your own devices to continue the ad in a different form is really, really obnoxious. That sentiment seems to be carrying over to Burger King’s YouTube comments section and ratings, too, as it now has a negative overall like/dislike ratio as well as plenty of complaints from, well, pretty much everyone. Would-be customers with an already establish distrust of advertising aren’t likely to find this kind of thing all that entertaining.

The company’s smart speaker, which is powered by the AI-backed Google Assistant, is now capable of monitoring airline prices. Google Home can also help plan trips and check flight statuses. You can give Google Home a relevant voice command if you need it to track a flight status for you, however, for this feature to work you will need to have Personal Results turned on. It can also find information about flights and their prices and can even suggest what popular activities that you should look into doing when you reach your destination. For example, to get information about their current flights, Google Home users can give voice commands like “Ok Google, is my flight on time?” They can even add an airline name in there to get the correct answer. For the price tracking feature, commands like “Ok Google, How much are flights to New York City in 3 weeks?” will work. Flight search can also be filtered by airline, dates, and by the number of stops. To get suggestions on what to do when you get there, just ask “Ok Google, what are the things to do in Paris?” Makes life so much easier, doesn’t it? Filed in Gadgets.

The ad has a Burger King employee saying “OK, Google. What is the Whopper burger?” This has the virtual assistant read the description of the hamburger from Wikipedia. Burger King, which is owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc (NYSE:QSR) edited Wikipedia before the ad went live. It changed the description so that the virtual assistant would heap praises on its sandwich. Unfortunately for Burger King, Wikipedia was quick to change back its edits. Also, once people figured out what the company was up to, they made their own edits to Wikipedia. This includes describing the Whopper burger as the “worst hamburger product”. Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) Google has also blocked the ad and says it wasn’t involved in it, reports BBC News. Google likely blocked Burger King’s “OK Google” ad by registering the audio in its database. It does this with its own commercials to keep them from triggering the devices. This means that owners of the virtual assistants can still ask it what a whopper burger is and get a response. Wikipedia is also putting an end to the shenanigans that the Burger King commercial started. It has locked the Whopper Burger Wikipedia page. This means that only authorized administrators are allowed to make edits to it, The Verge notes.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A Diversifying Ad Spend: Why Mobile Marketers Need Both David and Goliath by Tom Cummings  |   April 13, 2017  |  291 views Tweet Kindle Email Top Mobile advertising is dominated by two giants, Facebook and Google. In fact, 85% of mobile advertising spend goes to those two channels, and they both now identify mobile as a primary area of importance for future growth. Facebook's mobile revenue is projected to grow by more than 50% year over year, with Google's growing at a healthy 20%. How did Facebook and Google come to dominate the top of the mobile ad food chain? For starters, each boasts a network of more than a billion daily users. This enables both companies to offer high-quality targeting at a massive scale that most other channels can't replicate. Facebook predicted early on that highly targeted app installs would be popular with advertisers. It guessed correctly, and now Facebook's mobile ad practice fuels more than 80% of its $5.2 billion annual advertising revenue stream. Meanwhile, Google has long been the dominant player in search advertising, which makes up the bulk of the $19 billion it earns in advertising revenue. Mobile is playing an increasingly important role as more than half of Google searches are now done on mobile, which some analysts estimate account for more than half of Google's ad revenue. Despite such dominance, marketers run the risk of relying too much on these two networks to deliver the marketing results they need. Advertisers can't accurately see into the walled gardens that these giants create, and that lack of transparency can create problems for non-diversified ad campaigns—such as finding out that metrics are being artificially inflated. Using Facebook or Google isn't a bad plan: Whether they're running broad campaigns or precise targeting, most advertisers on mobile will find Facebook and Google to be effective. But marketers who also seek the help of other players in the market will be more successful in the fight for mobile customers. Spreading spend across a variety of channels presents the highest likelihood of optimal ad performance. From contributing third-party tracking tools and data, to verifiable metrics and alternative personas, a diverse portfolio of advertising channels and platforms can effectively complement efforts on Facebook and Google, as well as minimize risk. Using a multitude of ad channels allows one platform's strength to make up for another's weakness—and vise-versa. By focusing on one channel only, marketers subject themselves to risk—poor targeting, low reach, limited reporting. For marketers wondering when the right time to diversify might be, consider the following: If you're noticing that your advertising is flatlining, or not seeming to resonate with your target audience, it may be time to diversify. For example, Facebook may be targeting "pet owners," but it's really just reaching people who like looking at pictures of puppies. Just because a campaign is focused on a defined group of users, doesn't necessarily result in accuracy. During the holiday gift-giving season, an influx of new phones and tablets creates all new opportunities for marketers, as users of those new devices tend to download new apps. That tendency continues for weeks, so the post-holiday lull provides a great opportunity to get the most bang for your marketing buck: As major spending dies down, ad costs fall back to earth. If you're having to spend more than expected on Facebook, don't be surprised. It's a highly effective and popular platform, which means that demand continues to increase, leading to a competitive advertising environment. As Facebook gets more expensive, marketers may want to consider devoting a greater portion of their ad budget across other platforms. Beyond channel diversification, the most effective marketers also take varied approaches to the ways they buy media. For example, when the goal is to build awareness among users who received a new device, cost-per-click (CPC) campaigns will achieve awareness quickly with the best return on investment, especially around the holidays, when cost-per-install starts (CPI) to rise. Though CPC is a volume-based approach to media buying, ads can still be incredibly targeted if the pool of users being addressed is large enough—and, in addition to the giants, the largest of today's DSPs (demand-side platforms) and ad networks can draw on billions of user profiles. Diversification doesn't mean sacrificing performance or features. In fact, it's one of the best ways to deploy the full force of the various strengths of each channel: Quality DSPs use their own data to add to what Facebook and Google do well, which is making ad buying smarter through the use of persona mapping, lookalike modeling, and algorithmic learning. The ability to target specific audiences is not limited to Facebook and Google. Some of Facebook's most compelling features for precision targeting, like programmatic lookalike modeling, are becoming common among other ad-buying platforms. Diversified spending demands a single tracking and attribution system to collect all results in a central location. Having that in place makes it very easy to compare costs and results across the various channels and optimize your campaigns accordingly. A marketing approach that diversifies tends to perform more effectively and tap additional audiences, reaching people in multiple ways to maximize conversion opportunities. The dominance of Facebook and Google makes each an essential component of a well-rounded ad strategy, but complementing them with additional channels will increase the likelihood of reaching an audience that will provide real business results.

The company has now quietly launched a similar service in India. Google Areo is more focused on food delivery and home services, like calling an electrician. Nintendo Switch Areo aggregates “thousands of local goods and services,” including “restaurants, providers, and chefs” for food delivery, and “electricians, painters, cleaners, plumbers, and more” for home maintenance. Google partnered with several prominent services in the country, but missed integrations with other large players, including an Amazon-backed home service. The app has a simple interface, with cards listing the categories of services you can order from Areo. Tapping and drilling down allows users to filter through results. There is also a more general search, as well as detailed ratings and reviews. Deliveries and services can be booked and scheduled at specific times. Checkout is done via netbanking, card, or with cash during delivery. The Economic Times notes that unlike previous services, Google is completing the payment process for the merchant right in the app. For the moment, Areo is only available in Bangalore and Mumbai. This launch continues the trend of recent Google rollouts in the country. Play Music subscriptions launched earlier this month, as did a beta version of the lightweight YouTube Go.

After neglecting Earth for several years, Google seems to be substantially reviving it, possibly by emphasising virtual reality. Google Earth has long been seen as the more powerful, desktop-bound alternative to Google Maps. It features robust exploration tools, the ability to measure distances across the Earth, guided tours around the planet and even a built-in flight simulator. Recently, Google has opted to concentrate its development onto Maps itself, owing to its cross-platform and cross-device nature. As Maps has grown, it has increasingly overlapped with the aging Earth, leading to it becoming gradually more irrelevant. There are still lots of users who rely on Earth's powerful functionality though. In a move that will please these people, Google today revealed Earth is far from being dead. It has officially invited the press to the launch event for a new version. READ MORE: Huawei's chief executive hasn't figured out why we need smartwatches As reported by The Next Web, Google will host an event "for the unveiling of the new Google Earth" next Tuesday April 18. The date is four days before Earth Day, a detail unlikely to be coincidental. This year's Earth Day campaign is centred on improving environmental literacy, an area it's possible a new Google Earth could assist in. The invitations give little away about the new program. Google has clearly been hard at work behind the scenes though. It's rare a new software launch gets a dedicated press event and Google usually announces updates to its products in blog posts. Everything points towards a substantial rethinking of Earth. It's possible Google is planning to relaunch the program with a renewed standalone focus, perhaps orienting it more towards environmental concerns than outright mapping. This would allow Earth to evolve into a distinct app in its own right with a clear purpose distinct from the ever-growing Maps. Google is also talking about a "brand new experience" for Earth, a phrase which could reveal at least one of the incoming features. It’s likely this alludes to virtual reality support using Google's new Daydream VR platform. A VR-compatible version of Earth is already available on PC gaming platform Steam. Google may now expand Earth's VR features to make them more broadly available on a range of devices. Although nothing will be confirmed until Tuesday, the new Earth looks set to be focused on educational and explorational use. With Maps now surpassing the current Earth in functionality, the new program is likely to boast features not currently supported in Google products. The company is evidently confident it can bring something new to the table, relaunching Earth with a conspicuously large fanfare.

The latest addition is no exception, with image searches for fashion products now offering new “style ideas” in the Google Android app and on mobile browsers. So, tapping on an image for a Zara bag, for example, will pop up the usual information on where the picture is from, but it will also offer a gallery of “inspirational lifestyle images and outfits” that showcase the bag in the real world. Google says that the idea is to let users see their outfits in real-world settings to see how things fashionably fit together before they buy. It’s a feature that looks very... Pinterest-y, for lack of a better term, with the fashion-focused recommendations based on your existing searches. Of course, Google sells ads, too, and the style ideas feature is no exception. It announced earlier this week, along with the fashion tips, that image search will also offer some similar items for you to buy. The new features should be rolling out to users soon.

Oracle seems to believe it can top public cloud market leaders Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google’s Cloud Platform without as many data centres. Each of these companies both build and sell large arrays of servers, storage and networking to businesses, many of which look to them for help in building data centres. According to a recent report from Canalys, Amazon Web Services (AWS) alone holds 33.8 percent of the cloud market share for 2016, whilst Microsoft, Google and IBM combined hold 30.8 percent. Surprisingly, Oracle falls behind by holding just 1.7 percent of that market, but despite this Oracle’s CEO, Mark Hurd believes the company’s minimal data centres are more efficient as they run hardware and supercharged databases. In an interview with Fortune, Mark Hurd, CEO, Oracle said: “If I have two-times faster computers, I don’t need as many data centres. If I can speed up the database, maybe I need one fourth as many data centres. I can go on and on about how tech drives this. Read more: Cloud wars: Oracle CEO labels AWS infrastructure ‘old’ “Our core advantage is what we’ve said all along, which is that it’s about the intellectual property and the software, not about who’s got the most real estate.” The company argues that it performs faster and more effectively than its cloud rivals with less data centres, claiming that its big machines are cheaper and more efficient. This is Oracle’s Exadata servers, which features a scale-out design with industry-standard servers in the form of turbocharged machines. Although, in comparison AWS recently announced that it has converted 22,000 databases from other vendors to its own database services. In which, Oracle’s Hurd said: “How much database market will Oracle lose to Amazon Aurora? My guess is close to zero. “The third largest database in the world is IBM DB2, and it’s been going out of business for 20 years. If it was so easy to replace databases, DB2 market share would be zero.” The company’s CEO also previously referred to AWS’ infrastructure as “old,” comparing it to its own technology which he claims is “newer and fresher.”   Tags AWS Cloud Wars Google Cloud Platform Homepage News List Microsoft Azure Oracle Sidebar Most Read Previous ArticleOpen Source Hippie to Software Standard: Ubuntu CEO signs off on a decade at Canonical Next ArticleAI acquisition sees Baidu gear up for self driving cars Most read Red Hat brings legacy apps back to the future with Kubernetes James Nunns 13th April 2017 Cloud wars: Oracle CEO plans to beat AWS without as many data centres Hannah Williams 13th April 2017 Accenture claims to be the biggest user of cloud & Office 365 in the world Byomakesh Biswal 12th April 2017 Over a quarter would trust robots over doctors with heart surgery Ellie Burns 11th April 2017 What went Wonga?

The ad, which launched Wednesday on TV networks including Comedy Central, MTV, History, Bravo, and MTV as well as during NBC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in the Los Angeles, New York, and Miami markets, featured a man portraying a Burger King employee lamenting that he doesn't have time to explain the Whopper to his audience. The man attempts to trigger viewers' Google Home and Android devices with the command: "OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?" The command was functioning when the ad was first made available online, but viewers soon noticed a fatal flaw in the ad: The Google Home's response was to read out the Wikipedia entry for the Whopper, which users can edit. Tests of the ad and its Google functionality Tuesday resulted in the Whopper being said to contain a "medium-sized child" as well as toxic cyanide, among its regular ingredients. Burger King was able to correct the Wikipedia entry, but Google, which said it had not been consulted by Burger King, further harmed the ad's effectiveness Wednesday by making changes that prevented its devices from being activated by the commercial.

Google Blocks Burger King Whopper Ad From Triggering Google Home Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Blocks Burger King Whopper Ad From Triggering Google Home April 13, 2017 10:45 am EDT By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk ADS advertising badvertising burger king commercials google Google Home sorry not sorry whopper Well, that was quick: Soon after Burger King launched a new ad designed to force any Google Home devices within range to wake up and spit out a list of the Whopper’s ingredients, Google has apparently disabled the functionality that triggers the devices. At least, the ad no longer prompts Google Home to recite the Whopper’s Wikipedia page, reports The Verge, though a real human being can still ask the device to call up that information. That makes it likely that Google registered the specific sound clip from the commercial so it won’t wake up Google Home, something it does for its own commercials for the device, notes The Verge. In the ad, an actor dressed like a Burger King worker speaks directly to the camera, saying that the 15-second spot isn’t enough time to explain the fresh ingredients in the Whopper. “But I got an idea,” he adds, uttering Google Home’s wake word as the camera gets closer. “OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?” Google did confirm on Wednesday that it wasn’t involved in creating the ad, but declined to comment on it further. Update: Burger King changed the audio of the commercial, and it is reportedly triggering speakers again.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Google joins the efforts to halt the spread of fake news 13 Apr 2017 0 Facebook, Fake news, Google Post navigation Previous: Smartphone sensors offer hackers a way past security PINs Next: Android malware creators throw up a roadblock to thwart the good guys by Alison Booth 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Earlier this week, Google rolled out a new tool to help users around the globe differentiate between real and fake news. Tested on news stories in a handful of countries over recent months, the “Fact Check” tag adds additional information to some of the technology giant’s search and news results. As a Google blog post explains: This label identifies articles that include information fact checked by news publishers and fact-checking organisations… so people can make more informed judgements The snippet that’s added reveals the claim and who made it, along with the name of the organisation that checked it and what they concluded. It’s possible that some news article or search result could include more than one tag. That’s because Google won’t be checking out the facts itself; the checking is down to the 115 organisations that make up the fact-checking community. Google believes that readers will find the different opinions useful: Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree. Conversely, not every news article or search result will include the extra information. Not every article will be checked and Google won’t publish every check completed. The content, publisher and fact check claim must meet the search giant’s standards and adhere to its policies for the fact-check label to appear. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More While Google’s announcement was generally well received as a tool to help in the fight back against fake news, some felt it didn’t go far enough. As TechRadar commented: It doesn’t do anything to affect the ranking of the articles. If the fact check article would normally show up on page four, it will still show up on page four. Facebook, on the other hand, is actively pushing potentially fake news down its news ranking. In a recent blog post, the social media giant explained that, since a lot of fake news is financially motivated, one of the most effective approaches is “removing the economic incentives for traffickers of misinformation”. In other words, making it less visible. To do that it is actively: Testing for signals that an article has misled people, so it can improve News Feed ranking algorithms and reduce the prevalence of false news content. Testing ways to make it easier for readers to report a false news story, with stories flagged as false by users showing up lower in the News Feed. Working independent third-party fact-checking organisations to flag potential fake news and reduce their ranking in the News Feed. It’s early days and we may see some of the other tech companies offer tools to help users spot and flag up fake news. For now, we’ll just have to wait and see whether these two efforts hold back the spread of fake news, or simply provide the reader with some additional information to help them make a more informed decision. In reality, however, the article from MIT has probably hit the nail on the head by saying “Fact-check alerts and handy tips to help spot misinformation are useful, but they place the onus firmly on users.” With the onus, it seems, likely to stay with each and every one of us for the time being, we recently shared some advice on how you can help in Fake news: what can we all do to play our part in combating it?

Wikipedia and Google have a beautiful relationship. Who better to team up other than the world's most prolific search engine and the world's most prolific information resource — it's the hippest power couple since Will and Jada Smith. But here's something that might drive a tiny wedge between the two, and it's a whopper. Every time you ask Google something, it usually gives the floor dibs to Wikipedia. And now, the both of them may have just discovered that the undemocratically high Page Rank Google accords to Wikipedia may create conditions for hilarious exploitation. On Wednesday, Burger King released a short ad. Lasting all of 15 seconds, the ingenious clip features a coy BK employee peering conspiratorially into the camera and enunciating: "Ok Google, what is the Whopper burger?" And boom. Like a hypnotic trigger, the phrase would prompt Google Home smart assistants all over the United States to read out a snappy — if overtly appetising — unsolicited description of Burger King's giant patty variant. Money saved, masses reached, and all that, for Burger King.   What made this ad ingenious is that the Wikipedia entry for 'whopper burger' was edited to have the wiki pop-out read an excerpt from the Product description — "The Whopper is a hamburger, consisting of a flame grilled quarter-pound (113.4 g) beef patty, sesame seed bun, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, and sliced onion." — instead of the first line, which provides rather dry information about the franchise. The Verge suspects, with good reason, that the entry was tampered with by a Burger King official. Google soon got wind of this, and bowdlerised the phrase from its search engine so that Google Home would no longer respond to it. The Verge, among others, tested the ad out to find that the phrase was no longer doing it for Home. Vulnerable Wiki Shortly after the ad aired, online users took to making their own edits to the now infamous wiki entry, adding their own creative — if repulsive — descriptives to the Whopper, the least offensive of them being a reference to "toenails". Soon, Wikipedia too locked the entry from being edited by unauthorised admin. But not before references to "cyanide", "cancer-causing", and "The Whopper is the worst hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King" made their way into it.   Burger King designs ad to set off Google Home. Which reminds me of this song I wrote a while back https://t.co/lTGtfI758l pic.twitter.com/S3LA7TGYPI — Robert Colvile (@rcolvile) April 13, 2017 According to The New York Times, José Cil, president of Burger King, said in an interview: “With the onset of consumers buying intelligent system devices and using them at home, we thought this was a good way to make a connection and go directly to guests and tell a story about our product.” Google may have a bone to pick with Burger King for damaging its Home device's reputation for being a personal ad-free assistant. But here's the thing. This isn't even the first sneak commercial attack pulled using Google Home this past month. Only, it was Google itself that slipped in the line promoting the opening of Disney film Beauty and The Beast into Home's daily My Day update on March 16. New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO — brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 Google, though, said in a statement that it was not a 'ad', but "timely content". "We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case." At any rate, in all this, the real moral of the story might be encapsulated by the question: "What about Alexa, Burger King?"

Google Earth has always been one of the most ambitious projects in the company’s repertoire, attempting to provide an exhaustive tour of the entire planet, from the depths of the Pacific Ocean to the heights of Mt. Everest. And now to celebrate Earth Day, Google is looking to take it to the next level. According to an invitation sent to Engadget and other media outlets, the search giant is planning to unveil a “brand new experience” for Google Earth on April 18 at the Whitney Museum of Art in New York City, ahead of Earth Day on April 22. While there aren’t too many details, the announcement says Google will be unveiling “the new Google Earth,” which will is almost certain to bring the HTC Vive-exclusive Google Earth VR app to Daydream. Launched last November, Google Earth VR lets you “fly over a city, stand at the top of the highest peaks, and even soar into space,” all without leaving your house. Available in the Steam store, Google promised that the experience, which “comes with cinematic tours and hand-picked destinations that send you to the Amazon River, the Manhattan skyline, the Grand Canyon, the Swiss Alps, and more,” would be coming to “other platforms” this year. A new frontier: If you’ve ever used Google Earth on the HTC Vive, you know how awesome it can be, so we’d love to see the same experience replicated on our Daydream and Gear VR headsets. Google Earth is one of those rare tools that combines education and entertainment into an engaging package, and a Daydream VR version could be a fantastic aid for learning about other lands and cultures without breaking schools’ budgets.

[Source photo: Flickr user Claire mono] By Dr. Andrew Chamberlain—Glassdoor04.13.17 | 11:00 am On Friday, the Department of Labor announced it had been investigating Google for paying women employees less than men. Google has disputed the allegations. But because this news made headlines around the world, and Glassdoor sits on a massive salary database comprised of millions of salary reports shared directly from employees themselves, we asked the question: Does Google have a gender pay gap problem? While the federal government didn’t disclose how it concluded that Google pays women employees differently from men, Glassdoor is uniquely positioned with thousands of salary reports from Google employees to shed some additional light on this issue. Below, I’ll show how we find no statistical gender pay gap in Google salaries, at least according to Google’s pay data shared by employees on Glassdoor. While pay gaps can be analyzed in a variety of ways, we believe the most thorough way to do so is to control for important variables that allow apples-to-apples comparisons. We outline this below. Related: Google’s Hardest Moonshot Will Be Debugging Its Race Problem How To Analyze The Gap As the chief economist at Glassdoor, I published an “employer’s guide” this month, with example code and data, that lays out a step-by-step process for how companies can perform their own gender pay audit. Our guide uses the same econometric methods you’ll find in academic journals in labor economics. It’s the way most expert economists, including economists at the Department of Labor, would almost always analyze payroll data for a gender pay gap. We’ve published a major study showing how to apply this methodology more broadly, and even applied it to Glassdoor’s own company payroll data. If there’s really a gender pay gap at Google, this method is how to correctly document it. Google Salaries On Glassdoor To analyze the gender pay gap at Google, we pulled a large sample of salaries shared by current and former Google employees on Glassdoor. Here’s the sample we looked at: U.S. Google base salaries from 2006 through 2017, shared on Glassdoor as of April 10, 2017; We looked at full-time employees only (no contract workers, interns, etc.); We looked only at workers who reported base pay between $30,000 and $250,000 per year (to exclude outliers). Below is a table summarizing our sample data. There are 1,967 Google salaries. The salaries are 78% male—Google’s own self-reported data show the company is about 69% male—and the average age of employees is 34. About 54% have bachelor’s degrees, 33% have master’s degrees, and 5% have PhDs. The average years of experience for these workers is 5.8 years. In this analysis, we only looked at base pay as reported on Glassdoor’s salary survey. That’s because we wanted to use our most reliable data. We don’t examine total compensation—which would include bonuses, tips, equity, commissions, and other forms of pay—because many people don’t report them correctly or consistently.   Google’s Pay Gap To analyze Google’s gender pay gap, we applied the same methodology from our guide. As we explain there, it can be misleading to simply compare male salaries as a group to female salaries as a group. Men and women often work in different roles and have different types of education and experience. Those things affect pay in the labor market, and have little to do with gender bias in compensation policies by any single employer. To correctly analyze the gender pay gap, you need to use regression analysis to control for observable differences between men and women, to see whether there’s really a pay gap once you’ve made an “apples-to-apples” comparison of men and women working in similar jobs, in similar locations, with similar education, performance, and experience. Below are our results. The gender pay gap in Google salaries is shown in the first row of the table. It shows the percentage pay advantage for male employees compared to females, both before and after adding statistical controls to compare similar workers. In the first column, we find an “unadjusted” pay gap—which is equivalent to average pay for men as a group compared to women as a group—of 16.3%. Adding controls for education, age, and years of experience, in the second column we see the gender pay gap shrinks to 13.1%. Finally, in the third column we add all statistical controls for year of the salary report, state of employment, and job title to assure we’re comparing men and women working in similar roles. This is what we call the “adjusted” gender pay gap. In that column, we see the pay gap shrinks to 1.6%—and is not statistically significantly different from zero. Once we make an apples-to-apples comparison of male and female workers at Google, it turns out that there’s no statistical evidence of a systematic gender pay gap—at least not in the Google salaries employees have shared on Glassdoor. Conclusion The Department of Labor hasn’t shared their data or methodology showing how they came to the conclusion that Google has a gender pay problem. In this post, we show that men on average do earn about 16.3% more than women at Google. But that’s not a complete or fair comparison, as it compares software engineers and marketing associates as if they’re in the same pay bracket. Instead, when we make an apples-to-apples comparison of workers with similar jobs and backgrounds, that 16.3% gender pay gap largely disappears. We find an “adjusted” gender pay gap at Google of about 1.6%, which is not statistically significantly different from zero. Put differently, there’s no evidence in salaries on Glassdoor of a systematic gender pay gap at Google. A version of this article originally appeared on Glassdoor. It is adapted with permission.

Bloomberg photo by Daniel Acker.   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     A Burger King ad designed to trigger Google's voice-activated Home smart speaker and have the device advertise the Whopper no longer works. The ad, released Wednesday, features an actor dressed as a Burger King employee, who says, "OK, Google: What is the Whopper burger?" The line is meant to trigger the device to reel off the definition of a Whopper using the first line of the burger's Wikipedia page. (Yes, the Whopper has its own Wikipedia page.) related advertisement   Roughly three hours after the ad launched, the ad stopped working. Google's Home would only light up in response to the commercial's prompt and stay mum (although it will give you the first line of the Wikipedia article if you explicitly request the definition of a "Whopper burger"). The fast-food company confirmed that the ad no longer triggers the speaker, but it said that it will still air the ad -- and indicated that the ad may start working again. "You'll have to tune in tonight to see if the commercial triggers the Whopper sandwich definition response," said Burger King spokesman Brooke Scher Mogan. Mogan said Burger King saw the ad as an opportunity to "do something exciting with the emerging technology of intelligent personal assistant devices." Google did not respond to requests for comment. A person familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak on the record said the fast-food chain did not consult Google before making the commercial. While commercials -- often those about home hubs -- have accidentally triggered voice assistants in people's homes before, this seems to be the first time an ad has tried to do it intentionally. Based on comments on the ad's YouTube page, many consumers did not appreciate having their devices hijacked. "When you take over someone's phone or tablet and have it do your own remote commands intentionally, you are HACKING," read one comment. In fact, it may be a blessing for Burger King that the ad no longer works as intended because the advertisement almost immediately backfired on the fast-food chain. Once the ad started gaining attention, Wikipedia users began altering the first line of the article about Burger King's Whopper. These edits included references to the burger as "cancer-causing" and stating that its ingredients include "cyanide." It appears that Burger King itself tried to fix the Wikipedia problem. The first sentence changed to a suspiciously glowing description of the Whopper, wrote by user "Fermachado123" -- a name that sounds similar to Fernando Machado, Burger King's senior vice president for global brand management. Burger King did not confirm or deny that Machado edited the article. Privacy concerns about voice-activated speakers and the connected home have been on the rise as more companies have introduced these products, putting pressure on the makers of voice-operated security systems and door locks to ensure that their devices can't be triggered by unauthorized voices. The place of advertising on the Google Home and similar products has been thoroughly debated by users as they have become more commonplace. Many users don't want to be spammed with ads delivered by what they consider personal assistants. Google subjected itself to criticism after Home users heard what appeared to be an unprompted plug for Disney's "Beauty and Beast" when the film opened last month. Google said at the time that mentioning the film wasn't meant to be an ad but simply a notice to users about what was timely that day, according to a statement provided to CNET. "We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case," a Google spokesman said.

You can now ask Google Home to tell you the price of a flight by specifying your destination and travel dates. After telling you the current price, Google Home will also offer to notify you when these prices fluctuate, a great feature since flight prices can change by the hour. Unfortunately, that’s where it ends. It won’t be able to carry out a full flight booking for you, so if you want to go through that process you’ll need to defer to a browser, be it on mobile or a desktop computer. That’s not so much Google’s fault as it is a quirk of dealing with third-party booking. Nonetheless, it’s nice to have an easy way to keep up on flight prices without having to check things yourself every hour on the hour. It should be in the latest version of Google Home so long as you’ve updated your app. [via Google] local_offer    Google   Google Home   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (3) stars Further Reading Google updates Allo to version 9.0 Google Earth announcement coming April 18th Burger King uses "OK Google" commands in ad Nokia commits to fast updates Google Home multi-user support coming soon stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertOnePlus in hot water with fans closeOnePlus has ticked off a lot of people with broken promises OnePlus is currently enjoying their most successful launch yet, but some folks in the community seem keen on raining on their parade to bring some important issues to light. 2 more_vertLG class-action lawsuit expanded closeLG V20, LG G5 and Nexus 5X added to bootloop class-action lawsuit LG is dealing with an ongoing legal battle with consumers who are part of a class action lawsuit for mishandling device issues, and more devices are being added to the list. 3 more_vertOfficial Motorola Power Pack Mod for the Moto Z/Force/Play delayed closeMotorola’s official Power Pack Mod for the Moto Z/Force/Play has been delayed until later this spring The official Motorola Power Pack for the Moto Z was supposed to be due out in March.

COMMENT The company has seen £2.5 million in sales of its leather bags Ben Lobel Maxwell Scott is a luxury online retailer selling Italian leather goods, based in the UK. Here, managing director William Forshaw discusses how he increased revenues from £1 million to £2.5 million in the last two years.. 1. When did you start the business, why, and what were you doing before this. After graduating from university in 2000, I went to work for a big advertising agency in London as an account executive. At the time, this was my dream job, however, after working in the industry for just a short period of time, I realised that this career path wasn’t going to excite me. During this time, my mother was travelling around Italy and meeting some fantastic people during her escapades through the Alps and around the riviera. She often brought a selection of beautifully-crafted leather bags home for her friends that she’d pick up from markets or small factories along the way. This soon developed into handbag events. She would throw parties at her home in Yorkshire and sell these exquisite one-off bags to her peers. After an opportunity arose for a corporate sale at an investment bank in London, I offered to help. The rest, as they say, is history. 2.Talk about the early days of the business. My first real attempt at expansion was making the decision to attend retail exhibitions. This produced greater cash flow and enabled me to quickly build a customer database. However, there were so many to choose, it was tricky to work out which ones would be fruitful and worthwhile. So in the early days it was very hit and miss. I very much learned from my mistakes. I also found it very frustrating to manage stock in the early days. For example, with the big shows, it was often the case that we would never have the right levels of stock to meet the demand. I learned quickly that it was important to manage inventory incredibly carefully if I wanted the business to be profitable. As online technology has gradually occupied the main focus of the business, the main obstacle I have had to confront is SEO. As an e-commerce business, it’s vitally important to drive traffic through Google organic. Over the years, as Google has changed and developed its algorithms, we have not been best placed to deal with these changes. This has caused me many sleepless nights. 3. What was the single ‘turning point’ moment for the business and its revenues? There are two protruding turning points that spring to the forefront of my mind when I contemplate this. Number one is the decision to expand the company internationally. As a consequence of building specific websites tailored to varied worldwide markets, it became evident that in order to get the penetration we wanted, employing native staff was essential. Secondly, in 2014, we decided to completely rebrand the business. Although this was a tricky task due to a lack of funding, it was crucial in order to keep the brand fresh and competitive within the industry. Unfortunately, as a result of this, I had to layoff two members of staff. This was a devastating moment for me, however it was a decision I regretfully had to make to keep the business afloat. After the initial settling in period of the rebrand, we have seen a 500 per cent increase in turnover. For me, this was a classic example of having to take the rough with the smooth in order to succeed in business. 4. From that point, how did your business scale? Any other key moments that contributed to success? It became super apparent to me that hiring the right staff was of the utmost importance, even if it did mean paying a little extra. I am extremely proud of the team we have, as they are all experts in their field. When hiring, I always think to myself, ‘Can this person do a significantly better job than me in their defined role?’. If the answer is a ‘yes’ without any hesitation, I know that they are suitable to work for Maxwell Scott. I prefer to keep all day-to-day work in-house to create a hub where the brand is at the heart. Using the right agencies can work, however I feel that the strength of our in-house team has significantly contributed to our success in recent years. 5. How can similar companies in the sector learn from your success? It’s important to build a secure structure from the ground upwards. It can feel like a slog sometimes, but slow and steady really does win the race. Trying to run before you can walk could seriously damage your business in the long term. Don’t focus too heavily on competition – it can be a waste of energy and sways your focus. Constantly striving to improve your product or service is absolutely imperative. Ensuring you maintain quality and desirability should always be at the forefront of your mind. Finally, if you don’t take calculated risks, you won’t reach your full potential. The word ‘calculated’ is key here – don’t take risks on a whim and just hope they will pay off. Make sure you have at least five valid reasons as to why you should take the risk.

The ad, released Wednesday, features an actor dressed as a Burger King employee, who says, "OK, Google: What is the Whopper burger?" The line is meant to trigger the device to reel off the definition of a Whopper using the first line of the burger's Wikipedia page. Roughly three hours after the ad launched, the ad stopped working. Google's Home would only light up in response to the commercial's prompt and stay mum (although it will give you the first line of the Wikipedia article if you explicitly request the definition of a "Whopper burger"). Share this story File: Image The fast-food company confirmed that the ad no longer triggers the speaker, but it said that it will still air the ad, and indicated that the ad may start working again. "You'll have to tune in tonight to see if the commercial triggers the Whopper sandwich definition response," said Burger King Spokesman, Brooke Scher Mogan. Mogan said Burger King saw the ad as an opportunity to "do something exciting with the emerging technology of intelligent personal assistant devices." Google did not respond to requests for comment. A person familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak on the record said the fast-food chain did not consult Google before making the commercial. While commercials often those about home hubs have accidentally triggered voice assistants in people's homes before, this seems to be the first time an ad has tried to do it intentionally. Based on comments on the ad's YouTube page, many consumers did not appreciate having their devices hijacked. "When you take over someone’s phone or tablet and have it do your own remote commands intentionally, you are HACKING," read one comment. In fact, it may be a blessing for Burger King that the ad no longer works as intended because the advertisement almost immediately backfired on the fast-food chain. Once the ad started gaining attention, Wikipedia users began altering the first line of the article about Burger King's Whopper. These edits included references to the burger as "cancer-causing" and stating that its ingredients include "cyanide." It appears that Burger King itself tried to fix the Wikipedia problem. The first sentence changed to a suspiciously glowing description of the Whopper, authored by user "Fermachado123" a name that sounds similar to, Fernando Machado, Burger King's senior vice president for global brand management. Burger King did not confirm or deny that,  Machado edited the article. Privacy concerns about voice-activated speakers and the connected home have been on the rise as more companies have introduced these products, putting pressure on the makers of voice operated security systems and door locks to ensure that their devices can't be triggered by unauthorized voices. The place of advertising on the Google Home and similar products has been thoroughly debated by users as they have become more commonplace. Many users don't want to be spammed with ads delivered by what they consider personal assistants. Google subjected itself to criticism after Home users heard what appeared to be an unprompted plug for Disney's "Beauty and Beast" when the film opened last month. Google said at the time that mentioning the film wasn't meant to be an ad but simply a notice to users about what was timely that day, according to a statement provided to CNET. "We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case," a Google spokesman said.

We’re talking about it because I would like to suggest that was the entire aim of this commercial. The media, not your Google Home, has been hacked by Burger King. We have no concrete numbers detailing just how many Google Home devices have been sold to date, but in October 2016, Strategy Analytics estimated that the total number of digital home assistant devices shipped by Google and Amazon would reach around 3 million in 2017. So let us assume for a moment that Google, entering the market a little later than Amazon did with the Echo, has sold 700,000 units to date. That would mean that if each sold device lived in one household, the maximum number of homes in which this commercial would work 700,000. (That number is likely a little less, given that some households may own more than one Home.) That number also has to assume that everyone who bought a Google Home had set it close enough to the TV and had their TV tuned to one of the channels airing the commercial for the ad to work. That’s a hell of a lot of assumption. It makes absolutely no sense — until you consider the demographics Even taking into account those people who own Android phones running version 6.0 and up, or the owners of watches running Android Wear 2.0, the total potential audience for a targeted advertising campaign for a brand like Burger King is miniscule. It makes absolutely no sense — until you consider the demographics. I suspect that a significant majority of people who have bought a Google Home device are early adopters. Early adopters tend to be in the younger, 18- to 34-year-old demographic, which is a hugely important target market for advertisers. So it’s easy to see why Burger King would aim for this extremely lucrative market. But there’s just one big snag: cord cutting. Though the age range of cord cutters is growing, 18- to 34-year-olds still make up the largest segment by far. Targeting the small number of early adopters who own a Google Home, still have cable, and who watch TV commercials seems limitedly niche — unless, of course, that was never Burger King’s aim. It appears that its aim was to create a commercial that would tap into the target demographic’s concerns for intrusive advertising and invasion of their privacy. In turn, this would grab the attention of digital and traditional media who would write about those issues at length and generate tens of millions of dollars of free media and bucket loads of engagement. In that vein, Burger King’s campaign is a stunning success. It even managed to get around Google’s hasty block from letting the ad trigger Google Homes by releasing an alternate version during the prime-time slot it bought. Of course, this is all conjecture on my part. If the aim of David, the creative agency in Miami that made the Burger King Google Home TV spot, was to create a short, sharp, viral commercial that would generate a digital media storm and the attention of the most valuable demographic advertising, then it deserves every Lion in Cannes. If this was just a happy accident, then the team should hit the nearest casino because clearly they have hit the mother lode of luck. Regardless, the one thing I do know is that Burger King did cause quite a stir on Wikipedia. If Burger King gained any success revenues from this ad, maybe it should consider donating a little something as a gesture of good will to the editors at Wikipedia, who undoubtedly had a bit of a nightmare dealing with the edit wars yesterday.

Home > Google News > Burger King Spams Google Home With New TV Commercial Burger King Spams Google Home With New TV Commercial Apr 13, 2017 • 7:43 am | (23) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story There is a new spam game in town, those who try to trigger your Google Home device or Google Assistant to start talking to you. A new Burger King ad, as reported by The Verge aimed at triggering Google Home devices to start talking to you about their Whopper burger. The ad said "OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?" Google disabled this question from triggering an answer on Google devices within 3 hours of the commercial airing. Here is the ad: There are many podcasts and radio shows that simply will not say the trigger words for Google Home, Alexa and Siri. They try hard not to set off devices and here you have Burger King specifically trying to do just that on national TV. It is a pretty sleazy kind of thing to do but I doubt they thought it was sleazy, they probably thought it was clever. I would definitely classify this as some sort of spam technique that will eventually be added to Google's guidelines somewhere. Forum discussion at WebmasterWorld.

'Mission 2020' bid to get emissions falling in three years Joe Ware 13th April 2017 Tweet Never mind the climate idiocy that has gripped the USA! Global emissions are already flatlining, writes Joe Ware, and a new initiative just launched in London aims to start pulling them down by 2020. Sure it's ambitious, but it's possible - because the future is unlike the past, and it's already happening, right now. Are you up for the challenge? You build a car to keep the occupant safe by putting enough steel around them so that when you crash it into a wall the person survives. But if you could build cars that didn't crash into walls, you could use a lot less steel. "It's time to swallow the alarm clock!" This was how former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres launched Mission2020 this week, a new campaign to ensure that 2020 is the year global emissions start to decline. The launch event took place at Google's glitzy London office and featured the likes of renowned climate economist Lord Nick Stern and Astro Teller of Google X, the mysterious 'moonshot factory' that comes up with the company's more ambitious projects like Google Glass and driverless cars. He spoke via video link up from, what I liked to imagine, was some top secret subterranean lab under the mountains of California. However the star of the show was Figueres, the veteran Costa Rican diplomat who stepped down as Secretary General of the UN's climate change secretariat following the successful Paris Agreement in 2015. She has launched this new venture so that the good work of Paris is not lost and to ensure the sense of urgency about global decarbonisation is internalised - hence her clock-swallowing metaphor. A big challenge - but an achievable one! Mission2020 is a three-pronged call to arms: peaking global emissions within the next three years is "necessary, desirable and achievable". It's a daunting task. Scientists insist that we must start to bend this emission curve before the next Olympic Games. But Figueres, with the zeal of an evangelist, made the case that the challenge had to be confronted head on: "Is this challenging? Absolutely it is. But we're on our way. For the last three years we've seen flat global emissions while global economic growth has increased 2-3 % a year." She listed off some of the progress already made, such as the need for 30% of global grid electricity to be renewable by 2020 and how we're already at 23.7%, as well as some of the intimidating tasks to overcome. She said we had to end deforestation by 2020 and cited plans by the Indian Government for the country to have 100% electric vehicles by 2030. Such high ambitions sound unlikely, sitting where we do in the second quarter of 2017. But Astro Teller used history to shed some useful light on the kind of unlikely achievements we've already accomplished: "When I was a child at the height of the Cold War, we were making nuclear weapons at a ferocious rate. The idea that in 35 years time, there would be one sixth of the nuclear weapons would have been laughable, but, as a species, we managed it. "There was also the idea, back in the 19th Century, that we thought we would run out of fertiliser and run out food and that millions of people would starve. However in 1909 artificial fertiliser was created in a lab, and just four years later it was in mass production through the Haber-Bosch process. For every story about technology ruining our lives I see stories of how technology can save them." The low-carbon future that's already happening Teller pointed out that such expectation busting leaps were already been hinted at in the decarbonisation race. The first was the recent announcement that Deep Mind, the UK created machine learning system bought by Google in 2014, had found a way of saving 40% of the energy used in Google's data centres. Likewise self-driving cars could be another boon for the climate: "At the moment you build a car to keep the occupant safe by putting enough steel around them so that when you crash it into a wall the person survives. But if you could build cars that didn't crash into walls, you could use a lot less steel." Not only would this reduce the carbon footprint of vehicle manufacture, it would also be lighter and so use less energy. And cars that drove themselves would also likely drive more efficiently with less sudden stops and starts, also reducing energy use. If all this sounds like environmentalist sci-fi, economist Lord Stern, said this low carbon future was no fantasy: "This is the global growth story. This is the demand boost that the world needs. By 2030 we need to reduce emissions by 20% and in that time we will double the amount of infrastructure the world needs. If that new economy looks anything like the old economy then we won't make it. It's radical change but it's extremely attractive change." Some of these attractive 'co-benefits' of decarbonisation include improvements to transportation systems, the preservation of natural resources, cities with cleaner air and better health. I don't care what people talk about, as long as they are decarbonising! Concluding the session by answering a question from the audience, Figueres said that although she was grateful to be in the Google offices, the search engine, along with twitter and other social media channels meant we often end up reading things we already agree with and speaking to the green bubble. "We need to get out of the bubble. Talking to ourselves is not going to get it done." She added that it was important the climate change debate spoke to people's real concerns: "I don't mind if people aren't talking about climate change - people will be motivated by the things they care about. Like in China, the wonderful progress there has been due to concerns around health and air quality. "I don't care what people talk about, as long as they are decarbonising!"     Joe Ware is a journalist and writer at Christian Aid and a New Voices contributor to The Ecologist.

Yesterday GOOG: 823.56 -0.76 Hyundai Blue Link now works with Google Assistant/Home Ben Schoon - Apr. 13th 2017 6:54 am PT @NexusBen Apps & Updates Google Home Google Assistant Hyundai View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Following its announcement earlier this year, Hyundai has today announced that its integration with Google Assistant is available for BlueLink users on recent Hyundai vehicles. The best gifts for Android users Hyundai’s BlueLink platform, which is now standard on the company’s new 2017 IONIQ models, as well as all of its 2018 vehicles, allows users to remotely control several aspects of their vehicles. For example, users can start their vehicles, set climate control, send directions to the on-board navigation, or unlock/lock the vehicle among other functions. Starting today, that functionality is available via Google Assistant/Google Home. Assistant/Home will be limited simply to commands, not alerts, but it’s pretty cool what users will be able to do with just their voice. To get things going, all users need to do is link their BlueLink account with their Google account. Remote commands should work from there without a hitch, but it will ask the user for their PIN to confirm certain commands. Below are a few examples that Hyundai gives showing what this new integration can allow. “Ok Google, tell Blue Link to send the address of the nearest Starbucks to my Santa Fe.” “The address I found for the nearest Starbucks is 350 Fifth Ave, New York, New York. Would you like to send it to your blue Santa Fe?.” “Yes.” “A request to send point of interest has been sent.” “Ok Google, what is the weather like today?” “Today’s forecast for Ann Arbor is 38 degrees with rain and snow.” “Ok Google, ask Blue Link to Start my Tucson and set the temperature to 75 degrees.” “To remote start and set climate control of your black Tucson to 75 degrees, please say your Blue Link PIN. Or, say cancel.” “9115.” “A request to remote start and set climate control has been sent.” “Ok Google, tell Blue Link to start charging my IONIQ” “To remote start charging your gray IONIQ, please say your Blue Link PIN. Or, say cancel.” “1978.” “A request to remote charge has been sent.” All of this functionality and more is available today. The BlueLink app is available now for Google Assistant/Google Home users via the Google Home app on Android and iOS.

Some argue the virtues of a good walk, others rely on group brainstorms or pinpoint their success to a light-bulb moment. The best business ideas solve a problem, as Chris Thomason explains in his blog on creativity. If your startup does this, then you may have taken the first step towards a successful enterprise. Next you need to test demand and adapt your offering as the market, and your customers’ needs, change. You might even need to pivot your business. For some this might mean a side product becomes the core business, for others that a free model turns into a subscription-only service. In a business, there is always a need for new ideas. You might be seeking a novel marketing approach, a fresh route to funding or a product redesign. As you take on staff, you must nurture a culture that encourages and rewards creativity. But the practicalities of running a company are also in play, including maintaining a healthy cashflow and responding to industry changes. The Brexit vote has brought about many potential challenges for businesses, and they must innovate or pivot their business to survive. Whether it’s attracting tourists with the help of the weak pound or opening up an office overseas to avoid the effects of a potentially poor trade deal. Questions we will aim to cover in this webchat include: The tried and tested steps to creativity How to innovate on a tight budget How to pivot your business idea How to identify, and reward, good ideas The secrets of an innovative workplace How to forecast and plan for market changes When to invest in outside help How to protect your business as it grows Updated at 11.09am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close Topics Guardian Small Business Network Adventures in Business Entrepreneurs Marketing & PR Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Guardian Small Business Network › Small business back to top US world science US politics business Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us advertise with us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A touch of a finger unlocks the phone — no password required. With services like Apple Pay or Android Pay, a fingerprint can buy a bag of groceries, a new laptop or even a $1 million vintage Aston Martin. And pressing a finger inside a banking app allows a user to pay bills or transfer thousands of dollars. While such wizardry is convenient, it has also left a gaping security hole. New findings published Monday by researchers at New York University and Michigan State University suggest that smartphones can easily be fooled by fake fingerprints digitally composed of many common features found in human prints. In computer simulations, the researchers from the universities were able to develop a set of artificial “MasterPrints” that could match real prints similar to those used by phones as much as 65 percent of the time. The researchers did not test their approach with real phones, and other security experts said the match rate would be significantly lower in real-life conditions. Still, the findings raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of fingerprint security on smartphones. “It’s almost certainly not as worrisome as presented, but it’s almost certainly pretty darn bad,” said Andy Adler, a professor of systems and computer engineering at Carleton University in Canada, who studies biometric security systems. “If all I want to do is take your phone and use your Apple Pay to buy stuff, if I can get into 1 in 10 phones, that’s not bad odds.” Full human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but the finger scanners on phones are so small that they read only partial fingerprints. When a user sets up fingerprint security on an Apple iPhone or a phone that runs Google’s Android software, the phone typically takes eight to 10 images of a finger to make it easier to make a match. And many users record more than one finger — say, the thumb and forefinger of each hand. Since a finger swipe has to match only one stored image to unlock the phone, the system is vulnerable to false matches. “It’s as if you have 30 passwords and the attacker only has to match one,” said Nasir Memon, a professor of computer science and engineering at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering, who is one of three authors of the study, which was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security. The other authors are Aditi Roy, a postdoctoral fellow at NYU’s Tandon School, and Arun Ross, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State. Dr. Memon said their findings indicated that if you could somehow create a magic glove with a MasterPrint on each finger, you could get into 40 to 50 percent of iPhones within the five tries allowed before the phone demands the numeric password, known as a personal identification number. Apple said the chance of a false match in the iPhone’s fingerprint system was 1 in 50,000 with one fingerprint enrolled. Ryan James, a company spokesman, said Apple had tested various attacks when developing its Touch ID system, and also incorporated other security features to prevent false matches. Google declined to comment. The actual risk is difficult to quantify. Apple and Google keep many details of their fingerprint technology secret, and the dozens of companies that make Android phones can adapt Google’s standard design in ways that reduce the level of security. Stephanie Schuckers, a professor at Clarkson University and director of the Center for Identification Technology Research, was cautious about the implications of the MasterPrint findings. She said the researchers used a midrange, commercially available software program that was designed to match full fingerprints, limiting the broader applicability of their findings. “To really know what the impact would be on a cellphone, you’d have to try it on the cellphone,” she said. She noted that cellphone makers and others who use fingerprint security systems are studying anti-spoofing techniques to detect the presence of a real finger, such as looking for perspiration or examining patterns in deeper layers of skin. A new fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm, for example, uses ultrasound. Phone makers have acknowledged that fingerprint sensors are not foolproof, but said that the ease of touching a finger to unlock a phone meant that more users actually turned on security features instead of leaving their phones unlocked — a common habit in the early days of smartphones. Dr. Ross acknowledged the limitations of the work. “Most of the current smartphone vendors do not give us access to the fingerprint image,” he said. For a thief or spy to turn master fingerprints into smartphone keys would require a lot of additional work. “In order to launch this attack, you still have to make fake fingers,” Dr. Ross said. Still, the team’s fundamental finding that partial fingerprints are vulnerable to spoofing is significant, said Chris Boehnen, the manager of the federal government’s Odin program, which studies how to defeat biometric security attacks as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. “What’s concerning here is that you could find a random phone, and your barrier to attack is pretty low,” Dr. Boehnen said. Phone makers could easily increase security by making it harder to match the partial fingerprint, he said, “but the average phone company is more worried about you being annoyed that you have to put your finger against the phone two or three times than they are with someone breaking into it.” The New York Times Vindu Goel More Posts Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Related AppleGooglesmartphones Previous ArticleSuspects in Kim Jong Nam Killing Appear in Malaysia Court HearingNext Article10 Talking Points from the Weekend’s Upcoming Premier League Games What’s Trending Amaq – 24/7 News Agency Run by ISIS 39098 Saudi Sources: the Ultimate Solution in Yemen will Put an End to the Militias 28806 Crown Prince Patronizes Deluge 6 Exercise 24913 Air Strikes Target al Qaeda in Yemen, Troops Capture Aden District 23408 10,000 More Syrian Refugees to Be Taken in by Canada 22947 Join our social media 264kFans 126kFollowers 252Followers Subscribe to News Asharq Al-awsat Newsletter Email address PRINT SUBSCRIPTIONS DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISING TERMS & CONDITIONS PRIVACY STATEMENT ABOUT US SUBMISSIONS © Copyright 2016 Asharq Al Awsat - Sub Division of SRPC - Site Last updated April 14, 2017 8:01 am Middle East Opinion Saudi Arabia Features World Lifestyle This website uses cookies to improve your experience.

A TV ad for the fast food giant featured an actor using key words to trigger the device to upload information about its burgers. "OK, Google," says the actor. "What is the Whopper burger?" Video of BURGER KING® | Connected Whopper® The marketers hoped that Google Home would spring into life in homes all over the US and begin reading the the Wikipedia entry for the burger, which originally said:  "The Whopper is a hamburger sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger  King…" It would then list the ingredients in detail. However, says Sky News, Burger King seemed "to have forgotten how Wikipedia works". As the online encyclopaedia can be edited by anybody, the page for the Whopper burger was modified almost as soon as the ad was released. Instead of listing the likes of "100 per cent beef" and "sliced tomatoes", Google Home assistants told viewers the burger contained "rat meat" and "cyanide", was "the worst hamburger product" and "cancer-causing". Burger King's Wikipedia page has now been locked and can only be edited by authorised administrators. With all the publicity, says The Verge, "maybe you still have the Whopper on your mind so perhaps the ad did its job after all". However, if Burger King executives were rubbing their hands with glee, they were soon disappointed. Within three hours of the ad being released, continues the Verge, Google itself put a spanner in the works. Users can still ask the device about the Whopper themselves – and thanks to Wikipedia, they get a straight answer - but the internet giant appears to have "registered the sound clip from the ad to disable unwanted Home triggers". Burger King says the ad was developed without reference to Google, while Google has refused to comment. It remained unclear last night whether Burger King could alter the ad to work around the search engine's changes before it aired on TV in very expensive slots, said the New York Times.

CBS/Reuters April 13, 2017, 9:41 AM Burger King makes a whopper of a mess with Google Home ad Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Burger King may have been aiming for an eye-catching ad, but instead it was hit by a whopper-sized prank.  The fast-food chain on Wednesday said it would start televising a commercial for its signature Whopper sandwich that is designed to activate Google (GOOG) voice-controlled devices, such as Google Home. While the ad raised questions about whether marketing tactics have become too invasive, it also highlighted how marketing messages can get subverted by Internet users.  The ad nudged consumers to ask Google devices to read out Wikipedia’s entry on the Whopper, prompting pranksters to edit the burger’s Wiki entry to add ingredients such as cyanide, according to The Associated Press. Another edit described the Whopper as “the worst hamburger product” sold by the restaurant chain.  The 15-second ad starts with a Burger King employee holding up the sandwich saying, “You’re watching a 15-second Burger King ad, which is unfortunately not enough time to explain all the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich. But I’ve got an idea. OK, Google, what is the Whopperburger?” Play Video CBS This Morning Privacy concerns for smart dolls and home devices? Some of the hottest buys these days are internet-connected devices, like the Amazon Echo and Google Home. They use voice recognition technology t... If a viewer has the Google Home assistant or an Android phone with voice search enabled within listening range of the TV, that last phrase - “Hello Google, what is the Whopper burger?” - is intended to trigger the device to search for Whopper on Google and read out the finding from Wikipedia. “Burger King saw an opportunity to do something exciting with the emerging technology of intelligent personal assistant devices,” said a Burger King representative. Burger King, owned by Restaurant Brands International (QSR), said the ad is not in collaboration with Google.  Google declined to comment and Wikipedia was not available for comment. The ad, which became available on YouTube on Wednesday, will run nationally during prime-time on networks such as Spike, Comedy Central, MTV, E! and Bravo, and also on late-night shows starring Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon. Some media outlets, including CNN Money, reported that Google Home stopped responding to the commercial shortly after the ad became available on YouTube. Burger King said it believed Google was behind the changes that blocked the commercial from waking up devices, according to The New York Times. Still, the devices continued to respond to users’ voices.  Voice-powered digital assistants such as Google Home and Amazon’s Echo have been largely a novelty for consumers since Apple’s Siri introduced the technology to the masses in 2011. The devices can have a conversation by understanding context and relationships, and many use them for daily activities such as sending text messages and checking appointments. Many in the industry believe the voice technology will soon become one of the main ways users interact with devices, and Apple, Google and Amazon are racing to present their assistants to as many people as possible.  Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Featured in Moneywatch 20 of the coolest places to retire in the world Find out what activities and attractions make these 20 cities and town some of the best places to retire around the world 10 products you should never buy generic Generics are a great way to save money in lots of cases, but here is a look at some clear exceptions Popular Market Data Latest Features Target recalls these water-absorbing toys Postal Service to offer new way to see what's heading to you McDonald's CEO sees big pay bump as restaurant chain rebounds PayPal CEO on the future of cash Online consignment is big business and a bargain hunter's heaven Market News Moneywatch Spotlight 5 cars turning heads at the New York Auto Show 7 lighthouse homes that really shine Living with history: 200-year-old houses for sale 5 cars you really ought to test drive Tax-friendly states for retirees Stock Watchlist New Fire TV App Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

Currently, Google has partnered with some of India's leading online restaurants - FreshMenu, Box8 and Fassos to facilitate food ordering on Areo. The service currently lacks any traditional restaurants, but a description of the app says the app will collate restaurants, providers and chefs. Google will even facilitate payments either by credit/debit card, net banking and will also offer customers the option to pay service providers directly in cash. The company hasn't divulged any details of the service just yet, and it isn't clear if it charges a fee for every transaction. While Google has traditionally chosen to partner with service aggregators, acting as a meta aggregator in some sense, with Areo the company seems to be going head to head with services such as Swiggy, FoodPanda and Zomato. While only a few online players are part of the service for now, Google already has a large pool of offline restaurants who list themselves on the platform to be discovered by customers via Maps or its other services. Further, the entry of a large player like Google could upset the balance which has returned to the FoodTech space in India which saw a bloodbath in 2016. Apart from online food ordering, Google is also looking to collate home services such as electricians, plumbers, beauticians on-demand. The company has so far tied up with Urban Clap, one of the leading home service providers in the country today. However, it is highly unlikely that Google will enable delivery services like other players such as Swiggy and FoodPanda. Google has remained mum on the launch of the service in India, suggesting that it's still a pilot the company is running in two of India's most tech savvy cities. As for the foodtech space in the country, high costs of customer acquisition and high customer attrition are among the major issues players have faced, but Google could be at an advantage because of its massive reach and control of the AdWords pipeline to bring in customers.

Alnoor Peermohamed Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Google takes a swing at online food ordering with new app Areo Google already has a large pool of offline restaurants who list themselves on the platform Internet search giant Google is looking to take a swing at India's extremely turbulent FoodTech space and has launched Areo, an app that aggregates food delivery and home services for customers in Bengaluru and Mumbai. Currently, Google has partnered with some of India's leading online restaurants - FreshMenu, Box8 and Fassos to facilitate food ordering on Areo. The service currently lacks any traditional restaurants, but a description of the app says the app will collate restaurants, providers and chefs. Google will even facilitate payments either by credit/debit card, net banking and will also offer customers the option to pay service providers directly in cash. The company hasn't divulged any details of the service just yet, and it isn't clear if it charges a fee for every transaction. While Google has traditionally chosen to partner with service aggregators, acting as a meta aggregator in some sense, with Areo the company seems to be going head to head with services such as Swiggy, FoodPanda and Zomato. While only a few online players are part of the service for now, Google already has a large pool of offline restaurants who list themselves on the platform to be discovered by customers via Maps or its other services. Further, the entry of a large player like Google could upset the balance which has returned to the FoodTech space in India which saw a bloodbath in 2016. Apart from online food ordering, Google is also looking to collate home services such as electricians, plumbers, beauticians on-demand. The company has so far tied up with Urban Clap, one of the leading home service providers in the country today. However, it is highly unlikely that Google will enable delivery services like other players such as Swiggy and FoodPanda.

Many, including myself, were very upset at the news as this is the primary way to receive news for a lot of people. Fortunately for us that are news obsessed, we won’t have to live without news updates after Reader’s end this summer. The social news site, Digg, is planning on releasing it’s own RSS reader soon. The company announced on its blog that the project to build a reader is under way and should be released some time this year. Apparently, Digg had already decided that it was going to build a reader, but due to the unexpected announcement yesterday by Google, the company decided that now was the time to work on the project. Digg also plans to keep its reader similar to Google’s and even allow it to sync data with existing programs, such as Flipboard. Are you excited about Digg’s reader, or will you still miss Google Reader? If you have already found a replacement, what is it? Leave us a comment and let us know!

You are here: Blog Share 13 April, 2017 All the digital news stories you missed this week By Ben Davis @ Econsultancy 0 comments Robert Graves in an addendum to his autobiography said that people like to read about food and drink, murders, ghosts and, most of all, battles. While I can't claim they all feature in this week's digital news roundup, it's nevertheless a corker. Facebook Instant Articles on the wane? Digiday carries a thorough report on the decline of Facebook's Instant Articles, as publishers realise its monetisation potential isn't as high as they would like. The New York Times, one of the initial partners, has ceased Instant Articles after finding links back to the Times’ own site monetized better. Kinsey Wilson, EVP of product and technology at the Times, told Digiday that "people were also more likely to subscribe to the Times if they came directly to the site rather than through Facebook." Though Wilson said the withdrawal wasn't irreversible, Facebook is going to have to work hard to improve the feature's appeal. SNL Pepsi spoof If you're not in the US you may not have seen this week's spoof of last week's biggest story. Bixby delayed Samsung's intelligent assistant for the S8 handset sounds really cool. It will help users search, including a visual search tool, will categorise photographs and help people use apps more easily with voice commands. The feature was a big part of the press coverage in the lead up to the S8 launch, but it appears it is only currently available in a Korean version. Bixby will not be available in English until later this spring in the US. Until then, people with the handset will have to make do with Google Assistant, which is bundled into the Android OS. Google launches Auto Draw Google's new app is pretty cool. You can use the auto draw functionality and a carousel will suggest professionally drawn pictures based on your own infantile free-form scratchings. In a very simple example below, I drew a few basic lines which I then transformed into a lovely baguette taking a ride in a car. The app works on mobile or desktop. Machine learning has never been so fun. It's such a quick-to-use tool, I can see it being of use for some basic design tasks. OK Google, what is the Whopper burger? Burger King released a sneaky and pretty smart ad this week (watch it below). The ad is designed to activate the Google Assistant on viewer's phones. A spokesman told Reuters: "Burger King saw an opportunity to do something exciting with the emerging technology of intelligent personal assistant devices." Reports suggest that on becoming aware of the ad, Google may have stepped in to prevent it from setting off its devices. Google itself has not commented. Uber head of comms leaves Uber execs continue to leave. This time it's Rachel Whetstone, head of policy and comms, who has amicably resigned. More from NYT. Trump's tweets to be preserved The White House is saving all of Trump's tweets, even the deleted ones riddled with typos. The National Archives and Records Administration confirmed as such in a letter to senators last week. Your children and your children's children will be able to see beauties such as these. In response to a video in which Snoop points a gun at a Trump-esque clown Tesla now valued at more than GM and Ford Tesla topped Ford last week, and this week eclipsed GM, with its market capitalization hitting $50.9bn on Monday. Musk’s company is now within $1bn of Honda, which is the fifth most valuable manufacturer worldwide. More from Bloomberg. Flipkart buys eBay India Flipkart, India's biggest ecommerce company, has raised $1.4bn in its latest investment round, with money from eBay, Microsoft and Tencent. As part of the deal with eBay, Flipkart will buy eBay's Indian business (and get some cash along with it). Flipkart and eBay will still operate separately in the country, though. Devin Wenig, president and CEO of eBay says: “The combination of eBay’s position as a leading global ecommerce company and Flipkart’s market stature will allow us to accelerate and maximize the opportunity for both companies in India.” Instagram updates its DM feature Photos and videos now appear in regular messages alongside text. The following video shows the revamped messaging in action.   Asda launches on JD.com Walmart's UK retailer Asda will launch a store on JD.com, China's second biggest ecommerce platform after Alibaba. The store will sell food and health products to JD.com's more than 230m customers. The products will come from the UK. More on this story. JD.com to sell from rural franchises In other JD.com news, the company is partnering with rural convenience stores to provide JD products and branding. The move echoes that of Alibaba, which recently partnered with a big supermarket group. Both strategies are an attempt to tie up online and offline sales, and get more traction outside of cities.

Google expands WebVR to Google Cardboard, adds 12 new WebVR demos to try out Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/12 1:56pm PDTApr 12, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares98 Cardboard Daydream VR Today, Google took another step forward in its efforts to expand the availability of VR. Back in February, we reported that Chrome 56 added support for WebVR, but it was restricted to those with Daydream-ready phones. Now, the platform has opened to all Android phones compatible with Google Cardboard. Taking advantage of WebVR, you can access a variety of experimental VR experiences through the Chrome web browser on your phone or computer. To make these VR worlds more easily accessible, Google launched a web page today where developers can showcase their creations. The page, when accessed with your phone or computer, provides a selection of experiences that users can click through to activate. The website allows you to access the experiences on your computer, but to get the true VR experience, you will need to use Google Daydream or Cardboard. If you access them on your computer, you will enter a 360-degree image or 2D interface controlled by the mouse on your computer. Some of these experiences do require a controller or Daydream functionality, so not all work with Cardboard, either. Currently, the site offers 12 different choices. One of the more interesting new interfaces uses voice to control the experience. In "Speak to Go," you say the destination you would like to visit and you are taken to 360-degree images of those locations. Several of them have short demo videos to give you an idea of what to expect before you begin. All of them have links to GitHub where developers can find source code to aid them in further development of this platform. With this new website and the open access to source code, Google is expanding its VR efforts and pushing its development forward. These experiments show promise for the growing platform.

Within the space of 3 years, it has become significantly easier to find businesses, stores or items nearby, creating a shift in user’s intent and search behavior. Users no longer have to include their location in search queries, such as inputting “coffee shops in Queens” into Google. This trend has given way to the “near me” search query – Google “coffee shop near me” while in Queens, and Google will fetch coffee shops in your local area. According to digital marketing expert Jordan Kasteler, 1 in 3 of all Google searches has local intent. This means users search for and expect local information in SERPs, and now more than ever, priority should be given to optimizing on-site and off-site strategies for local SEO. Below are a few things to note when optimizing for local SEO in 2017. #1: Title tags and meta descriptions still work Title tags and meta descriptions are on-site HTML elements which reflect the content of your page, and are shown in SERPs and browser tabs as text. With Google increasing the width of the SERP to 600px, the length of title tags falls between 40 and 50 characters (best practices) while meta descriptions should be a maximum of 160 characters. Titles display what your page is about to both visitors and search engine crawlers, while meta descriptions summarize the content of your page. Your title tags and meta descriptions must include the keywords you are trying to rank for, for example, “cheap hotels in Las Vegas” (title tag includes a keyword and locality). Titles and meta descriptions must be unique, compelling and descriptive, as this can affect click-through rates from search results to your page. Using the length guidelines above, ensure your title and descriptions are displaying in full on the SERP. Use tools like Yoast’s SEO plugin, SERP preview tool, and SEOmofo to emulate how your title tags and meta description will look in search results. #2: Keyword research Keyword research represents the very foundation of your SEO campaign and when done properly, keywords can drive traffic and rankings for your web pages. Keywords represent terms and phrases people type as search queries to find local businesses. Keyword research for local SEO involves optimizing your web pages for keywords with geo-modifiers – i.e. place names and locations. For a furniture making business, a generic, non-local keyword might be “furniture makers” but for businesses optimizing for local SEO, an acceptable keyphrase would be “furniture makers Portland” or “furniture makers Portland Oregon”. To optimize your keyword research for local SEO, brainstorm keywords or phrases with a geo-modifier that customers might use when searching for a business like yours. Run generated phrases or words through Google Keyword Planner or Keyword.io to get keyword ideas together with monthly search traffic stats. Keyword research can be time-consuming, but rewarding when done properly. For a more in-depth guide, check out our complete guide to keyword research for SEO. #3: Optimize for Google My Business and Bing Places for Business Google My Business, formerly known as Google Places, allows you to display your business hours, phone number and directions to your office on Google Search and Maps. This service is free and will aid your SEO efforts, as your business is listed when customers search for your services. When optimizing your Google My Business page, remember to upload your business logo and photos of your business (staff, office building, etc.). For an online business with no physical location, you can hide your address, but be sure to fill in and validate every other piece of information entered. A misplaced phone number or wrong address can result in you losing customers and revenue. For Bing Places, the process is similar to Google My Business. Though Bing cannot be compared to Google in terms of use and search traffic (3.5 billion searches per day), some customers nevertheless still use the search engine, and you might have what they are in need of.

Google adds rich results for podcasts to SERPs #4: Local structured data Structured data, sometimes referred to as schema markup, are codes which are added to websites to provide search engines with in-depth information about your products, your business offering, prices of your products, location-based offerings and much more. According to ACMQUEUE, a measly 31.3 percent of websites use schema markup, and most of these on a very basic level. Schema markup on your websites make your business stand out in the SERP with things like rich snippets, which in turn will boost your CTR. There are various options for businesses when implementing Schema markup, you can optimize your website according to your business type (dentist, travel agency, etc.), events (business listing in upcoming events) and location (location markup). Google is forcing marketers to use schema markup and is rewarding websites who use this feature as structured data helps crawlers understand your web pages and the content in it. To check if your website is optimized for Schema markup, you can check out Google’s Structured Data Testing Tool. Conclusion The above points are a drop in the ocean for optimizing for local SEO, but implementing the points above will have you generating results and better conversion rates.   Eimantas Balciunas is the CEO of Travel Ticker.

Last Updated: April 13 2017 Article by Julie Lessard and Olga Prygoda BCF Business Law Canada is gaining momentum as a preferred location for nurturing global talent amid uncertainty resulting from recent proposals of the U.S. administration on immigration. Can Canada seize this opportunity of becoming the destination of choice for US investors by continuing to offer highly competitive immigration policies? At the center of headlines worldwide, the Executive Order banning certain foreigners including highly skilled workers with approved work visas and permanent residents from predominantly Muslim countries created serious concerns for U.S. business in the Silicon Valley and throughout North America. In addition, the prospect of a second Executive Order on immigration targeting the H-1B visa programme caused widespread speculations. Although these initiatives are stalled at the moment, the visa ban combined with the possibility of sweeping changes to the H-1B programme, which remains a lifeline for numerous U.S. companies in the IT sector when it comes to recruitment of foreign talent, keep many CEOs and foreign workers on the edge1. One of the first to react, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai told Bloomberg that Google was "concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S."2 � Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos openly stated that his company will rally behind the legal challenge of the ban3. In an unprecedented coordinated action opposing the ban, about 100 technology companies argued in a legal filing last week that undue immigration restrictions damage U.S. competitiveness. The petitioners, including Google, Facebook, Netflix and Apple, argued that "instability and uncertainty" caused by the executive order "will make it far more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to hire some of the world's best talent � and impede them from competing in the global marketplace."4 Career diplomats also seem to agree with the businesses that rushed immigration action would "hurt America economically", according to a widely circulated Dissent Memo of the U.S. Department of State5. The scientific community in the U.S. was equally uneasy, reports from the Harvard University and the University of Toronto mentioning that some leading foreign scientists are "considering coming to Canada for post docs."6 The world financial markets also initially reacted negatively on the rationale that, if increasingly global U.S. corporations are curbed from moving people where they need them, it will hurt their productivity7. "The global investors now characterize this risk premium as "not insignificant", according to Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor in the UK8. The markets seem to question now whether "temporary changes to immigration policy could be a prelude to potentially bigger disruptions..." according to Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Toronto9. In a commentary to the Financial Times, Saker Nusseibeh, Chief Executive of Hermes Investment Management, pointed out that "companies want to employ the best talent in the countries in which they base themselves...If the U.S. is perceived as difficult, and that the ban may be expanded, there are opportunities for London's position..."10. Echoing the analysts, Microsoft Corp. inserted language in a securities filing, cautioning investors that immigration restrictions "may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts.11." It is not the first time that Microsoft is fighting an immigration-fueled controversy. In 2007, the H-1B crisis prompted Microsoft to set up an office in Vancouver, "a global gateway with a diverse population... close to Microsoft's corporate offices in Redmond, allowing the company to recruit and retain highly skilled people affected by immigration issues in the U.S.12" During the following decade, Vancouver has been able to create an ecosystem of IT companies which include satellite offices of U.S. tech giants based on the west coast, but also some genuine home grown start up talent13. The idea of setting up business operations in Canada or in Montr�al to face talent and immigration challenges is by no means new. Current U.S. political climate may give it a new momentum. Many initiatives are already in place in Vancouver to invite US companies to create new subsidiaries as 'talent hosts'. In the Northeast, we can also expect a growing number of opportunities to attract U.S. investments. Qu�bec's advantages for U.S. tech companies are manifold, including its geographic location in the 14 Northeast corridor and New York (EST) time zone comfortably midway between Europe and the West Coast, the presence of a strong IT cluster, and sizeable R&D tax credits for hi-tech companies. In addition, the recent signature of CETA presents further investment opportunities in creating a new corridor of free trade and an extended path for global talent mobility. Canada's "ease of doing business index" is also well recognized and the country's banking system consistently ranks as the most stable amongst the developed economies. Our world-class but definitely affordable education also facilitates building up a pool of available local talent, as Qu�bec achieved one of the highest enrollment and graduation rates in OECD countries. In a just � released 2017 QS Best Student City rankings report Montreal unseated Paris as the "best student city in the world". Subsidiaries of foreign corporations, primarily American and French, already play a key role in Greater Montr�al's economy. Montr�al is home to 2,000 foreign subsidiaries where almost 40% of them belong to these three high-tech clusters: Aerospace, Life Sciences & Health Technology, and Information and Communications Technology15. Within the ICT cluster itself, the fields of Gaming and Virtual Reality (VR), Special Effects & Interactive Media, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are growing fast. AI research has been identified as a priority for The Government of Canada, which recently announced the funding of $213,187,000 (Canada First Research Excellence Fund) to the Universit� de Montr�al, HEC Montr�al, Polytechnique Montr�al and McGill University. The gaming sub-cluster, represented among others by Ubisoft, EA Montr�al, Warner Bros. Games, and dozens of other studios, have been present for some time, transforming Montr�al's old Mile End and Griffintown neighborhoods into rapidly growing areas for the young and hip, where creativity booms, restaurant choices are mind-blowing, and housing is still affordable. With more than 40 VFX and animation studios, Montr�al is also a large post-production hub16. It has been shown that the presence of the strong cluster significantly increases the chances of success of a new venture which would grow within the same ecosystem. In November 2016, Google opened a new AI lab and invested $3.4M in Montr�al-based AI research, with other smaller players quickly following suit17. Speaking to The Toronto Star, Shibl Mourad, Head of engineering for Google's Montr�al office, says "the company hopes to help turn the city into a "super-cluster" of AI knowledge that will attract corporate investors, burgeoning startups and researchers"18. Given the current climate, it may be worthwhile for the U.S. companies who are not yet present in Qu�bec, to seriously consider looking in that direction. Qu�bec and Canada benefit from highly competitive immigration policies intended to support new investment and innovation and provide Canadian employers with access to global talent. Qu�bec administers temporary worker program facilitating entry of highly-skilled workers in the gaming and IT sector, and maintains unique Business Immigration programs, Immigrant Investor and Immigrant Entrepreneur. A recently announced Global Skills Strategy Initiative19 will help companies in the innovative sectors of economy attract foreign talent when they can demonstrate "high growth" potential with respect to local job creation. Foreign companies which will make a substantial investment, relocate their operations, or expand their production in Canada, will benefit from this Initiative, slated for implementation in mid-201720 In the current climate around immigration policies, Canada's positioning as an open country for global talent is ever more a significant competitive advantage for companies seeking an environment favoring the attraction and retention of talent, and the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy a global workforce. More than an island, could Montr�al become one of the next "valleys"?

GroundUp’s Nathan Geffen said the Google advertising model is broken – “not for Google of course, which is massively profitable, but for us, the publishers”. “We had over 320,000 visits to the site from nearly 240,000 users. But we made a paltry R2,754 from Google AdSense from the 329,000 ad impressions,” said Geffen. Geffen said they also tried to address the problem of questionable advertisements with Google, but to no avail. “These dodgy ads continue to appear on some of the world’s biggest news sites, not just small ones like GroundUp.” “Whichever way you cut it, Google’s system doesn’t work for any publication that cares enough not to mislead its readers.” The final straw for GroundUp came when it received a warning notice from Google that the publication had violated Google’s policies. This was due to adverts running in its photo gallery with an image of two semi-nude protestors in an art gallery. “So Google accepts get-rich-quick ads featuring famous people without their permission, but will not let us run those adverts on a page with a photograph of nudity – even if it depicts news in the public interest,” said Geffen. “Obviously the behemoth in Mountain View won’t miss GroundUp, but we take some pride in saying the feeling’s mutual.” Google – No comment Google South Africa was asked for comment regarding its revenue split with publishers, dodgy adverts served through its platform, and its third-party ad policy, but the company did not respond.

‘Russia’s Google’ Is Collecting a Database of Rare Languages Including Elvish. Languages, like species, experience cycles of evolution, proliferation, and often extinction. An estimated 400 languages have died out over the last century, and thousands more are at risk of vanishing by 2100, according to the United Nations' endangered language list. Every dead language represents the loss of invaluable cultural capital, which is why experts passionately support preservation of all extant languages before it's too late. Search engines are becoming a crucial part of the effort to prevent a looming linguistic mass extinction event. With their sophisticated digital translation tools, developed through machine learning, these engines can efficiently analyze large language databases and preserve them for posterity. One of the leaders of this charge is Yandex, a Russian information technology giant often referred to as "Russia's Google," which is a bit of a misnomer since the two companies are actually fierce rivals in Europe. Yandex headquarters in Moscow. Image: Yandex Where Google Translate currently offers 100+ languages, Yandex Translate is close behind with a catalogue of 90. But Yandex has outpaced Google in processing major regional languages within Russia, including Tatar (5.5 million speakers) and Bashkir (1.2 million speakers). The company is also working with linguists to preserve some of Russia's most vulnerable languages, like Mari (500,000 speakers), Udmurt (324,000 speakers), and Hill Mari (23,000 speakers), all of which are available only on Yandex Translate. "Usually, it's the many language enthusiasts who ask us to translate some language," Anton Dvorkovich, a developer at Yandex Translate, told me over email. (This exchange was mediated by Yandex spokesperson Matvey Kireev, who translated Dvorkovich's answers from Russian to English.) "That's what happened with the Mari language, where we had a huge help from the Mari Research Institute of Language, Literature, and History," an academic cultural preservation center located in Yoshkar-Ola, Russia. Dvorkovich and his colleagues are not only focused on languages within Russia, and are working towards cementing Yandex as a world leader in the preservation of endangered dialects that can't be found on other search engines. "We believe that doing what we do helps to preserve rare languages for future generations and allows people to see just how culturally diverse and beautiful our world is," Dvorkovich said. "This is also a story about seeing how peoples of the world have been influencing each other for a very long time—we have never lived in a bubble, and we can see that by analyzing various languages." Read More: Why a Universal Language Will Never Be a Thing A good example of this global language exchange is the little-known Caribbean Creole language Papiamento, which was recently added to Yandex Translate at the suggestion of one of the company's Netherlands-based employees, who happened to be one of an estimated 270,000 native Papiamento speakers in the world. Papiamento is a melting pot language that has borrowed from Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, English, Native American, and African vocabulary groups. Refining all of these ancestral contributions into the extant version of the language proved to be an interesting challenge for Yandex's machine translators. By cross-examining millions of samples of its parent languages against Papiamento excerpts, these automatic translators memorize key patterns and apply them to new words and phrases. Take this visualization below, which illustrates Papiamento's pluralization markers, denoted by "nan," which is borrowed from Spanish patterns of pluralizing with "s" or "es." (The Russian headings marked "папьяменто" and "испанский" mean "Papiamento" and "Spanish"). Image: Yandex Whenever a word does not seem to be pluralized with "nan," the automatic translator notes the exception and looks for a better analog (thus, the question mark sequence). Yandex's algorithms can also analyze complex differences in grammatical structures between languages in order to more accurately translate them. This visualization shows the process of translating the English sentence "I saw a cat" into the Uzbek phrase, "bir mushuk ko'rdim" with the help of Turkish-English parallel texts. Image: Yandex These advanced machine learning tools can even crack fictional languages. Taking a hint from Microsoft's search engine Bing, which debuted Klingon translation in 2013, Yandex Translate became the first engine to add Sindarin Elvish, or "Eglathrin" as it's known to native elven speakers, one of many dialects dreamed up by JRR Tolkien for his Middle Earth epics. Image: Yandex Dvorkovich said the company may add more fictional languages in the future, but the main focus for now is to continue cataloguing and preserving threatened languages. "Our job is never really done," he told me, "because there are so many endangered languages spoken by even fewer people.

Google Trends, a real-time dataset launched in 2006, does not show which candidate is doing better in the presidential race, but provides a perspective on what is on voters' minds. Google Trends predicted Brexit, or Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, and even the election of President Donald Trump. Korea's presidential election will be on May 9, months earlier than scheduled after former President Park Geun-hye was removed from office in March. According to Google Trends, the overall index of Ahn was 42 compared with Moon's 30 as of 4 p.m., Thursday. The maximum Google index is 100 while zero is the lowest. In the wake of the scandal involving the former president and her longtime confidant Choi Soon-sil late last year, Moon had been a dominant presidential candidate, but Ahn has caught up fast of late. Ahn's rise started April 4 when the software mogul-turned-politician won the nomination -- the index showed 54 for Ahn and 42 for Moon at the time. The gap was extended to 100 to 47 on April 6. "Ahn has benefited from the party convention, but Moon has yet to gain an immediate effect as primary rival An Hee-jung's supporters are hesitant to back Moon," a DPK official said. The search trends carry extra weight as an indicator measuring voters' opinions on candidates as the search trends are largely in line with public polls. According to a public survey by cable channel JTBC, Wednesday, Ahn edged Moon 38.3 percent to 38.0 percent, while a Realmeter poll showed, Thursday, that Moon garnered 44.8 percent against Ahn's 36.5 percent. By region, Ahn attracted more search interest in Chungcheong and Jeolla provinces along with Jeju Island, but Moon was ahead of Ahn in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province as well as Gangwon and Gyeongsang provinces. However, Ahn led Moon in Busan 57 to 56, while those from Daejeon were more interested in Moon over Ahn by 62 to 59. Higher interest does not necessarily benefit the candidate, observers said. When rumors were rampant that Ahn mobilized gang members for his election campaign on March 24 due to a photo showing him flanked by stout men in black suits, the most-searched phrase regarding him was "Ahn Cheol-soo gang," which adversely affected his reputation. ksw@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter Ahn continuing to pose threat to Moon Shocking diet plans of female Korean celebs [PHOTOS] North Korea says get ready for 'big event' United Airlines ditched by worldwide boycotts, condemnation [VIDEO] Xi Jinping urges 'peaceful' resolution of North Korea crisis in phone call with Trump N.

By Liam Tung | April 13, 2017 -- 12:21 GMT (05:21 PDT) | Topic: Virtual Reality Google's WebVR Experiments page showcases VR apps and lets others contribute their work. Image: Google Google has launched a new catalog of WebVR virtual-reality apps that can be experienced though an Android phone and Google's budget Cardboard VR viewer. The company wants to bring VR to the web to make it easier for developers to build an app once and then have it work on multiple headsets. special feature VR and AR: The Business Reality Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are going to be useful for far more than just gaming. We explore the ways the technology will be used for training, marketing, product design, and much more. Read More Key to its ambition for people to click a link to launch a VR experience is WebVR, a standard to enable browser support for VR apps made for the web. In other words, for it to succeed, Google believes there shouldn't be limitations like app stores or a requirement for developers to rewrite apps to support different headsets. And there needs to be a cheap entry point for consumers to try it out, which is why it's built Cardboard and the Daydream viewers. It's already enabled WebVR for Daydream, and the addition of Cardboard support means people with an Android phone and its cheap viewer can now try VR by "tapping a link". Consumers will be able to find those links at Google's WebVR Experiments page, which showcases a dozen VR apps and offers a space for others to contribute their work, too. For those interested in contributing, Google is keener on ideas that are experimental rather than complete products. Featured apps include a VR ping-pong called Konterball, a VR music experience featuring the Chemical Brother's Under Neon Lights, and a game called Spot the Bot. The Experiment page offers a link to each app as well as a link to its code, which is hosted on GitHub to help others developers build different VR experiments. The apps can be used with Cardboard or a Daydream View and a compatible Android phone, such as a Pixel. They're also viewable in 2D from Chrome without a headset. Google notes that web support on Chrome for the Oculus Rift and HTC VIVE is "coming soon". To use these higher performance desktop headsets today, you need to use the nightly version of either Chrome or Firefox.
